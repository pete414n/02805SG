'''Doctor Fate''' (also known as '''Fate''') is the name of multiple [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The original version of the character was created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist Howard Sherman, debuting in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #55 (May 1940). The character has appeared in various incarnations, with Doctor Fate being the name of several different individuals in the [[DC Universe]] as part of a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerous]] [[Legacy hero|legacy]] with several attempts to revitalize the character.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":03"/><ref name="newsarama1" />

In the [[DC Universe]] continuity, Doctor Fate was originally conceived as a force fighting against the supernatural being [[Nabu (comics)|'''Nabu''']], a cosmic being affiliated with the Lords of Order, [[Mesopotamian deities]],<ref>Note: Throughout the character's history, despite being referenced in Mesopotamia as early as ''1st Issue Special'' #9, he is erroneously stated to be Egyptian.</ref> and a chief enemy of his cosmic opposites, the Lords of Chaos. Over time, Nabu instead empowered mortal agents to act on his behalf and the Lords of Order, the first being [[Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson)|'''Kent Nelson''']], the Strauss family, and various others. Other versions of the character differ, acting as solely supernatural-based heroes, affiliated with the [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lords of Chaos]], or [[Demonology|demon hunters]]. Several years after the [[The New 52|New 52]] reboot, DC Comics introduced its latest and second-longest-running incarnation, '''[[Doctor Fate (Khalid Nassour)|Khalid Nassour]]''', the grandnephew of Kent Nelson chosen by [[ancient Egyptian deities]] and [[archangel]]s.

The Doctor Fate character has appeared in various incarnations across multiple forms of media based on both comic and original characters; The Kent Nelson incarnation has appeared in several media, such as the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', in which he is portrayed by [[Brent Stait]], and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Black Adam (film)|Black Adam]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Pierce Brosnan]]. In animated media, several incarnations of Doctor Fate have appeared in the [[Young Justice (TV series)|''Young Justice'']] animated series; Nabu, Khalid Nassour and Kent Nelson's versions of Doctor Fate have appeared in the animated series alongside other original incarnations based on pre-existing characters such as [[Zatara]], [[Zatanna]], and [[Traci 13]].


==Publication history==

=== Golden Age ===
The first character to debut as Doctor Fate was Kent Nelson, who appeared in his own self-titled six page strip in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #55 (May 1940) during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. The character was created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist Howard Sherman, who produced the first three years of monthly Doctor Fate stories.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=[[L.G.

When the [[Justice Society of America]] was created for ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #3 (Winter 1940), Doctor Fate was one of the characters [[DC Comics#Golden Age|National Comics]] used for the joint venture with [[All-American Publications]]. He made his last appearance in the book in issue #21 (Summer 1944), virtually simultaneously with the end of his own strip in ''More Fun Comics'' #98 (July–August 1944).

=== Silver Age ===
Aside from the annual JSA/JLA team-ups in ''Justice League of America'' that began in 1963, Doctor Fate appeared in other stories through the 1960s and 1970s, including a two-issue run with [[Hourman]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #55–56, two appearances with [[Superman]] in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #201 (March 1971 and #208, December 1971); an appearance with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #156 (November 1979); and a solo story in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #9 (December 1975), written by [[Martin Pasko]] and drawn by [[Walt Simonson]]. Doctor Fate and the rest of The Justice Society returned to ''All-Star Comics'' in 1976 with #58 for a two-year run ending with issue #74 and ''Adventure Comics'' #461-462 in 1978, and ''Adventure Comics'' #466 related the untold tale of the Justice Society's 1951 disbanding. During this period, Inza Cramer's name as such was amended.<ref name="showcase55-562">{{Comic book reference|writer=[[Gardner Fox|Fox, Gardner]]|penciller=[[Murphy Anderson|Anderson, Murphy]]|inker=Anderson, Murphy|story=|title=[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]|volume=|issue=#55–56|date=March/April & May/June, 1965|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|page=|panel=}}</ref>

=== Bronze Age ===
Doctor Fate's origin was retold in ''DC Special Series'' #10, and Doctor Fate again teamed up with Superman in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #23 (July 1980), and featured in a series of back-up stories running in ''The Flash'' from #306 (February 1982) to #313 (September 1982) written by [[Martin Pasko]] (aided by [[Steve Gerber]] from #310 to #313) and drawn by [[Keith Giffen]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Riley |first=Shannon E. |date=May 2013 |title=A Matter of (Dr.) Fate Martin Pasko and Keith Giffen Discuss Their Magical ''Flash'' Backup Series |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=64 |pages=64–68}}</ref>

Beginning in 1981, DC's ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' elaborated upon the adventures of many World War II-era heroes, including Doctor Fate and the JSA. The series ran for 67 issues and three annuals, concluding in 1987. Doctor Fate made occasional modern-day appearances in ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' in 1984, the same year which witnessed the 22nd and final annual Justice Society/Justice League team-up.<ref>''Justice League'' #231-232 (October–November 1984). DC Comics.</ref> Doctor Fate also made a guest appearance in a 3-issue 1985 crossover in the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #19-20 and ''Justice League'' #244. Doctor Fate then appeared in the four-part special ''America vs. the Justice Society'' (1985) which finalized the story of the Justice Society, featuring an elaboration of the events of ''Adventure Comics'' #466 and a recap of the Justice Society's annual team-ups with the Justice League. In 1985, DC collected the Doctor Fate back-up stories from ''The Flash'', a retelling of Doctor Fate's origin by [[Paul Levitz]], [[Joe Staton]], and [[Michael Netzer|Michael Nasser]] originally published in ''Secret Origins of Super-Heroes'' (January 1978) (''DC Special Series'' #10 in the indicia), the Pasko/Simonson Doctor Fate story from ''1st Issue Special'' #9, and a Doctor Fate tale from ''More Fun Comics'' #56 (June 1940), in a three-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''The Immortal Doctor Fate''. Doctor Fate appeared in several issues of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', after which Doctor Fate briefly joined the Justice League.<ref>''Legends'' #6 (April 1987). DC Comics.</ref>

=== Modern Age ===

==== ''Doctor Fate'' series ====
In 1987, ''Doctor Fate'' mini-series was released soon afterward, featuring the debut of Eric and Linda Strauss, who would replace the character Kent Nelson as Doctor Fate after being seemingly killed off by the antagonist of the book.<ref name="Fate19872">''Doctor Fate'' #1–4 (July–October 1987). DC Comics.</ref> Later, DC Comics would release a Doctor Fate ongoing series focusing on both characters acting simultaneously as Doctor Fate, the first twenty-four issues written and drawn by [[J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Shawn McManus]] starting in the winter of 1988. The series focused on magically aged up Eric and Linda acting as Doctor Fate under the guidance of Nabu, whom has inhabited and taken the identity of Kent Nelson. Despite their differences in personality and both Eric's immaturity and true age, Linda is portrayed as having feelings for Erica which are mutual.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #1 (Winter 1988).

In 1991, later issues of the series saw Kent's wife Inza take over as the new Doctor Fate with a different benefactor unlike her husband, starting with the 25th issue of the series Inza's tenure as Doctor Fate differs from Nelson in her focus on [[social class]] issues and inequality, using her powers to improve one of the poorest districts in New York City while defending it from corruption and genuine malevolent evil forces. The series ended with issue #41.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #41 (June 1992). DC Comics.</ref> Following ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', DC killed off both Kent and Inza and replaced them with a new character, Jared Stevens.

===== ''Book of Fate'' series =====
DC eventually replaced the existing Doctor Fate with a new character, Jared Stevens.

The character then starred in ''The Book of Fate'' written by Keith Giffen, which ran from February 1997 to January 1998 for twelve issues as part of DC's "[[Weirdoverse]]" imprint, rebooting the character's origins and adventures. In 1999, the revival of the Justice Society in ''[[Justice Society of America#JSA|JSA]]'' allowed the Doctor Fate character to be re-worked once more and subsequently killed off the Jared Stevens character.<ref name="jsa12">''JSA'' #1 (August 1999).

==== ''Countdown to Mystery''<nowiki/>'s ''Doctor Fate'' & other appearances ====
In 2007, a new incarnation of Doctor Fate, Kent V. Nelson, was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Justiniano]] and serves as an attempt to revitalize the Doctor Fate character. Unlike prior depictions, the character is instead no longer rooted in Egyptian/Mesopotamian mythology and is disassociated with the Lords of Chaos and Order due to being killed off during Infinite Crisis. Gerber also stated his intentions of not directly contradicting previous runs while raising the subject as little as possible. The character was also the grand nephew of the original Doctor Fate, establishing a connection to the most recognized Doctor Fate.<ref name=":03">{{cite web |last=McLauchlin |first=Jim |date=2006-12-03 |title=A Twist of Fate |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002578766.cfm |website=Wizard |access-date=2007-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212102237/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002578766.cfm |archive-date=2007-12-12}}</ref><ref name=":14">{{cite web |date=2007-03-03 |title=Some Thoughts on Doctor Fate – Part 1 |url=http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/?p=283 |url-status=dead |website=stevegerberblog |access-date=2011-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716174624/http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/?p=283 |archive-date=2011-07-16}}</ref> Due to Steve Gerber's death, the seventh issue was written by [[Adam Beechen]] using Gerber's notes.

====DC You & DC Rebirth-onward====
After the conclusion of the ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' limited series in June 2015, DC launched a new ''Doctor Fate'' ongoing series, written by [[Paul Levitz]] and drawn by [[Sonny Liew]] as part of the DC You initiative, which saw an emphasis on "story over continuity", loosening the restrictions of continuity to allow for a diverse range of genres while some characters underwent status quo changes.

In 2018, DC launched a second ''Justice League Dark'' series written by [[James Tynion IV]] starring a new roster led by Wonder Woman. In this roster, Khalid and Kent Nelson were revealed to be eventual new members of the Justice League, originally acting as "advisors" in the team and became reoccurring characters.

In 2021, Khalid Nassour would appear in major storylines such as the Justice League Dark's "The Great Wickedness" storyline, depicting a status quo change in which the Helm of Fate is damaged from a previous battle with the villain, Upside-Down Man, and is inhabited by a new entity.<ref name="DC COMICS">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1269618795 |title=JUSTICE LEAGUE DARK THE GREAT WICKEDNESS. |date=2022 |publisher=DC COMICS |isbn=978-1-77951-551-3 |location=[S.l.] |oclc=1269618795}}</ref> Connected to the [[Future State]] crossover event depicting an older Khalid Nassour having lived through the aftermath of the events of the "Great Wickedness" storyline, the entity is revealed to be the Egyptian goddess, Hauhhet.<ref name="DC COMICS" /> Nassour would also play a role in the ''Justice League''/''Justice League Dark'' crossover involving the return of the character, Xanadoth.

==Incarnations==

=== Kent Nelson ===
[[File:Doctor_Fate_(Kent_Nelson)_Unmasked.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Kent Nelson. Art by Álvaro Martínez Bueno & Raúl Fernández.]]
The first and original incarnation of Doctor Fate, Kent Nelson was created by Gardener Fox and Howard Sherman during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age of Comics Books]]. Known often as the primary and most well-known incarnation of the character, Nelson serves as both the main character and major supporting character to several of the ''Doctor Fate'' titles over the years. 

Born as the son of an archaeologist, Kent was an American of both Swedish and British descent who ventured with his father into a tomb in Mesopotamia, discovering the human body of Nabu but at the cost of his father's life. Nabu would pity the child and train him in the ways of magic before making him Doctor Fate, an agent of the Lords of Order. Kent would begin a superhero career specializing in magic and was a founding member of the All-Star Squadron and Justice Society of America as well as bonded with his partner and eventual wife, Inza Cramer. Later revisions to his history altered his relationship with Nabu, portraying him as a overbearing, controlling figure that manipulated a young Kent Nelson into being his agent while slowly supplanting his free will with his own.<ref name=":2" /> In modern continuity, he is succeeded officially by his grand-nephew and apprentice, Khalid Nassour.

Altered by Nabu, Kent possesses a level of immortality, invulnerability, and telekinetic abilities on his own.  In tandem with Nabu's artifacts, he gains potent spell-casting capabilities and magical powers, making him among the most powerful sorcerers of his time and the most powerful incarnation of Doctor Fate.<ref name=":05">{{Cite book |last=Scott |first=Melanie |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1089398386 |title=DC ultimate character guide |date=2019 |isbn=978-1-4654-7975-4 |edition=New |location=New York, New York |oclc=1089398386}}</ref> He also possesses profound knowledge in the mystic arts, is a certified archaeologist & physician (the latter in some continuities), holding a doctorate degree in both.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Messner-Loebs |first=William |title=Doctor Fate v2 #28 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1991}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Fox |first=Gardner F. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144226065 |title=The golden age Doctor Fate archives.

=== Eric & Linda Strauss ===
[[File:Doctor Fate (Eric-Linda Stauss) 01.jpg|thumb|278x278px|Eric and Linda Strauss as Doctor Fate. Art by Jim Fern.]]

The second incarnation of Doctor Fate, both Eric and Linda Strauss's characters debuted in ''Doctor Fate'' #1 on July 1987.  Created by J.M Dematteis and Keith Giffen, the character were created to replace the original incarnation of Doctor Fate.

Born to wealthy parents Rebecca and Henry Stauss, Eric was selected as a future agent of order, growing up aware of the existence of the Lords of Order and having a level of mystic awareness although it birthed a abnormal personality. He would have a bond with his future partner, Linda Strauss, whom became his step-mother after Rebecca committed suicide on account of the abuse she received from Henry. Soon, Linda herself was subjected to abuse at his hands but endured it for Eric, whom she found herself having a strange fascination with. At the age of ten, Eric was chosen as Nabu's next agent of order to inherit the Doctor Fate mantle, subquentionally aging up the boy in a similar manner to Nelson before although this time, Eric's mind did not mature.<ref name="Fate1987">''Doctor Fate'' #1–4 (July–October 1987)</ref> He would act as Doctor Fate alongside Linda, the two often merging in order to become Doctor Fate.

'''Inza Cramer-Nelson''' (also '''Inza Saunders''') debuted in ''More Fun Comics'' #55 in 1940, created by created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist Howard Sherman. Originally, the character was created as a love interest for Kent Nelson, the original character to have starred as Doctor Fate. She would eventually become the fourth character to bear the Doctor Fate name and the second female character to become Doctor Fate.

In a scheme to lure in Doctor Fate, Inza was kidnapped by the scientific villain, Wotan. Inza and Doctor Fate meet, the woman enamoured with a life potentially filled with adventure and would accompany Doctor Fate as his partner. Eventually, Kent Nelson revealed his identity to her and she would support him when he became a medical doctor, accompanying him as a nurse.

At some point, she also pursued a doctorate in archaeology similarly to her husband.<ref name=":13" />

Later, the two would marry, the magics of the Tower of Fate keeping them young. Overtime, their marriage became strained due to Nabu's influence on Doctor Fate and Inza coming to resent having to be in a passive role within the Tower of Fate, resulting in a loss of a social life. Despite later having some romantic feelings for another man, Inza ultimately remained faithful to Kent with intent on working through their marital problems.<ref name=":13">{{Cite book |last=Pasko |first=Martin |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/920677015 |title=The Immortal Doctor Fate |date=2016 |others=Keith Giffen, Walter Simonson |isbn=978-1-4012-5876-4 |location=Burbank, CA |oclc=920677015}}</ref>

Eventually, Inza and Nelson would be killed in the wake of the cosmic event known as kali yuga, the Lords of Chaos empowered and weakening Nabu, rapidly aging both of them and the strain being too much for Inza to bear. Eventually, Nelson too was killed and in the aftermath, the two would live out their afterlfie within the Amulet of Anubis for a time, the pair creating the life they missed out in their lifetime in the dimension, including a child.

Eventually, the pair are resurrected into younger bodies and Inza becomes the sole Doctor Fate for a time, unable to merge with Nelson. As Doctor Fate, Inza's methods are more proactive although she becomes more reckless in their use, stemming a temporary separation from Kent. The two reconcile their differences upon learning Inza's patron as Doctor Fate originating from a Lord of Chaos, making her an agent of chaos.  The Chaos Lord revealing himself to have subtly influenced some events enough to cause the two to have strife against one another and enjoyed having the Lords of Chaos be a force of good, reasoning that even Chaos Lords did not find evil as favorable. The Chaos Lord would relinquish the powers bestowed to Inza back to himself although she would replace her chaos magic with magics stemming from life and continued acting as Doctor Fate, with Nelson acting alongside her.<ref name="df25">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #25 (February 1991)</ref><ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #26–32 (March 1991–September 1991)</ref> When operating as separate Doctor Fates, Inza wears the helmet and Kent's original costume while Kent wears the half helmet and costume he used in the late 1940s.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #36 (January 1992)</ref> Sometime later, the Nelsons and the JSA face the supervillain [[Hank Hall#Zero Hour: Extant|Extant]] during [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]'s attempt to change the history of the universe.

The character was created as the fifth incarnation of the Doctor Fate character. Unlike other depictions of the character, he is instead referred to as simply '''Fate'''. As opposed to being a traditional sorcerer and spell-caster, he is instead cast similarly to a demon hunter and has the most radical of designs compared to other incarnations of Doctor Fate. This incarnation was considered an unpopular reinvention of the character.<ref name=":6" />

After retiring, the Nelsons hire smuggler Jared Stevens to recover the helmet, amulet, and cloak from an Egyptian tomb. When the Nelsons try to collect the artifacts, they are murdered by two demons. During the battle, Jared attempts to use the amulet as a weapon, which then explodes and imbues him with various magical abilities and a red ankh-shaped scar over his right eye. Jared's injuries force him to use the cloak as a wrap for his right arm and to melt the helmet into a set of ankh-shaped darts and a dagger for use as weapons. After defeating the demons, Jared is contacted by Nabu, who attempts to make Jared the new Doctor Fate. Jared refuses and escapes, becoming a demon hunter using the alias "Fate".

=== Hector Hall ===
[[File:Drfate4.jpg|left|thumb|154x154px|Hector Hall. Art by [[Stephen Sadowski]].]]
Hector Hall first appeared in ''All-Star Squadron'' #25 (September, 1983) as the son of Golden Age heroes [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]], both characters whose stories include [[reincarnation]] as a central part of their fictional history. The character would eventually be reworked into the next incarnation of Doctor Fate in ''JSA'' #33 (October, 1999).

After Jared's murder, the mantle of Doctor Fate, along with a restored helmet, amulet, and cloak, is passed to a reincarnated Hector Hall.<ref name="jsa4">''JSA'' #4 (November 1999)</ref> The Justice Society is reformed to protect the newly reborn Hector, who is being sought by Mordru so that he can use the boy's body to unlock the magical potential of Doctor Fate's artifacts for his own benefit.<ref>''JSA'' #2 (September 1999)</ref> Hector's new body is the biological son of [[Hawk and Dove]] (Hank Hall and Dawn Granger), who are agents of Chaos and Order, respectively, which makes Hector an agent of balance instead of one side or the other.<ref>''JSA'' #46 (May 2003)</ref> When the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] goes on a quest to extinguish magic, he banishes Hector and his [[Fury (DC Comics)#Hippolyta "Lyta" Trevor-Hall|wife]] to a snowy mountain landscape for all eternity, which they are only able to 'escape' by entering the Dream realm, although this essentially kills their bodies and means they can never return to Earth.<ref>{{Comic book reference|writer=[[Keith Champagne|Champagne, Keith]]|penciller=[[Don Kramer|Kramer, Don]]|inker=|story=|title=[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]|volume=|issue=#79–80|date=January and February 2006 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]|page=|panel=}}</ref>

Like other Doctor Fates, Hector's possession of the Nabu's mystical artifacts makes him among the most powerful sorcerers in the [[DC Universe]]. Unlike incarnations preceding him, Hector retains his agency even with Nabu inhabiting the helm and doesn't require the use of ankhs when using his magical abilities and is stated to potentially be the most powerful incarnations of all incarnations of Doctor Fate before him.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geoff Johns |first=Geoff |title=Hawkman Secret Files and Origins #1 |last2=Beard |first2=Jim |publisher=DC Comics |year=2002}}</ref>

=== Kent V. Nelson ===

The latest incarnation of Doctor Fate prior to the [[The New 52|New 52 reboot]], the character debuted in the first issue of ''Countdown to Mystery'' in 2007 as an attempt to revitalize the character; unlike other Doctor Fates, the character lacks any connections to Nabu and either of the Lords of Order or Lords of Chaos, as the two factions were killed off in a previous storyline. In addition, the character's powers is not tied to any known mythology, making the Doctor Fate character exclusively a mystic superhero.<ref name=":03" /><ref name=":14" />

A [[psychiatrist]] and the grand-nephew of Kent Nelson, the character would lose his status following his infidelity leading to a divorce, leading to depression and losing his license following negligent practices in the workplace. Eventually, the Helm of Fate, seeking a new host, would choose him as the next incarnation of Doctor Fate. The character would become a member of the Justice Society of America, struggling with upholding the legacy of spell-casters with his initial lack of magical expertise.<ref name="mystery">''Countdown to Mystery'' #1–8 (November 2007–July 2008)</ref><ref name=":22">''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #35 (March 2010)</ref>

The newest and current incarnation of Doctor Fate, Khalid first appeared in June 2015, starring in a ''Doctor Fate'' solo series, created as another attempt to revilize the character, this time using the Egyptian-related background of the character.<ref name="newsarama14" /> The character's journey & world would be inspired by [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Spider-Man]] and [[Doctor Strange]]<ref name="newsarama14" /> and is notably one of DC Comics's first [[Muslims|Muslim]] characters to headline a solo series.<ref name=":52">{{cite web |last1=Plummer |first1=Jessica |date=19 March 2020 |title=Give This Hero a Comic Book: Khalid Nassour (Doctor Fate) |url=https://bookriot.com/2020/03/19/khalid-nassour-doctor-fate-comic/ |access-date=3 April 2020 |website=Book Riot}}</ref> Unlike the other incarnations, the character's designation as Doctor Fate comes from both a cultural connection to [[Ancient Egyptian deities|Egyptian deities]] and a religious connection to [[Archangel]]s instead of Nabu.<ref name=":12" />

== Powers, abilities, and resources ==
With access to various magical artifacts, all incarnations of Doctor Fate (albiet Jared Stevens due to the nature of his powers & non-spell casting abilities) possess sufficient magical power that allows them to be considered to be among the most powerful magical users on Earth in the DC Universe, with the character being said to possess numerous magical abilities considered nearly unstoppable.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Scott |first=Melanie |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1089398386 |title=DC ultimate character guide |date=2019 |isbn=978-1-4654-7975-4 |edition=New |location=New York, New York |oclc=1089398386}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> These abilities include spell-casting, flight, teleportation, invisibility, necromancy, etc.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":0" /> Some versions of Doctor Fate also possess the ability to mystically merge both body and souls with another also selected to be Doctor Fate, creating a magical being that calls themselves Dr. Fate and access a greater level of power.<ref name=":9" /> 

=== Mystic artifacts ===
==== Helmet of Fate ====
The Helmet of Fate (sometimes called the '''Helm of Fate''', '''Helmet of Anubis''', '''Helmet of Thoth''', or '''Helm of Thoth''') is a magical [[Corinthian helmet|corinthian]] helmet that grants the bearer godly level powers and is considered one of the most powerful magical artifacts in the [[DC Universe]]. While most continuities establish it to be a creation of [[Nabu (comics)|Nabu]], the fourth ''Doctor Fate'' series presents a different origin, the helm instead associated with [[Thoth]] and is presented with an altered origin, the object of power being rooted in the DC's version of Egyptian mythology; being a creation of [[Osiris]] and Thoth's hand, it was created in order to trap Nabu, who once served alongside Thoth for reasons not revealed.<ref name=":12" /> Acting as a respository of  magical energy, the helm was constructed using the fictitious metal known as Nth metal, granting it mystical properties as well as some anti-magic properties against those of magical origin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Snyder |first=Scott |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1061866233 |title=Dark nights : metal |date=2019 |others=Greg Capullo, Jonathan Glapion, Fco Plascencia, Mikel Janín, Jorge Jiménez, Doug Mahnke |isbn=978-1-4012-8858-7 |location=Burbank, CA |oclc=1061866233}}</ref> Bearing the helm allows for magical capabilitiy (spell-casting) and grant its users numerous powers: flight, healing, and the manipulation of the natural elements (wind, earth, water, fire, and lightning).<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last1=Manning |first1=Matthew K. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1253363543 |title=The DC comics encyclopedia : the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe |last2=Wiacek |first2=Stephen |last3=Scott |first3=Melanie |last4=Jones |first4=Nick |last5=Walker |first5=Landry Q. |last6=Cowsill |first6=Alan |publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK Publishing]] |year=2021 |isbn=978-0-7440-2056-4 |edition=New |location=New York, New York |language=en |oclc=1253363543}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The helm also contains a vast library of spells in which the user can draw from,<ref name=":11" />  possesses the power to trap entities within its separate world,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tynion |first=James, IV |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1089196038 |title=Justice League Dark.

However, the Helm of Fate is not completely impervious, as powerful entities (i.e. [[Arion (character)|Arion]], [[Brimstone (DC Comics)|Brimstone]]) have shown the ability to damage the helm itself enough to require regeneration, showcasing a vulnerability to powerful forms of magic and applications from the Firestorm matrix.<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":15" /> The helm can also be overload with magical power, rendering much of its power inert; this took place during the ''A Costly Trick of Magic'' storyline when Nabu and Nelson sacrificed themselves to creating a spell powerful enough to injure Upside-Down Man, leaving Khalid's incarnation of Doctor Fate unable to call upon its powers.<ref name=":18" />

==== Amulet of Anubis ====
The '''Amulet of Anubis''' (sometimes called the '''Amulet of Nabu''' or the '''Amulet of Thoth''') is an [[amulet]] that was once bestowed to Anubis's most devout follower, being created by the death god himself. The amulet itself is automatically granted to those who bear the Helm of Fate, bestowed to them alongside the magical cloak. The amulet affords several abilities, including resistance to psychic/astral probing, allows for mind control, and bolsters a user's magical power.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Pasko |first=Martin |title=1st Issue Special #9 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1975}}</ref> While seldomly used by Doctor Fate himself, the amulet also allows for the wearer to call upon the decease spirits, allowing him to commune with spirits<ref>{{Cite book |last=Joyner |first=Tom |title=Doctor Fate (vol. 2) #38 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1992}}</ref> as well as houses its own universe  separate from the main universe, allowing the wearer to hide their existence or to trap powerful entities within.

The amulet's history was revised several times; in one story, the Amulet of Anubis was a powerful artifact forged by the Lords of Order at the dawn of time, being so powerful the Lords of Chaos formerly sought the artifact themselves. Eventually, it came into Nabu's possession to be granted to his chosen agent.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pasko |first=Martin |title=The Flash #306 / Immortal Doctor Fate #2 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1981}}</ref>

==== Other artifacts ====

* '''Cloak of Destiny''': A magical cloak with mystic properities; the cloak is both fireproof<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fox |first=Garnder |title=More Fun Comics #57 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1940}}</ref> and highly resistant towards some forms of magic in the [[DC Universe]]; Jared Stevens notably used it to suppress the chaos magic that infected his arm.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Giffen |first=Keith |title=The Book of Fate #3 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1997}}</ref>

Despite its naming and Doctor Fate's association with magic, it is one of the few devices he uses not explicitly magic; the crystals that make up the orb are considered radio sensitive and react to his brain when in use. Though technological in nature, Doctor Fate often uses it and his magic in order to discern what is being hidden from them.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fox |first=Gardner F. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144226065 |title=The golden age Doctor Fate archives.

=== Tower of Fate ===
The '''Tower of Fate''' (also called the '''Fortress of Fate''') is the magical dwelling bestowed to bearers of the Doctor Fate mantle. The tower acts as a nexus point of magic and reality on Earth. It has no doors or windows, being only accessible by magic. The inside of the tower appears as a twisted maze of stairways and hallways in which the laws of physics do not apply.<ref name=":1" /> The Tower holds a large collection of arcane texts within its personal library, including materials saved from the Great Library of Alexandria prior to its burning. In addition, the Tower itself possess mystical defenses, including once having a protector in the form of Typhon, a Lord of Chaos who was an enemy of Doctor Fate and later protectred the Tower from intruders.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goyer |first=David S. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51448984 |title=JLA, JSA : virtue and vice |date=2002 |others=Geoff Johns, Jesús Merino, Carlos Pacheco |isbn=1-56389-937-X |location=New York |oclc=51448984}}</ref>

=== Patrons ===
Throughout the character's history, several beings have acted as Doctor Fate's patron, granting the character formidable powers: 
{| class="wikitable"

! style="width:35%;" |Description
! colspan="2" |Lords of Order
While inhabiting the Helm of Fate, Nabu's patronage allows for the bearer to have potential access to all of his knowledge, magical energy and power, and can assist his bearers with his insight and thoughts, with his role having been once compared to an AI. However, this leaves a host vulnerable to Nabu, who can also usurp control of his bearer's will and body by force.
! colspan="2" |Egyptian deities
! colspan="2" |Lords of Chaos

=== Weaknesses ===
Despite the character's portrayal of powers, Doctor Fate has several weaknesses dependent on the incarnation:

* Removal the Helm of Fate on Doctor Fate can remove their powers or limit their abilities severely;<ref name=":11" /> several incarnations of Doctor Fate suffer from this weakness, including both the original Kent Nelson (whom can only cast a limited amount of spells alone and possess no power to channel magic without a Lord of Order patron)<ref>{{Cite book |last=Messner-Loebs |first=William |title=Doctor Fate v2 #36 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1992}}</ref> and his grand-nephew, Kent V. Nelson.<ref name=":11" />
* Due to the "rules of magic", Doctor Fate is unable to cast counter spells against himself to nullify another spell after they've been cast, the character only able to use his powers to protect him from the effects of whatever spell has been cast afterwards. This limitation is present on Kent Nelson's incarnation of Doctor Fate.<ref name=":2" /><ref>''Justice League of America'' #38 (September 1965)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' #148 (November 1977)</ref>
* The Kent Nelson incarnation of Doctor Fate has also fallen victim to gas attacks and lack of oxygen without magical protections.
* Divine sources can also disrupt the abilities bestowed to Doctor Fate's incarnations, namely their healing abilities. This weakness has been seen with Khalid Nassour's incarnation of Doctor Fate<ref name=":12" />

=== Khalid Ben-Hassin ===
[[File:Doctor_Fate_(Ben-Hassin)_in_Earth_2_11_Textless_Cover.png|thumb|left|120px|'''Khalid Ben-Hassin''' as Doctor Fate. Art by [[Brett Booth]]]]
*Through the Helm of Fate, has mastery of magic by invoking Egyptian deities within his spells.|alias=Doctor Fate<br>Dr. Fate|name=Khalid Ben-Hassin|teams=Wonders of the World<br>[[Lords of Chaos and Order]]|debutyr=2013}}In 2013 several years after DC Comics rebooted the [[DC Universe]] through the New 52, a new incarnation of Doctor Fate would be created for the ''Earth 2'' series. Similarly to the Khalid Nassour incarnation (whom debuted 2 years after Ben-Hassin), the character is also of Egyptian descent raised in America. The character's descent was intentional by James Robinson, wanting an Egyptian character to hold the mantle Doctor Fate while still allowing to be Western but not making him a caricature. Unlike other versions of Fate prior to 2013, his spell-craft abilities are also centered on invoking Egyptian deities. Alongside his creation also came a redesign of the Doctor Fate enemy, [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=TODAY |first=Brian Truitt, USA |title='Earth 2' writer puts a new twist on Doctor Fate |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/03/04/earth-2-comic-book-series/1962607/ |access-date=2022-05-23 |website=USA Today |language=en-US}}</ref>

Ben-Hassin was raised by Kent Neslon, whom served as his [[legal guardian]] and studied [[archaeology]], specializing in knowledge of the occult and later earning a [[doctorate]].<ref name=":7">{{Cite book |last=Robinson |first=James Dale |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1014309415 |title=Earth 2.

First appearing in "''The Tower of Fate''" storyline, it is revealed that two years prior, Khalid and [[Hawkgirl (Kendra Saunders)|Kendra Saunders-Munoz]]  were sent to uncover the Tomb of Nabu, the dwelling of a powerful mage, by the World Army, the ordeal in which gave Kendra her wings and revealed Khalid as being Nabu's chosen vessel. Instead of accepting its power, Khalid sent the Helm away with the remnant of power he gained after bearing the Helm for a brief time. Hesitant on accepting himself as Nabu's vessel since, he is later coerced when Wotan kidnaps him, Jay Garrick (Flash), and Jay's mother in order to force Khalid to retrieve the Helm within the Tower of Fate, which cannot be accessed by anyone else other than himself and those in his proximity. Inspired by Flash's heroism and bravery, he chooses to become Nabu's agent of order and chaos, christening himself "Doctor Fate". He battles Wotan and eventually prevails with the help of Nabu's deceased spirit and using his knowledge of Egyptian deities to banish Wotan.<ref name=":7" />

=== Doctor Fate (Legion of Super-Heroes) ===
A future version of the character debuted in ''Supergirl'' #33 (2019), first created by writer Marc Andreyako and artist Kevin Maguire. This version of the character is a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], appearing in a possible future in the 31st century after the alterations of reality made by [[Doctor Manhattan]] was undone during the [[Doomsday Clock (comics)|''Doomsday Clock'']] event.

Unlike other versions of Doctor Fate, the Legion of Super-Heroes's Doctor Fate is portrayed as a six-armed, male alien sorcerer. Doctor Fate asssits the Legion of Super-Heroes in mystic matters and is the one who warns the Legion and the United Planets of the coming Great Darkness, the true source and emobodiment of darkness in the DC Universe.  He also assists the Legion of Super-Heroes in defeating the future version of [[Mordru]], who plots to kill [[Jon Kent (DC Comics)|Superman (Jon Kent)]] with help from Rogol Zaar.

=== Alternate versions of  incarnations ===

==== ''Books of Magic'' ====
While [[Timothy Hunter]] is being guided through the world of magic by the [[Phantom Stranger]], the two of them observe Kent, though he is unaware of their presence.<ref>''The Books of Magic'' #1 (March 1991)</ref> Sometime later, [[Mister E]] shows Hunter a future version of the helmet that resembles a human skull and kills any of its worshippers who wear it. The helmet has given up on life itself and the war between Order and Chaos. Mister E revealed that in the past, he attempted to kill Doctor Fate and destroy the helmet but was stopped by the Justice League.<ref>''The Books of Magic'' #4 (June 1991)</ref>

==== Kingdom Come ====
The ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' universe features a version of Nabu who is able to channel his consciousness through the helmet and cloak without the need for a host body. This version of Fate sides with Batman's group and is among the survivors at the end of the final battle.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #1–4 (May–August 1996)</ref>

In the Earth-1 universe, Professor Lewis Lang and his assistant Burt Belker discover a helmet in the Valley of Ur in Mesopotamia that is identical to the helmet on Earth-2 except for its blue color. This helmet contains a Lord of Chaos that possesses Burt and turns him into the sorcerer Doctor Chaos, whose costume is identical to Doctor Fate's except for a reversed color scheme. [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] confronts Doctor Chaos and removes the helmet from Burt, jettisoning it into space.<ref>''The New Adventures of Superboy'' #25 (January 1982)</ref>

A new version of Doctor Chaos later appeared briefly in the ''[[Justice League of America]]'' 2018 series within the main [[DC Universe|DC Comics Universe]]. This version is aligned with the Lords of Chaos outfitted in garb similar to Doctor Fate except for a reverse color scheme much like the Earth-1 version. Acting as a protector of the Lords of Chaos's base of operations, the Chaos Realm, he appears when the Justice League's mystical villain, Queen of Fables, attempts to escape her imprisonment. He is swiftly killed by the Queen of Fables and escapes the Chaos Realm. The identity of the person behind Doctor Chaos remains unknown.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Orlando |first=Steve |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1014090846 |title=Justice League of America.

** Kent Nelson (voiced by [[Edward Asner]]) is a retired member of the [[Justice Society of America]] and mentor to [[Zatara|Giovanni Zatara]] who ceased being Nabu's host due to its effects on Nelson's marriage.
