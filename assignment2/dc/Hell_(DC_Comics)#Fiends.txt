It is the locational [[antithesis]] of the Silver City in [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]]. The DC Comics location known as Hell is based heavily on its depiction in [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic mythology]]. Although several versions of Hell had briefly appeared before in various other DC Comics publications in the past, the official DC Comics concept of Hell was first properly established when it was mentioned in &#39;&#39;The Saga of the [[Swamp Thing (comic book)#Alan Moore|Swamp Thing]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #25\u201327 (June\u2013August 1984) and was first seen in &#39;&#39;Swamp Thing Annual&#39;&#39; #2 (1985), all of which were written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Stephen R. Bissette|Stephen Bissette]] and [[John Totleben]].\n\nThe [[hierarchy]] of Hell, specifically the triumvirate of  [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]], [[Azazel (DC Comics)|Azazel]], and [[Beelzebub]], was first referred to in &#39;&#39;[[Hellblazer|John Constantine, Hellblazer]]&#39;&#39; #12 (December 1988) (\&quot;The Devil You Know...\&quot; (page 6) by [[Jamie Delano]] and [[Richard Piers Rayner]]) and first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #4 (April 1989) (\&quot;A Hope in Hell\&quot; by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Sam Kieth]]); in the story, Lucifer had been forced to accept the position of the ruler of Hell due to the disruption caused by the Great Evil Beast&#39;s attack on Creation during the &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; in the 16-part storyline \&quot;American Gothic\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Swamp Thing&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #35\u201350 (April 1985\u2013July 1986). &#39;&#39;John Constantine, Hellblazer,&#39;&#39; would also later add in the [[First of the Fallen]], who preceded Lucifer and his failed rebellion in Heaven. In &#39;&#39;[[Who&#39;s Who in the DC Universe#Who&#39;s Who in the DC Universe|Who&#39;s Who in the DC Universe]]&#39;&#39; #11 (July 1991), the entry on \&quot;Hell&#39;s Hierarchy\&quot; included all the elements of Gaiman&#39;s version, plus John Constantine the Hellblazer&#39;s demonic enemy Nergal, Agony and Ecstasy the Slave-Twins of the Inquisition,&lt;ref&gt;First seen in &#39;&#39;John Constantine, Hellblazer&#39;&#39; #12 (December 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; Asteroth,&lt;ref&gt;First seen behind the scenes in &#39;&#39;The Demon&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1\u20134 (January\u2013April 1987) and then fully in &#39;&#39;Action Comics Weekly&#39;&#39; #636\u2013641 (the second story in each of the first five issues) (January 24\u2013March 7, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Abaddon the Destroyer, Morax and [[Superman]]&#39;s demonic enemy Blaze, who, along with her brother Satanus, came to rule Hell in the eight-issue [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] &#39;&#39;[[Reign in Hell]]&#39;&#39; (September 2008\u2013April 2009, also including &#39;&#39;DC Universe Special: Reign in Hell&#39;&#39; #1 (August 2008)).\n\n==Publication history==\nBecause of the multiplicity of imprints and acquisitions under the DC Comics umbrella, there have been many different versions of \&quot;Satan\&quot; and \&quot;Hell\&quot;.\n\nAt [[Quality Comics]] in 1942, the superhero known as [[Midnight (DC Comics)|Midnight]] encountered the Devil and his domineering Wife after his untimely death.&lt;ref&gt;This incident occurred in &#39;&#39;Smash Comics&#39;&#39; #36 (October 1942).&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Fawcett Comics]] in 1942, [[Ibis the Invincible#Prince Amentep|Ibis the Invincible]] I (Prince Amentep) confronted a demonic entity who inexplicably named itself \&quot;Satan\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;This incident occurred in &#39;&#39;Whiz Comics&#39;&#39; #27 (February 1942).&lt;/ref&gt; At [[DC Comics]], the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #60 (January\u2013February 1966) featured the first appearance of Azmodus and &#39;&#39;[[Justice League of America]]&#39;&#39; #49 (November 1966) introduced the demon Abaddon, who possessed a farmer named Hiram Spiezel. DC Comics&#39; interpretation of [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]] debuted in a dream sequence in &#39;&#39;[[Superman&#39;s Pal Jimmy Olsen]]&#39;&#39; #65 (December 1962). Lucifer was introduced for real in &#39;&#39;[[DC Special Series]]&#39;&#39; #8 (1978), a.k.a. &#39;&#39;[[The Brave and the Bold]] Special&#39;&#39;, which teamed up the [[Batman]] I (Bruce Wayne), [[Sgt. Rock|Sgt. Franklin John \&quot;Frank\&quot; Rock]] and [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] and depicted Lucifer being summoned by the ghosts of [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Nero]] and [[Bluebeard]] and controlling a human operative named Edward Dirkes. Jason Blood had a nightmare about Hell in [[Jack Kirby]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;The Demon&#39;&#39; #14 (November 1973), but otherwise, the concept was in absentia other than through [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]. Etrigan the Demon debuted in the first issue of the 16-issue Jack Kirby series &#39;&#39;The Demon&#39;&#39; (August\u2013September 1972\u2013January 1974), but Hell was never actually mentioned, seen or shown in a concrete manner in any of the original &#39;&#39;Demon&#39;&#39; stories until &#39;&#39;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #25\u201327 (June\u2013August 1984), in which [[Alan Moore]] made the first canonical claim for Etrigan the Demon being a denizen of Hell, referring to his promotion to a Rhyming Demon and having him speak consistently in rhyme, which he did &#39;&#39;not&#39;&#39; do at all during the Kirby series. Many stories in DC&#39;s various mystery and horror anthology titles featured \&quot;Satan\&quot; and at least one, in &#39;&#39;[[Weird Mystery Tales]]&#39;&#39; #4 (January\u2013February 1973), featured Lucifer, but these stories may or may not be in mainstream DC Universe continuity at all. Satan did appear, along with an angelic pre-Fall Etrigan the Demon, in one of the four possible origins of the Phantom Stranger (three of which are [[Judeo-Christianity|Judeo-Christian]] inspired, the fourth, [[science fiction]] inspired) in &#39;&#39;[[Secret Origins]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #10 (January 1987).\n\nAside from the above-mentioned stories, Hell made its actual first appearance in &#39;&#39;Swamp Thing Annual&#39;&#39; #2 (1985). Subsequently, it would appear again in &#39;&#39;Swamp Thing&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #49\u201350 (June\u2013July 1986), in which there is a civil war going on in Hell and Etrigan the Demon is there. The [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]&#39;s ([[Jim Corrigan#Jim Corrigan (1940s)|James Brendan \&quot;Jim\&quot; Corrigan]] I) failure in his intervention in this conflict leads to a reduction of his powers, as described in &#39;&#39;The Spectre&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1 (April 1987). While Hell appeared in the 31 issues (and one &#39;&#39;Annual&#39;&#39; (1988)) of that series (April 1987\u2013November 1989), readers never saw any major developments outside of characters being condemned to go there and the occasional demon or demons tormenting them, such as in &#39;&#39;The Spectre&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #21 (December 1988). Hell also appeared in the 31 issues (and one &#39;&#39;Annual&#39;&#39; (1985)) of &#39;&#39;[[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]]&#39;&#39; (June 1984\u2013December 1986; also including a special insert in the center of &#39;&#39;The Fury of [[Firestorm (character)|Firestorm]] the Nuclear Man&#39;&#39; #24 (June 1984), which started the series). In &#39;&#39;[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #4 (April 1989), the rulers of Hell are introduced, a triumvirate consisting of Lucifer, a fallen angel deliberately drawn to resemble [[David Bowie]], Azazel, a shadowy, many-eyed former [[Jinn|djinn]] (\&quot;genie\&quot;) (Azazel had previously appeared as an [[incubus]] in a Madame Xanadu story that was first published in &#39;&#39;[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]&#39;&#39; #1 (summer 1978) and then was officially published in &#39;&#39;[[The Unexpected (1968 comic book)|The Unexpected]]&#39;&#39; #190 (March\u2013April 1978)) and Beelzebub, a high-ranking demon resembling a large [[fly]]. This triumvirate (albeit with Beelzebub referred to as Belial; possibly a continuity error) returned in &#39;&#39;[[Secret Origins]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #48 (April 1990), presenting the never-before-told origin of [[Stanley and His Monster|Stanley and his Monster]], in which Lucifer banishes a minor demon from Hell to Earth for being \&quot;too nice\&quot; for Hell, where he is discovered by Stanley Dover Junior, who names him Spot. This version of Hell is also depicted in the 58 issues (plus two &#39;&#39;Annual&#39;&#39;s (1992 and 1993) and one #0 issue (October 1994)) of &#39;&#39;The Demon&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) (July 1980\u2013May 1995), the four-issue miniseries &#39;&#39;[[The Books of Magic]]&#39;&#39; (December 1990\u2013March 1991) and the three-issue miniseries &#39;&#39;[[Kid Eternity#Modern incarnation|Kid Eternity]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) (May\u2013October 1991) by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Duncan Fegredo]].\n\nIn &#39;&#39;Swamp Thing Annual&#39;&#39; #2, Hell was said to be a place that mortal beings went to only because they truly &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;believed&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; that they belonged there. During the fourth &#39;&#39;Sandman&#39;&#39; story arc, &#39;&#39;[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]&#39;&#39;, in &#39;&#39;The Sandman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #21\u201328 (January\u2013July 1991), Lucifer decides to abdicate the throne of Hell and forces all of these beings to leave. He closes the gates of Hell behind him, locks them and gives the key to [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] of the [[Endless (comics)|Endless]], who does not want it, and many divine beings, such as [[List of The Sandman characters#Odin|Odin]], [[List of The Sandman characters#Bast|Bast]] and [[Lords of Chaos and Order#Members|Shivering Jemmy of the Shallow Brigade]], a [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lord of Chaos]], attempt to persuade him to give the key to them. Odin attempts to bribe Dream with the Twilight Dimension of [[Ragnarok]] from &#39;&#39;Last Days of the [[Justice Society of America]] Special&#39;&#39; #1 (1986), specifically because it contains his successor&#39;s grandfather, [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] I (Carter Hall (a.k.a. Prince Khufu Kha-Tarr)) and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Sandman]] I (Wesley Bernard \&quot;Wes\&quot; Dodds),&lt;ref&gt;This incident occurred in &#39;&#39;The Sandman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #26 (May 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; but this attempt fails, as do &#39;&#39;all&#39;&#39; of the others. Eventually, Dream gives the key to the angels [[List of The Sandman characters#Remiel|Remiel]] and [[Duma (DC Comics)|Duma]], who, having been denied re-entry into the Silver City, reinstate Hell as a place of spiritual rehabilitation rather than eternal punishment.

DC Comics&#39; Hell is a debased reflection of Earth, meaning that as Earth became more technologically or socially advanced so did Hell, due to an effect not unlike [[time dilation]]: \&quot;[a] day in Hell is equal to a minute&#39;s passage on Earth\&quot;. All denizens of the mainstream DC Comics version of Hell are capable of using some form of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]]; the most powerful infernal magic users are the ruling gentry of Hell and their enforcers the Necro-Mages, Forges, Exegesis Guild, Renderers, Howlers, Incendiaries, Rhyming Demons and Wishweavers. Every building, weapon, piece of furniture, piece of armor, article of clothing, serving of food, etc. in Hell is made from the bodies of the damned. The damned are put through a process called rendering by the Exegesis Guild and their servants the Renderers in order to manufacture the raw materials of Hell.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Hell&#39; 2008\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Reign in Hell&#39;&#39; #1 (September 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Fictional history===\n====&#39;&#39;Underworld Unleashed&#39;&#39;====\n{{main|Underworld Unleashed}}\nDuring the &#39;&#39;Underworld Unleashed&#39;&#39; crossover event, Neron appeared in the mainstream DC Universe for the first time and established himself as the ruler of Hell, a position that he held for many years.\n\nHe then devised an elaborate scheme to conquer Earth and to gain a \&quot;pure soul\&quot; that he could corrupt, which ultimately involved many of the DC Universe&#39;s [[supervillain]]s and a number of the DC Universe&#39;s [[superhero]]es. Neron offered both groups numerous deals in order to give them their greatest desires in exchange for their souls or for completing a task for him. The scheme was ultimately defeated by the combined efforts of both [[Justice League International#Expansion|Justice League America]] and the [[Trickster (comics)#Fictional character biography|Trickster]] I (Giovanni Giuseppe a.k.a.

He used the Spectre&#39;s powers to extinguish the hellfire font, causing Hell to freeze over. A team of superheroes, including Superman, Zatanna Zatara, [[Sebastian Faust]], [[Firestorm (comics)#Fire Elemental|Firestorm the Nuclear Man]] II (Ronald Roy \&quot;Ronnie\&quot; Raymond), the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] II (Raymond \&quot;Ray\&quot; Palmer), the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)#Day of Judgement|Enchantress]] and [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], were sent deep into Hell&#39;s depths in order to reignite the hellfire font. The reignition required an act of true evil, so Sebastian Faust took matters into his own hands and killed the Enchantress by slitting her throat, thereby damning himself to Hell and thus satisfying the infernal conditions.\n\nThe crossover storyline ended with a three-way battle between Neron, Asmodel and the then-deceased [[Hal Jordan|Harold \&quot;Hal\&quot; Jordan]] (the former [[Green Lantern]] II) for control over the Spectre-Force (which ultimately chose Hal Jordan, thus making &#39;&#39;him&#39;&#39; the Spectre for a time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/DoJ/DoJ.php |title=The Unofficial Day of Judgment Index |access-date=2009-03-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903163136/http://www.dcuguide.com/DoJ/DoJ.php |archive-date=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====&#39;&#39;Reign in Hell&#39;&#39;====\n{{main|Reign in Hell}}\nDuring the events of the &#39;&#39;Reign in Hell&#39;&#39; miniseries, Hell is thrown into a massive conflict as Neron and his generals are confronted with a rebellion led by Blaze and Satanus, the rulers of Purgatory. Neron soon discovered that the rebel demons were offering the damned \&quot;hope to the hopeless\&quot; and redemption for them, which had &#39;&#39;never&#39;&#39; happened before, and that this was a powerful spur. Realizing what would happen if the damned ever rose up against him, Neron has his consort Lilith, the \&quot;mother of all Earthborn fiends\&quot;, summon all of the [[vampire]]s,  [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[ghoul]]s and infernally powered humans to Hell to fight on his side.\n\nThis unrest in the infernal realms attracts the attention of Earth&#39;s magical superheroes, who are concerned about the outcome and the possible repercussions of the war. Many of them descend into Hell and take sides in the conflict (all for reasons of their own), including [[Zatara#Death|Giovanni \&quot;John\&quot; Zatara]],&lt;ref&gt;Zatara was the only one of the magical superheroes involved in this story who was already dead and his soul damned to Hell (where he was part of a general resistance movement that was operating there at the time).

In the miniseries&#39; backup story, [[Doctor Occult|Doctor Richard Occult]], aided by the [[Yellow Peri]], also descends into Hell, but separately from the others and with his &#39;&#39;own&#39;&#39; ulterior motive - to free the soul of his beloved, [[Rose Psychic]], from damnation.&lt;ref&gt;This backup story is told in &#39;&#39;Reign in Hell&#39;&#39; #1\u20137 (September 2008\u2013March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Lobo (DC Comics)#Fictional character biography|Lobo]], who, at this time, is confined to the Labyrinth, Hell&#39;s only prison (due to the deal that he had earlier made with Neron in the &#39;&#39;Underworld Unleashed&#39;&#39; crossover event)&lt;ref&gt;This incident occurred in &#39;&#39;Lobo&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #22 (December 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and whose suffering alone is enough to power Neron&#39;s entire palace, is freed from his torment as a result of the titanic battle between Etrigan the Demon and Blue Devil, a battle which results in Etrigan the Demon&#39;s (temporary) death at Blue Devil&#39;s hands.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Reign in Hell&#39;&#39; #2\u20135 (October 2008\u2013January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo then tears apart the soul of Zatara, which forces Zatanna to destroy his soul and banish it to the Abyss (a place that even Hell cannot touch) at his request, rather than to consign him to an eternity of pain and torment&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Reign in Hell&#39;&#39; #5 (January 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;(later, in the 16-issue miniseries &#39;&#39;Zatanna&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) (July 2010\u2013October 2011), Zatara&#39;s soul is shown to have been saved from destruction by a demon who owes him a favor).\n\nDespite all of this and &#39;&#39;just&#39;&#39; when Neron seems to be victorious, Satanus finally reveals that he used the war as a cover in order to spread a modified viral version of DMN, the anagogic drug that changes humans into monsters and that he had used once before in order to destabilize [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and confound Superman.&lt;ref&gt;This incident, which was titled \&quot;The Blaze/Satanus War\&quot;, occurred in &#39;&#39;The Adventurs of Superman&#39;&#39; #493 (August 1992) (1992: 31), &#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #680 (August 1992) (1992: 32), &#39;&#39;Superman: The Man of Steel&#39;&#39; #15 (September 1992) (1992: 33) and &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #71 (September 1992) (1992: 34) (the years and numbers mentioned here are on the covers of the issues).&lt;/ref&gt; This variation of DMN is airborne and, when combined with the speaking of the magic word \&quot;[[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]]\&quot;, it transforms Neron and all of Hell&#39;s demons into soulless humans, all except Lilith, who was &#39;&#39;not&#39;&#39; a true demon. It also causes all of the demonic entities that Neron had consumed over the millennia to be cast out of him.

All of the rulers of the Provinces bowed down to Neron, then to Satanus when he took the throne of Hell from Neron and then to Blaze when she did the same thing to Satanus. The Nine Provinces included Pandemonia, the Odium, the Gull, Praetori, Internecia, Ament, the Labyrinth, Err and Purgatory (&#39;&#39;below, there are descriptions of the Nine Provinces of the Infernal Dominion as depicted in the miniseries&#39;&#39;).&lt;ref name=\&quot;Hell&#39; 2009\&quot;/&gt;\n\n*&#39;&#39;&#39;Pandemonia&#39;&#39;&#39; - The First Province, home of Hell&#39;s high-caste demons and the location of the throne of Hell, the seat of the Dominus or Domina.\n*&#39;&#39;&#39;The Odium&#39;&#39;&#39; - The Second Province, the industrial and [[manufacturing]] center.

Artemis was, by right, next in line to rule her former husband&#39;s realm, but instead she had the other 12 Princes of Hell grant Belyllioth her station instead.&lt;ref&gt;This story is told in &#39;&#39;Artemis: Requiem&#39;&#39; #1\u20136 (June\u2013November 1996) and &#39;&#39;Wonder Woman Annual&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #6 (second story) (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Notable in this depiction were the [[Myrmidons]], a race of savage ant-like demons that were faithful to Belyllioth.&lt;ref&gt;First seen in &#39;&#39;Artemis: Requiem&#39;&#39; #1 (June 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Vertigo==\n===Description===\n{{see also|Lucifer (DC Comics)}}\nThe [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint of DC Comics also has its own version of Hell, with its own very specific infernal sovereignty formerly ruled by [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer Samael Morningstar]].\n\n===Fictional history===\nContrary to popular belief, the term &#39;&#39;&#39;Satan&#39;&#39;&#39; (a Hebrew word meaning \&quot;adversary\&quot;) represents a title within the legions of Hell and is &#39;&#39;not&#39;&#39; an actual name. The most well-known Satan is Lucifer Samael Morningstar, whose rule supplanted both that of the First of the Fallen and the First Triumvirate and Etrigan the Demon and the Second Triumvirate. Lucifer was the fourth fallen angel and yet &#39;&#39;not&#39;&#39; the first ruler of Hell, though he later became the ruler of Hell for many centuries. When the Great Evil Beast threatened all of existence by making an attack on Creation during the &#39;&#39;Crisis on Infinite Earths&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref&gt;These two incidents both occurred together in the DC Comics maxiseries &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; #1\u201312 (April 1985\u2013March 1986; the spine of a major DC Comics [[Crossover (fiction)#Comics|crossover event]]) and in the 16-part storyline \&quot;American Gothic\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Swamp Thing&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #35\u201350 (April 1985\u2013July 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; a civil war erupted in Hell as a result and the regency was split into the Second Triumvirate, which consisted of Etrigan the Demon, his mother Rann Va Dath of the Pit and Abaddon the Destroyer.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Demon #1\u20137\&quot; /&gt; This was only an interim triumvirate, however, and it was soon replaced by the Third Triumvirate.&lt;ref name=\&quot;TheSandman4\&quot;&gt;First seen in &#39;&#39;The Sandman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #4 (April 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Lucifer grew bored with his position, abdicated the throne of Hell and retired to Earth with his mistress, the lilim known as Mazikeen.&lt;ref name=\&quot;TheSandman21\&quot;&gt;This incident occurred in &#39;&#39;The Sandman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #21\u201328 (January\u2013July 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Geography===\nThe realms of the Vertigo version of Hell are not as defined as the ones in the DC Comics version after the &#39;&#39;Reign in Hell&#39;&#39; miniseries, but specific areas have been mentioned in various stories.\n\n*&#39;&#39;&#39;[[Dis (Divine Comedy)|Dis]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - A Hellcity, home to the palace of Lucifer Samael Morningstar.&lt;ref name=\&quot;TheSandman4\&quot; /&gt;\n*&#39;&#39;&#39;Effrul&#39;&#39;&#39; - The home Province of Lord Arux, an Arch-Duke of Hell.&lt;ref&gt;First seen in &#39;&#39;Lucifer&#39;&#39; #15 (August 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;\n*&#39;&#39;&#39;Mashkan-Shapir&#39;&#39;&#39; - A Hellcity formerly ruled by Nergal, an Arch-Duke of Hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=nergal |title=The Unofficial Nergal Biography |website=www.dcuguide.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220014854/http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=nergal |archive-date=2005-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Infernal sovereignty===\nThe hierarchy of the Vertigo version of Hell has changed several times over the millennia, the ruler of which has always assumed the title of &#39;&#39;&#39;Satan&#39;&#39;&#39;. There are also ranks among the demons, including Kings, Queens, Princes, Lords, Arch-Dukes, Dukes and several others as well.
