'''Cyclone''' ('''Maxine Hunkel''') is a [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. She is the granddaughter of the original [[Red Tornado (Ma Hunkel)|Red Tornado]] and a member of the [[Justice Society of America]].

The character made her live-action debut in the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Black Adam (film)|Black Adam]]'' (2022), played by [[Quintessa Swindell]].

==Publication history==
Although not named as such at the time, the character who would eventually become known as Maxine Hunkel first appeared (as a new Red Tornado) in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' #2 (June 1996) by writer [[Mark Waid]] and artist [[Alex Ross]].

A decade later, prior to the relaunch of the ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' series, writer [[Geoff Johns]] created Maxine Hunkel, a hero who would follow the legacy of the Red Tornado. Remembering the character he designed for ''Kingdom Come'', cover artist Alex Ross based his design for Maxine on the earlier character, [[retcon|retroactively]] making them one and the same.

Maxine made her debut in the [[DC Universe]] in ''Justice Society of America'' #1 (February 2007).

==Fictional character biography==
Maxine Hunkel is the granddaughter of the original Red Tornado, Abigail "''Ma''" Hunkel, an honorary member of the Justice Society and current caretaker of their headquarters. Maxine grew up idolizing her grandmother's allies in the JSA.

As a 6-year-old, Maxine was once kidnapped by [[T.O. Morrow]], the [[mad scientist]] who created the second [[Red Tornado]], a powerful android. Morrow infects Maxine with "nanobytes" that are the apparent source of her powers.

Cheerful, bubbly, and extremely intelligent (''4.0 GPA and a 1300 SAT score in high school''), Maxine is a 19-year-old student at [[Harvard University]] and an avid fan of the works of [[L. Frank Baum]], particularly [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|''The Wizard of Oz'']], and linked works such as the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]''. However, her talkative nature and know-it-all personality often alienates her peers and leave the young woman isolated. Her outcast status causes her to suffer from atypical depression.

As she reached adulthood, she began to manifest unusual superhuman abilities. A sneeze demolishes her grandmother's garage and, the next day, she awoke inside a [[tornado]] five hundred feet off the ground. The young woman soon realizes that she has the power to manipulate wind.

When the Justice Society decides to expand its ranks and provide training to new heroes, Maxine is one of the first on their list. She is invited to join the team by [[Power Girl]] and [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]] and accepts through extreme amounts of excitement (her motormouth response nearly causes them to revoke the offer). Shortly afterwards, she is introduced to the rest of the JSA and her fangirl personality becomes evident in her bubbling reaction to meeting her heroes, particularly fellow teen [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]]. During the first meeting of the group, the current holder of the [[Mister America (DC Comics)|Mr. America]] mantle literally falls into their midst and perishes. As a way to help her deal, fellow member Stargirl distracts her into building a superhero outfit.

Maxine officially debuts as Cyclone in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #3, honoring both the Red Tornado and her former sidekicks, the Cyclone Kids (Maxine's aunt and uncle Amelia "Sisty" Hunkel and Mortimer "Dinky" Jibbet). During this time, she also gains a pet monkey named "Frankie", whom she dresses up to look like one of the winged monkeys from [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|''The Wizard of Oz'']] (she also wears a green pointed hat from time to time, causing her to resemble both the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] (who wore an identical hat) and the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]). She undergoes a brief crush on teammate [[Damage (DC Comics)|Damage]] when he is made incredibly handsome temporarily, and slowly starts learning to become less of a motormouth.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #3.

Maxine is seen as part of the superhero army drafted by [[Alan Scott]] to defend various Earth interests from the conquering forces of [[Darkseid]].<ref>''Final Crisis'' #1–5 (2008). DC Comics.</ref>

After the JSA suffers a massive supervillain attack, the team divides into two. Cyclone joins the newly formed ''JSA All-Stars'' team, and soon after finds herself becoming attracted to her teammate [[King Chimera]].<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>

In the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]", Cyclone returns alongside many other superheroes to the DC Universe when [[Doctor Manhattan]], inspired by [[Superman]], undoes the changes that he made to the timeline that erased the Justice Society of America and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #12 (February 2020).

==Powers and abilities==
Maxine possesses the power of wind manipulation. She is able to mentally summon [[cyclone]]s and [[whirlwind]]s, project powerful bursts of air, and fly through the air by riding wind currents.

Maxine has unveiled that she can control sound currents as well, gathering and sending sound waves.

==Other versions==
Prior to her mainstream debut, Cyclone was featured in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' as an ally of Superman. She originally fought Superman's Justice League after his return until she decided to side with him. Cyclone accompanies the Justice League to the Gulag to deal with the prisoner revolt. When [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] under the control of Lex Luthor arrives at the Gulag and blasts it, the prisoners are freed as they attack the Justice League.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #2-4.

An alternate-reality version of Cyclone is seen in the ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'' series, as a member of the time-altered Justice Society International. She is killed in that timeline when she is sniped down while riding one of her cyclones.
