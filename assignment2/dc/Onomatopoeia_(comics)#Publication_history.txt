Created by writer [[Kevin Smith]] and artist [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]], the character first appeared in &#39;&#39;Green Arrow&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #12 (March 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Publication history==\nKevin Smith discussed the character in a 2007 interview:\n{{cquote|When I did Green Arrow, I went with Onomatopoeia for a villain, just because I loved that word, and it kind of formed the character inasmuch as he would say sounds out loud. It only kind of works \u2013 I think \u2013 on a comic book page because if you have a gun going off, they usually write BLAM! and then you can have, you know, the character saying \&quot;BLAM!\&quot; in a word balloon, but like if you tried to do that cinematically you can&#39;t really rock it. A gun in a film sounds completely different. It doesn&#39;t read as BLAM! and so to have a dude say BLAM!...I think it works great in print and on a comic book page. I don&#39;t think that character would translate very well outside of that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azhrialilu.com/article/25/interview-with-kevin-smith-aka-silent-bob|title=Interview with Kevin Smith aka Silent Bob|publisher=Azhrialilu|author=Lisa S|date=1 November 2007|access-date=2 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116015644/http://azhrialilu.com/article/25/interview-with-kevin-smith-aka-silent-bob|archive-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nOnomatopoeia first appears where he murders a female crimefighter named Virago, after telling her his name. The interlude in which this occurs serves as a lead-in to \&quot;The Sounds of Violence\&quot;, a three-issue storyline that runs through issues #13\u201315 of the title, in which he is the main antagonist.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} No personal characteristics are revealed about Onomatopoeia aside from the fact that he is a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] male, which is seen when portions of his face obscured by shadow are seen in &#39;&#39;Green Arrow&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #14, and when the lower half of his face is seen again in issue #15.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Onomatopoeia is a serial killer who targets non-[[superpower (ability)|superpower]]ed [[superhero]]es. His name is derived from the fact that he imitates noises around him, such as dripping taps, gunshots, etc. During the course of this storyline, he shoots [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]], the second Green Arrow, who is saved by his father [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] (the first and original Green Arrow). While Connor is undergoing surgery in the hospital, Onomatopoeia returns to finish the job. He kills several doctors in the operating room, and after his attempt to kill Connor is foiled by Queen and [[Black Canary]], he manages to escape.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHe is later recruited by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]&#39;s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] as part of an army that is sent to conquer the city of Metropolis in issue #7 of the 2006 miniseries &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39;. A superhero army, backed up by the National Guard, successfully opposes the Society. Onomatopoeia is seen in a brawl with the [[Odd Man (comics)|Odd Man]], a costumed, un-powered vigilante.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe character appears in the November 2008 three-issue miniseries &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Cacophony]]&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080818-dc-november-solicitations.html \&quot;DC Comics&#39; FULL November 2008 Solicitations\&quot;]. [[Newsarama]]. August 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; which was written by Smith and pencilled by his longtime collaborator and friend [[Walt Flanagan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsaskew.com/2008/07/25/smith-flanagan-to-create-new-batman-comic-series/ \&quot;Smith, Flanagan To Create New \&quot;Batman\&quot; Comic Series\u2026\&quot;], News Askiew, accessed March 13, 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731034901/http://www.newsaskew.com/2008/07/25/smith-flanagan-to-create-new-batman-comic-series/ |date=July 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Onomatopoeia frees the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from [[Arkham Asylum]] and gives him money to finance a gang war against [[Maxie Zeus]]. Eventually he confronts Batman, who defeats him. He escapes capture, however, by mortally wounding the Joker, forcing Batman to choose between saving the Joker&#39;s life and capturing his new opponent.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The end of the third issue reveals that Onomatopoeia has a secret, seemingly normal life as a loving husband and the father of two children, who are unaware of his murderous activities. He explains his occasional injuries as the result of sporting activities such as [[tennis]], [[polo]], and [[hunting]]. He keeps mementos of his victories in a hidden shrine behind a bookcase, saving a case each for Batman and Green Arrow.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Widening Gyre]]&#39;&#39;, it is revealed that he has been in disguise as Baphomet, a new vigilante who had been teaming up with Batman. He appears as Baphomet early on, helping the Dark Knight defeat [[Etrigan the Demon]] and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]. He later assists Batman in defeating villains such as [[Deadshot]], [[Crazy Quilt]], and [[Calendar Man]], even unmasking himself in front of Batman to gain his trust (as Batman had no idea what Onomatopoeia actually looked like, this did not reveal the ruse). At the storyline&#39;s end Batman takes Baphomet into the Batcave and introduces him to a disguised [[Silver St. Cloud]] before Batman reveals that he is Bruce Wayne and Silver unmasks herself. Bruce invites Baphomet to stay for breakfast as he turns away and puts his utility belt on the table with a \&quot;KA-KLAK\&quot;. He hears Baphomet repeating the sound before turning in horror to see Onomatopoeia midway through slicing Silver&#39;s throat and mimicking the noise of the blade.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Rebirth===\nOnomatopoeia first appeared in the [[New 52]] in the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Teen Titans]]&#39;&#39;. He appears inside a mover&#39;s truck on a ferry, the vehicle packed with explosives, seemingly wishing to blow up the ferry. However, [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] arrives on the scene, apprehending him on the ferry and driving the truck into the ocean. This was all a part of his plan however, as the fusion bomb in the truck soon detonates in the water, setting off a massive tidal wave that headed straight towards Star City.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #13&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhile the arriving Teen Titans and Red Arrow worked to save the city from the incoming tidal wave, Onomatopoeia broke into Queen Industries in the chaos, stealing high-grade weapons.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #14-15&lt;/ref&gt; As the team eventually saves the city, the serial killer then began to open fire down onto them with the weaponry he stole. However, [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] and [[Kid Flash]] were able to get around the firing bullets and defeat him. Onomatopoeia was among the villains captured by Robin and illegally imprisoned in a secret location.[3] He later took part in the prison breakout but was apprehended and imprisoned once more.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Deathstroke&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #43&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOnce Robin&#39;s illegal prison was discovered, Damian decided to brainwash his prisoners, including Onomatopoeia, into becoming citizens using the magic of Djinn. This magic would wear off however once Djinn was imprisoned within her ring by fellow member Roundhouse. Because of this, the villains who had been wronged by this band of Titans joined, using their combined wealth to hire [[Deathstroke]] to take revenge for them.\nAfter this plan failed, Onomatopoeia was not long after defeated once again by the Teen Titans and was properly arrested.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #46&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOnomatopoeia is an athlete, martial artist and weapons expert. He invariably carries two semiautomatic handguns, a sniper rifle, and an army knife. He appears to be quite intelligent, having orchestrated the Joker&#39;s escape to draw out Batman, as well as avoiding capture by giving the Joker a near-fatal wound, causing Batman to be distracted. His usual outfit consists of black gloves, pants, and shirt, with a long black [[trench coat]] and a full, black [[Hood (headgear)|hood]] decorated by concentric white circles. In &#39;&#39;Batman: Cacophony&#39;&#39;, it is revealed that he collects the masks of heroes he kills, keeping them in a trophy case in his secret identity&#39;s house.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: Cacophony&#39;&#39; #3. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; His marksmanship has been shown to rival even Deadshot&#39;s.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: Cacophony&#39;&#39; #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIt remains unrevealed whether or not Onomatopoeia is a [[metahuman]], however, it has been noted by the Green Arrow that he is enhanced in some way. In &#39;&#39;Green Arrow&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #15, he was shot with six arrows: two to one shoulder, with one fatally piercing through the left side of his chest, one arrow in between the first and middle knuckles of his right hand, one through his right foot, and one through the palm of his right hand \u2013 none of which slows him down or even impairs his manual dexterity. In the same issue he even catches one of the Green Arrow&#39;s arrows in midair, using only his teeth. After being shot, he jumps off the roof of the [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] hospital, falling seven stories, and runs away before the Green Arrow can find him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Arrow&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #15. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also durable enough to survive direct explosions and fires that would kill normal human beings.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: Cacophony&#39;&#39;. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==In other media==\n* Onomatopoeia appears in the &#39;&#39;Green Arrow&#39;&#39; short from &#39;&#39;[[DC Nation Shorts]]&#39;&#39;. He sends his Ono-Bots (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) to take down the Green Arrow and the Black Canary. They are defeated, but Onomatopoeia sneaks away with the heroes in pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/Na-zIOpfWNQ Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140905014210/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na-zIOpfWNQ Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na-zIOpfWNQ| title = DC Nation - Green Arrow - \&quot;Onomatopoeiabot\&quot; (full) | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* The [[Arrowverse]] Onomatopoeia appears as a comics exclusive villain covering the events after &#39;&#39;[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]&#39;&#39; [[Arrow (season 2)|Season 2]].
