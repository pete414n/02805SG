    "> Our network has 1602 nodes and 19068. The average in- and out-degree are both 11.75..., they are the same since each edge contributes one to the total out-degree and one to the total in-degree, and a difference would indicate that there somehow where a higher total in-degree than a total out-degree, or vice versa. The median in degree is 5, and the median out degree is 9. The mode for in degree is 0, which corresponds to characters that link to other characters, but are not linked to by anyone else. The mode for out degree is 2. These two numbers tells us that the most common in- and out-degree is relatively low, considering the total number of nodes. The minimum in- and out-degree are both 0, an out-degree of 0 corresponds to a character that links to no other characters, but is linked to by at least one other character. The maximum in-degree is 429, this is the character that most other characters are linking to, corresponding to roughly 1/4 of all of our nodes linking to this single node. The maximum out degree is 68, which corresponds to the character that has the most links to other characters. Overall these numbers indicates to us that the graph is not very dense, since it looks like we (might) have quite a few nodes that do not have many edges going in or out of them. At the same time this also indicates that we must have some nodes that have many links, relatively to the others. "

Even though most heroes are more well documented with love affairs, families etc, they are also more likely to have a \"sad\" origin story, and have more well documented deaths of other characters around them. Since the heroes are usually the main characters they also appear in more stories, and as stated previously many of these stories may have titles containing \"sad\" words such as war, weapon, fight etc. On the other hand the villains may be less well documented, and appear in fewer comics. As such a villain that has its origin in an origin story love, fantasy, or protection of something, may get a higher sentiment, simply because it has fewer words, and a larger fraction of them are \"happy\". We are not comic book experts, so these are just some thoughts that might explain what we saw above."
