One of the first things he did was shut down Stilt-Man's brain, albeit temporarily, so that he would not reveal his employer's name to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], who at the time was acting as an agent for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and had his mind wiped to think he was Laurent Levasseur.<ref>''Daredevil'' #377</ref> 

While La Concierge was battling Laurent, Synapse was holding Dr. Claudia DuBois hostage along with [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]].
