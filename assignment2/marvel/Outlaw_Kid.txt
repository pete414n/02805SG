'''The Outlaw Kid'''  is a fictional [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character originally appeared in the company's 1950s iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schelly |first1=William |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1950s |date=2013 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781605490540 |pages=124–125}}</ref> A lesser-known character than the company's [[Kid Colt]], [[Rawhide Kid]] or [[Two-Gun Kid]], he also starred in a reprint series in the 1970s and a short-lived revival.

The Outlaw Kid was Lance Temple, an [[Old West]] lawyer and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran living with his blinded father on a ranch. Though promising his father he would never take up a gun, he nonetheless felt the need to right wrongs expediently on the near-lawless frontier, and created a masked identity in order to keep his gunslinging secret.

==Publication history==
Comic-book artist [[Doug Wildey]], later a noted animation designer, illustrated three to four stories per issue of the 19-issue series ''The Outlaw Kid'' ([[cover date]]d Sept. 1954-Sept. 1957). [[Joe Maneely]] provided most of the covers. Backup features were usually "[[Black Rider (comics)|The Black Rider]]," drawn by [[Syd Shores]], or an anthological Western tale. An additional Outlaw Kid story appeared in ''[[Wild Western]]'' #43 (May 1955). Well over a year after the original series ended, two other Outlaw Kid stories by Wildey, presumably from inventory, saw print, in ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'' #82 (Jan. 1959) and ''Wyatt Earp'' #24 (Aug. 1959).

Comics historian Ken Quattro called the series Wildey's most "noteworthy" Western work:

When Marvel began reprinting the series in ''The Outlaw Kid'' vol. 2, #1–30 (Aug. 1970 – Oct. 1975), it became the best-selling among the company's Western reprints.<ref name="evanier">Evanier, Mark.

When the 1950s Wildey material ran out, Marvel commissioned new stories, by writer [[Mike Friedrich]], followed by the unrelated [[Gary Friedrich]], with art by Marvel Western veteran [[Dick Ayers]]. Yet with these new stories, in issues #10–16 (Oct. 1972 – June 1973), sales dropped, after which the title began re-reprinting Wildey's work.<ref name="evanier"/> Wildey reprints also appeared in the 1970s Marvel series ''[[Mighty Marvel Western]]'' (#9) and ''[[Western Gunfighters]]''<!--#8-10?-->.<!--One source lists an Outlaw Kid appearance in Rawhide Kid #46 (June 1965), but it is unclear if he guests in Rawhide Kid story, or if he stars in 5-page backup "The Warning," written and penciled by Alex Toth, inked by Vince Colletta. The Rawhide Kid #148 & 150 apps. the source also lists are almost certainly reprints.-->

The Outlaw Kid reappeared in the four-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes]]'' (2000), by writer [[John Ostrander]] and artist [[Leonardo Manco]], which specifically [[retconned]] that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely [[dime novel]] fictions of the characters' actual lives. It was revealed here that Temple's father, who did not want him gunslinging, had died from the shock of learning of his son's alter ego, and that a guilt-wracked Temple, blaming himself for his father's death, developed a [[split personality]] and was unaware he was the Outlaw Kid. Indeed, he was actually searching for the Outlaw Kid in the miniseries. He dies in the last issue, helping defend the town of Wonderment. His last act was to use dynamite to kill some opponents, noting his father would have been happy he did not use a gun. As series writer [[John Ostrander]] explained,
