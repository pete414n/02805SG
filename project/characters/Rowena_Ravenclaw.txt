{{Quote|Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure.|Ravenclaw's philosophy|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
'''Rowena Ravenclaw''' (fl. c. [[First millennium A.D.|993]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[wizardkind|witch]] and one of the [[Hogwarts founders|four founders]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She was noted for her intelligence and creativity. Ravenclaw died sometime in the [[11th century|eleventh century]], after she fell fatally ill. Legend had it that a broken heart was the cause — because her daughter [[Helena Ravenclaw|Helena]] ran away with her [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|diadem]]. Rowena's portrait remained at Hogwarts.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|Fair Ravenclaw, from glen….|The [[Sorting Hat]] on Ravenclaw's birthplace|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Rowena Ravenclaw was born sometime in the [[First millennium A.D.|tenth century]]. She was from the glens of [[Scotland]],

At an unknown time and by unknown means, Rowena acquired a [[wand]]. It is possible she purchased it from the [[Ollivander family]], who had been in the [[wand]]-making business since [[B.C. era|382 B.C.]], or made it herself.

===Hogwarts founder===
{{Quote|You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.|[[Cuthbert Binns]] teaching Hogwarts' history|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Rowena Ravenclaw at WWHP.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Rowena Ravenclaw wearing her diadem]]
United by the common goal of creating the world's best [[Wizarding school|magic school]], It is a popular historical theory that the location and name of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] were both chosen by Rowena, who dreamt that a warty hog was leading her to a cliff by the lake. She also came up with the ever-changing floor plan.

Rowena selected her students according to intelligence and wisdom. At some point, Rowena bore a daughter, [[Helena Ravenclaw|Helena]],

After a time in which the school enjoyed great prosperity, Rowena's fellow founder Salazar Slytherin proposed a controversial action in which [[Muggle-born]] students should not be admitted to Hogwarts based on their heritage. Ironically, a large percentage of Ravenclaw's own house were of Muggle descent. She and the rest of the founders refused Slytherin's plan and the problem escalated to such degrees that Salazar ultimately left the school permanently.

===Later life and death===
{{Quote|I stole the [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|diadem]]. I sought to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it. My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Then my mother fell ill — fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so.|[[Helena Ravenclaw]]'s ghost reminiscing on her past|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

At some point after her graduation from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]], her daughter Helena stole [[Ravenclaw's diadem]], which was said to enhance the wearer's wisdom. Helena was jealous of her mother's famous intellect and took the diadem with her to [[Albania]], far away from her mother's reach, in hopes of surpassing her. Ashamed of her daughter's betrayal, Rowena opted to keep her daughter's treachery a secret from others and denied it even from her fellow founders.

Shortly afterwards, Rowena fell fatally ill. Disregarding her treason, she asked the [[Bloody Baron|Baron]], who was in love with Helena, to go and find her daughter, merely wishing to see her one last time. He eventually tracked her to a forest in [[Albania]] but when she refused to return with him, the Baron flew into a fit of rage, furious at her refusal and envious of her freedom, and stabbed her. Immediately overcome with guilt, he then took his own life. The two would later become, respectively, [[Ravenclaw]] and [[Slytherin]] house [[ghost]]s. 

Thus, Rowena apparently didn't get the chance to reconcile with her daughter before their untimely deaths, unless her daughter's ghost returned to the castle before Rowena's own death. Legend had it that a "''broken heart''" added to her early demise. This story may have had origin in her estrangement with her daughter. Rowena was the first of the founders to die

===Legacy===
Rowena's stolen diadem would remain hidden in its lonely locale for centuries until the mid [[1900s]], where her daughter's ghost was charmed by Sytherin student [[Tom Riddle]], who, unbeknownst to her, was a distant relative of Salazar Slytherin himself, into revealing its location. Acting on this information, Riddle took the diadem from its hiding place and defiled both it and the memory of Ravenclaw by turning it into a [[Horcrux]]. The defiled artefact was then hidden within the castle Rowena had helped build for years more until it was destroyed by [[Vincent Crabbe]]'s out-of-control [[Fiendfyre]], during a failed attempt to kill by [[Harry Potter]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]].

[[File:Rowena Ravenclaw's portrait in History of Magic HM65.png|thumb|250px|right|Rowan Khanna using Rowena's portrait in History of Magic]]
During the [[1988–1989 school year]] and also the [[1989–1990 school year]], [[Rowan Khanna]], who aspired to be a professor, would sometimes teach the [[History of Magic]] class during [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns']]s frequent naps and inattention. One of Rowen's techniques was to bring in a [[portrait]] of Ravenclaw, allowing classmates to hear about the founding of Hogwarts directly from the memories of one of the founders.

According to the questionable publication ''[[The Quibbler]]'', Rowena also developed a strategy for traversing the tricky stairs of the [[Grand Staircase]].

==Physical appearance==
From her statue in [[Ravenclaw Tower]] and [[Xenophilius Lovegood]]'s bust of her, Rowena was a beautiful yet austere-looking and slightly intimidating woman. She was tall,

==Personality and traits==
[[File:RavenclawCard.jpg|220x220px|thumb|right|Ravenclaw drawing up Hogwarts's ever-changing floor plan]]
Ravenclaw's most notable traits were her intelligence and creativity. She valued the same characteristics in her students. Rowena seemed strict and intimidating, but despite this she seemed to be forgiving and loving. This shown by the fact that she was willing to disregard [[Helena Ravenclaw|her daughter]]'s betrayal just to see her one last time on her deathbed.

Ravenclaw was very proud, not admitting that her daughter had run away with [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|her diadem]] not even to her close friends, the other [[Hogwarts founders|founders]].

==Magical abilities and skills==
Ravenclaw was described as the most brilliant [[Wizardkind|witch]] of her time. Her capacity to cast a [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] further showed her superior [[magic]]al abilities.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Rowena had a considerable level of skill and proficiency in charms. Along with the other founders, she bewitched the [[Sorting Hat]] into a sentient [[magic]]al artefact with personality to [[Sorting ceremony|sort]] students well after their lifetime. She presumably enchanted her [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|diadem]] to enhance the wearer's wisdom. Furthermore, Rowena was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], despite its immense difficulty.   
*'''Magical architecture''': It is thought that Rowena herself devised the ever-changing floor plan of [[Hogwarts Castle]].
*'''[[Divination]]''': According to legend, Rowena dreamt about a warty hog leading her to a cliff by the lake where she and her companions would build Hogwarts.
*'''Invention''': Rowena presumably crafted and enchanted [[Ravenclaw's diadem|her diadem]] personally. No other witch or wizard was ever able to replicate its effects.
*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Rowena's portrait was knowledgeable about wizarding history and could help teach this to students in [[History of Magic]] lessons, which [[Rowan Khanna]]'s assistance.

==Possessions==
[[File:Ravenclaws Diadem.png|thumb|Ravenclaw's Diadem]]
*'''[[Wand]]''': Ravenclaw owned a wand made of an unknown [[Wand wood|wood]], length, [[Wand core|core]] and flexibility.
*'''[[Ravenclaw's Diadem|Diadem]]''': Rowena owned a diadem [[Charm|enchanted]], presumably by Ravenclaw herself, to enhance the wearer's wisdom. The diadem was stolen by her daughter Helena Ravenclaw and hidden in an Albanian forest. It was later found and turned into a [[Horcrux]] by [[Tom Riddle]].

==Etymology==
*In [[Wikipedia:Welsh poetry|Welsh poetry]], Rowena is named "mother of the nation", which could link in to her being a founder of Hogwarts. She also is another character whose name surfaces in the great epic ''[[Wikipedia:Ivanhoe|Ivanhoe]]''. Rowena is a Latinised form of an old Germanic name: "Fame" (cf. the Anglo-Saxon hrōd, or hrōð), and "Joy", (cf. the Anglo-Saxon wyn(n)), or "Friend", (cf. the Anglo-Saxon wine). Rowena, Queen of Britain, is a figure in Britain's traditional history; she was supposedly the daughter of Hengest and the wife of Vortigern.
*Other character of the same is Lady Rowena Trevanion from the short story "Ligeia" by Edgar Allan Poe (who also wrote "The Raven") whom the narrator marries after the death of his first wife with raven-colored hair. When Lady Rowena dies, he watches as she comes back to life in the form of his first wife.
*Ravenclaw is simply 'raven' + 'claw'. A raven is a large black bird that belongs to the crow family. However, Ravenclaw's symbol is an eagle. Ravens and other birds of the corvid family are known to be smart birds and quick learners.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Rowena Ravenclaw.png|thumb|Rowena Ravenclaw in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]
[[File:RowenaRavenclawLEGO.jpg|thumb|Rowena Ravenclaw as a LEGO mini-figure]]
*Rowena Ravenclaw is played by actress Lynne Pearson in {{HPFJ}}.
*In {{DH|F2}}, Harry has a vision of [[Hogwarts Castle]], a woman, and a banner of [[Ravenclaw]]. Harry incorrectly identifies the woman as Rowena Ravenclaw, when it is in fact her daughter Helena.
*Both Rowena and her friend Helga were referred to as males in the Sorting Hat's song in early German editions and in the German audiobook of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire read by Rufus Beck. This was corrected in later editions of the book.
*Ravenclaw was featured as [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]]'s "[[Wizard of the Month]]" for August, 2007: "''One of the four famous Founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Rowena Ravenclaw was the most brilliant witch of her time, though legend has it that a broken heart — cause unknown — contributed to her early demise''".
*It is possible that Ravenclaw is not Rowena's birth name, but her married name, although this has never been confirmed by [[J. K. Rowling|J.K Rowling]]. This theory is supported by the fact that Ravenclaw is also her [[Helena Ravenclaw|daughter]]'s surname. Also even though the word "Raven" is in Ravenclaw's name, the crest of her house depicts an eagle. However, given that she was a proud woman, she could simply have declined to take the surname of her possible husband (father of Helena) upon marriage and kept her maiden name. It is also possible that she was never married.
**It is interesting to note that Albania is sometimes considered the "Land of Eagles" in the 16th century and that Rowena's daughter fled to Albania, so it is therefore possible that Rowena's family or her possible husband's came from Albania before settling into Scotland.
*Rowena Ravenclaw's [[Chocolate Frog Card]], as featured in the PC video games of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', Rowena is somewhat anachronistically depicted wearing sixteenth/seventeenth-century garments, while Ravenclaw lived in the tenth century.
