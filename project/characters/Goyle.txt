{{Quote|And here, we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?|[[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] greeting his Death Eaters in the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
'''Mr Goyle''' was a [[Dark Wizard]], [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], husband of [[Gregory Goyle's mother|Mrs Goyle]] and the father of [[Gregory Goyle|Gregory]]. Goyle fought during the [[First Wizarding War]]. He didn't search for [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] after his first downfall, but this was forgiven in [[1995]], after Voldemort's [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] at the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]], in which Goyle was present.<ref name="GOF33"/> Goyle possibly fought at several battles of the Second Wizarding War, including the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. After the battle and Voldemort's final defeat, Goyle was presumably killed or imprisoned in [[Azkaban]].

==Biography==
===First Wizarding War===
Goyle was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] during the [[First Wizarding War]] and was loyal to his master up until his downfall, when Goyle managed to avoid [[Azkaban]].<ref name="GOF33"/> Around the downfall of Voldemort, Goyle and [[Gregory Goyle's mother|his wife]] had a baby boy, [[Gregory Goyle]], who would be educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] from [[1991]] to [[1998]], and be friends with [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Draco Malfoy]].

===Second Wizarding War===
{{Quote|My father reckons [[Amelia Bones|your aunt]]'s a troublemaker, someone will teach her a lesson!|[[Gregory Goyle]] mentioning his father to [[Susan Bones]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)}}Goyle was one of the few Death Eaters who returned to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] when he rose to power again in [[1995]]. Voldemort was displeased when he learned that Goyle did not attempt to find him, but Goyle was forgiven.<ref name="GOF33">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref>

During the [[1995-1996 school year]], Goyle's son, [[Gregory Goyle|Gregory]], and [[Vincent Crabbe's father|Crabbe]]'s son, [[Vincent Crabbe|Vincent]], both cornered [[Susan Bones]], and Gregory told her that his father thought that her aunt [[Amelia Bones]] was a trouble-maker.<ref name="OOTPG">{{OOTP|G}}</ref>

His actions following his master's return are unknown. It is likely that he participated in many battles during the [[Second Wizarding War]], including the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. He was presumably killed or imprisoned in Azkaban following Voldemort's defeat.

==Physical description==
Much like his son he was described as a large man, about as large as [[Crabbe]] and significantly more so than [[Nott]]. He was also known to have a dull sounding voice.<ref name="GOF33"/>

==Personality and traits==
Not much is known about Goyle's individual personality, though he appeared to be somewhat unintelligent. He was however outspoken against certain [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] employees such as [[Amelia Bones]], possibly for being against the [[Death Eaters]] or for giving [[Harry Potter]] a free [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|trial]].<ref name="OOTPG"/> He apparently was not loyal enough to search for his [[Tom Riddle|master]] after his original downfall or otherwise believed him to be finished.<ref name="GOF33"/> Being a Death Eater, it can presumed he shared his master's ideals of [[pure-blood supremacy]], as he was one of the Death Eaters who returned to Voldemort's side once he had returned, showing his loyalty and commitment to his dark master and his cause.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, Goyle would have been accomplished with dark magic, likely including the [[Unforgivable Curses]].
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most adult wizards, Goyle was capable of apparating at will. He successfully apparated to the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]] in [[1995]] to witness the [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] of his master.<ref name="GOF33"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is not specified if Goyle attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], though if he did he was likely in [[Slytherin]] like his son.
*Goyle's only specified appearance is in {{GOF}}. It is unverified if he participated in any of the later events of the [[Second Wizarding War]].
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Goyle was played by [[Alex Palmer]],<ref>[http://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/alex-palmer Alex Palmer Showreel]</ref> but was only credited as "Death Eater".<ref>{{IMDb name|0658099|Alex Palmer}}</ref>
