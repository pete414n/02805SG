He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]] declaring the loyalty of her, [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]] and her brother-in-law Rabastan to the [[Tom Riddle|Dark Lord]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

'''Rabastan Lestrange''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], brother of [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]], and brother-in-law of [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] [[Lestrange]]. He was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who fought in the [[First Wizarding War]]. The [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]] were among [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s most loyal and trusted servants, the only ones who searched for him after his first downfall.  

After Voldemort's first downfall, Rabastan, Rodolphus, his wife [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] participated in the [[Attack on Frank and Alice Longbottom|torture and permanent incapacitation]] of [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]] and were sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. 

Rabastan later escaped with a group of [[Death Eaters]] and fought in several battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]], including the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], and possibly the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

After Lord Voldemort's final defeat, Rabastan was presumably killed, imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] once more, or defected.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rabastan presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]] house, like his brother Rodolphus. It is possible that he didn't attend Hogwarts at the same time as Rodolphus, as he was not mentioned among a small group of Slytherins and future [[Death Eaters]], as Rodolphus and [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] were.

===First Wizarding War===
[[File:B4C30M1 Wizengamot trial Pensieve memory.png|250px|thumb|left|Rabastan is tried before the [[Council of Magical Law]], along with [[Rodolphus Lestrange|his brother]], [[Bellatrix Lestrange|his sister-in-law]], and Barty Crouch Jnr|alt=]]

Rabastan served as one of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]. He, along with [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], were among Voldemort's most loyal servants.

Soon after the conflict ended in late [[1981]], Rabastan was put on [[Trial of the Lestranges and Bartemius Crouch Junior|trial]] with his brother [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]], sister-in-law [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] for being a Death Eater and for participating in the [[Cruciatus Curse|torture]] of [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]]. They were all sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]].<ref name="GOF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref>

===Second Wizarding War===
====Escape from Azkaban====
Rabastan [[Azkaban escapes#1996|escaped]] Azkaban in [[1996]], along with his brother, sister-in-law and several other Death Eaters with the [[Dementor]]s' defection to Voldemort, who had returned.

====Battle of the Department of Mysteries====

[[File:Death Eaters attacking Department of Mysteries - Pottemore moment.jpg|thumb|250px|Rabastan and fellow Death Eaters standing in the [[Hall of Prophecy]]]]
He later participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. He went with fellow Death Eater [[Crabbe|Crabbe Snr]] to find six D.A. members, and went to the Time Room, where Harry, Hermione, and Neville, were hiding. He may have been the Death Eater whose head fell into the [[bell jar]] and turned into a baby's head.<ref name="OOTP35">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref> He was presumably returned to Azkaban afterwards, though he was at large once again by late [[1997]] after another [[Azkaban escapes#1997|Azkaban break-out]].

Presumably, Rabastan participated in other battles in the [[Second Wizarding War]], including the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. It is unknown what happened to Rabastan after Voldemort's death. He was either killed or imprisoned again in Azkaban.

==Physical appearance==
Rabastan was described as a quite thin man. It is unknown if [[Azkaban]] took a toll on his appearance. As a Death Eater, he bore the [[Dark Mark]] on his left inner forearm, which had faded to a mere scar upon Voldemort's death.

==Personality and traits==
Rabastan was a very loyal [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], willing to use the [[Dark Arts]] to commit atrocities for the sake of his master Lord Voldemort. He didn't appear to be as brave or calm as his brother, given how he was said to be "nervous-looking" during his trial in 1981, with his eyes "darting around the crowd" whereas his brother Rodolphus "stared blankly" at the crowd.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, Rabastan was highly proficient with dark magic and [[dark charm]]s, being a powerful [[Dark Wizard]]. Rabastan could cast the [[Cruciatus Curse]], an exceptionally dark [[curse]] which requires power, ability and malice to perform, to devastating effect on [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]], rendering them both insane from the torture.<ref name="GOF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref>
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Rabastan participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], showing he was a competent duellist with considerable talent in [[martial magic]].<ref name="OOTP35">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref> He likely participated in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and helped his brother duel [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. If Rabastan fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] he most likely fled when the reinforcements arrived or was overwhelmed by them.

==Etymology==
The name Rabastan may be a play on [[Wikipedia:Rastaban|Rastaban]], the traditional name of one of the stars of the constellation Draco. It is derived from an Arabic phrase "Rās al-Thu`bān (رأس الثعبان)" meaning "head of the serpent"; the snake is a symbol strongly connected with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and [[Slytherin]]. The star is also known as ''Alwaid'', meaning "who is to be destroyed" in Arabic.

His name might otherwise be derived from the Germanic elements ''hraban ''("raven") and ''stein'' ("stone"), the latter of which became ''stan ''in Old English. The Germanic origins of [[Rodolphus Lestrange|his brother's]] name might support this theory.

The name "Lestrange" echoes the French phrase ''l'étrange'', literally "the strange one." In Old French, ''estrange'' means "foreigner."<ref>[[Rodolphus Lestrange|Behind the Name: French Surnames]]</ref> The surname may allude to English journalist {{wplink|Roger L'Estrange}}, who was known for opposing religious toleration and for being involved in plots against the government of William and Mary, similar to the Lestranges' intolerance about [[Blood status|blood purity]] and involvement in the [[Death Eaters]] organisation.

==Behind the scenes==
*During the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Rabastan was paired with fellow [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Crabbe]] during the pursuit of the [[Dumbledore's Army]] members. He and Crabbe pursued [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Neville Longbottom]] into the [[Department of Mysteries#Time Chamber|Time Chamber]]. It is unknown whether Rabastan was the Death Eater whom Harry [[Stunning Spell|stunned]], or the one whom Hermione knocked into a [[bell jar]], causing the head to continuously age and de-age. It is likely to be the former, as Rabastan is said to be thin while the baby-headed Death Eater's arms are said to be thick, and Rabastan likely would have been recognised and referred to by name in the book (as Dolohov was) if it was he who took his mask off.<ref>See [[Forum:Baby-Death Eater]].</ref>
*Interestingly, [[Sirius Black]] does not mention him as a member of the [[gang of Slytherins]] during his time at Hogwarts, though Rabastan's [[Rodolphus Lestrange|brother]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange|sister-in-law]] were. It's possible that he did not attend Hogwarts at the same time as his brother, though it's also likely that Sirius simply did not name the entire group.
