'''Hannah Abbott'''<!--- Please do not call her 'Hannah Longbottom', as it is unknown if she took her husband's surname after marriage, or if she kept her maiden family name.---> (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]) was a [[half-blood]] [[wizardkind|witch]] and a member of the [[Abbott family]]. In [[September]] [[1991]], she started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]]. Hannah was in the same year as the famous [[Harry Potter]].

In her [[fifth year]], she became both a [[prefect]] and a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. In [[1996]], Hannah was pulled out of school after [[Hannah Abbott's mother|her mother]] was murdered by [[Death Eaters]], but she returned the following year and was once again a member of the D.A. She fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on [[2 May]], [[1998]].

Later in life, Hannah married fellow classmate [[Neville Longbottom]] and became landlady of the [[Leaky Cauldron]], which the couple lived above. She eventually trained as a [[healer]] and applied for the job of [[Matron]] at Hogwarts.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hannah was born in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]] in [[1979]] or [[1980]]. though she herself was a half-blood, indicating she also had some Muggle heritage.

===Hogwarts years {{C|1991-1998}}===
====First year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Minerva McGonagall|When I call your name, you will put on the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] and sit on the [[Sorting Ceremony stool|stool]] to be sorted. Abbott, Hannah!|Sorting Hat|[[Hufflepuff|HUFFLEPUFF]]!|Hannah Abbott being Sorted into Hufflepuff|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Students2.PNG|250px|thumb|left|Hannah's sorting on [[1 September]], [[1991]]]]

Hannah began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September]], [[1991]], along with [[Harry Potter]].

Since Hannah's surname, Abbott, was the first alphabetically, she was the first new student in her year to be sorted into her house during the [[Welcoming Feast]]. She was Sorted into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]], along with other new students [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Susan Bones]], and [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]]. She shared a dormitory with her fellow Hufflepuff classmates; [[Megan Jones]], [[Susan Bones]], and others.

====Second year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hannah|You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?|Ernie Macmillan|Hannah, he's a [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]]. Everyone knows that's the mark of a [[Dark Wizard]]. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to [[snake]]s? They called [[Salazar Slytherin|Slytherin]] himself Serpent-tongue|He always seems so nice, though, and, well, he's the one who made [[Tom Riddle|You-Know-Who]] disappear. He can't be all bad, can he?|Hannah, Ernie and several Hufflepuff students discussing Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Ernie macmillian.png|250px|thumb|Hannah and Ernie studying with other Hufflepuffs]]
In [[1992]], Hannah's [[second year]], when the [[Chamber of Secrets]] had been reopened, Hannah was one of the many students who believed that [[Harry Potter]] was the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]] after it became known that he was a [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]]. She was initially sceptical, saying that Harry <nowiki>'</nowiki>''always seemed so nice''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, but was eventually convinced by her friend Ernie Macmillan that Harry was the one that had attacked [[Muggle-born]] students around Hogwarts, including her housemate and friend [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], which didn't go down well with Hannah, unsettling her.

[[File:Hufflepuffs in Transfiguration class.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hannah during a second year Transfiguration lesson]]

When Hermione was attacked by the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]], Ernie and Hannah apologised, knowing Harry would never harm her. Ernie asked Harry if he believed that [[Draco Malfoy]] was the Heir of Slytherin, to which Harry replied with a quick no, causing both Ernie and Hannah to stare. It was later revealed that Malfoy was not the culprit after Harry defeated [[Tom Riddle]], destroying [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|his diary horcrux]] and [[Serpent of Slytherin|Slytherin's basilisk]] in the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. Hannah was present at the [[End-of-Term Feast]], after all the students who were [[Petrification|petrified]] were returned to their normal state.

====Third year====
{{Quote|The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class telling anyone who'd listen that Black could turn into a flowering shrub.|Hannah's wild theory about Sirius Black|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Hannah Abbott COS.PNG|250px|thumb|Hannah studying with fellow [[Hufflepuff]]s]]
In [[1993]], her [[third year]], when news got out that [[Sirius Black]] had escaped from [[Azkaban]], Hannah held the belief that [[Sirius Black|Black]] could transform himself into a flowering shrub to avoid detection, and would tell this theory to anyone who would listen. 

Even though her theory of transforming into a shrub was incorrect, Sirius Black did in fact use a [[Animagus|transformation]] to avoid detection and escape [[Azkaban]]; however, his transformation was into the form of a dog. Hannah's belief that Sirius could transform into a flowering shrub was likely to have originated from her liking of [[Herbology]] and the [[Professor]] of [[Herbology]], [[Pomona Sprout]], who was her [[Head of House]].

====Fourth year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Pomona Sprout|An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.|Hannah|Like poor Eloise Midgen. She tried to curse hers off.|Silly girl. But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.|Hannah and Professor Sprout during a fourth year Herbology class|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Hufflepuff's teasing Harry.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hannah and [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] harassing Harry with their ''Support Cedric'' badges|alt=]]

During [[1994]], Hannah's [[fourth year]], Hannah helped collect [[Bubotuber pus]] in Herbology, which [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] used for treating [[acne]] to prevent students from taking more desperate measures. Hannah noted that [[Eloise Midgen]] had tried to [[curse]] her pimples off.

This year Hogwarts hosted the [[Triwizard Tournament]] and Hannah's fellow Hufflepuff [[Cedric Diggory]] was one of the Triwizard finalists. Hannah fully supported him during the tournament's tasks, as he was also in Hufflepuff. Hannah was among the many Hufflepuffs who were displeased when Harry appeared to be usurping Cedric's rightful place, by becoming the second [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] champion during the Triwizard Tournament, and she showed support only for her fellow Hufflepuff.

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-Hannah & Ernie.jpg|250px|thumb|Hannah with Ernie watching the Third Task of the tournament|alt=]]

This was because [[Hufflepuff]] never received much attention, and she, along with many others, felt Harry was taking the glory away from Diggory.

Again, as in her [[second year]], Hannah spent a lot of her free time revising in the [[Great Hall]] with Ernie Macmillan, presumably studying for her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] which were coming up the following year. The two of them also attended at least one Hogsmeade weekend and were swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a table at [[Three Broomsticks Inn|The Three Broomsticks]].

Later in this same year, Cedric Diggory was murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and Harry won the Triwizard Tournament, but this did not matter to Hannah, as Cedric's death made the winner rather irrelevant. Hannah was then presumably amongst the students that believed Harry Potter's claims that Lord Voldemort had indeed returned, and that the [[Second Wizarding War]] had really broken out.

====Fifth year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hannah|I — I need to think. To remember! Oh, I'm never going to finish my revision!|Hermione Granger|Well, we can help you with one subject — we're having our first Defence Against the Dark Arts meeting.|M-meeting? But Umbridge has banned clubs. She'll see us going there! I'll fail my O.W.L.s! I'll be expelled! We'll all be expelled!|Discussion of the D.A.'s meeting times and O.W.L.s|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)}}

[[File:B5C16M1 First meeting in the Hog's Head.png|250px|thumb|left|The first ever meeting of Dumbledore's Army, that Hannah attended|alt=]]

In [[1995]], her [[fifth year]], Hannah was made a [[prefect]] for [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]], along with Ernie Macmillan.

She was also one of the minority who believed that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was back, likely due to the fact that Cedric Diggory, a student of her house, was claimed by Harry Potter to have been murdered by the Dark Lord in the previous year.

[[File:Dumbledore's Army in circle.JPG|250px|thumb|Dumbledore's Army in circle|alt=]]

The pressure of studying for her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] had definitely got to Hannah, and she broke down in tears during a [[Herbology]] class, after claiming to be too stupid to take her exams. She was then taken to the Hospital Wing, where [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] treated her with a [[Calming Draught]]. Despite being treated, Hannah still managed to let pressure get the better of her and during her [[Transfiguration]] practical exam, she accidentally multiplied a [[ferret]] into a flock of [[flamingo]]s.

Hannah made it through the rest of her exams, and, approaching the end of the year, Hannah was one of the D.A. members who aided Harry when he was attacked by [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Gregory Goyle]], and [[Vincent Crabbe]] at the end of their fifth year, proving her loyalty and friendship still to Dumbledore's Army, even after its initial purpose had been rendered redundant.

At some point within the school year, she was a [[Charms Tutor]], providing a service to fellow classmates to teach them [[charm]]s.

====Sixth year====
{{Quote|There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of [[Herbology]] to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since.|The death of Hannah's mother|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:B6C18M1 Apparition lessons in the Great Hall.png|250px|thumb|left|Sixth year Apparition lesson|alt=]]

In [[1996]], Hannah returned to her [[sixth year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Early on during her sixth year, Hannah was told during a Herbology lesson that her mother, [[Hannah Abbott's mother|Mrs Abbott]], had been murdered earlier in the day, presumably by [[Death Eaters]]. As a result of this, Hannah was subsequently pulled out of Hogwarts and did not return for the rest of the year. She was not in school at the time of Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s demise at the hands of [[Severus Snape]]. It is possible, as a result of missing most of her sixth year, Hannah would be required to retake the year's courses.

====Seventh year====
{{Quote|Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it.|Hannah escapes death in the second half of  the final battle|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Death Eaters storm train.jpg|250px|thumb|Hannah watching Neville Longbottom stand up to Death Eaters when they storm the [[Hogwarts Express]]|alt=]]

Hannah was compelled to return to Hogwarts in [[1997]], as [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had taken over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and attendance at Hogwarts had become mandatory for all pure or half-blood students; Muggle-borns had to go before a [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] prior to being admitted to Hogwarts. It is possible, as Hannah had missed her previous year of education, she would be made to resit the year, making her technically a sixth year student once again. 

[[File:Unidentified Hufflepuff Girl.png|150px|thumb|left|Hannah fighting during the Battle of Hogwarts|alt=]]
Hannah was present on the train when it was stormed by Death Eaters in search of [[Harry Potter]]. She also witnessed fellow classmate Neville stand up to them and inform them that Harry was not aboard the train.

Whilst back at Hogwarts, Hannah became a member of the revived Dumbledore's Army, now operating under the leadership of [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Luna Lovegood]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] in the absence of Harry, Ron and Hermione. United once again, Dumbledore's Army continued to train students in battle and defence, and the group ran riot around Hogwarts, making the life for new Headmaster [[Severus Snape]] and Death Eaters [[Amycus Carrow]] and [[Alecto Carrow]] difficult.

=====Battle of Hogwarts=====
When Harry Potter returned to Hogwarts on [[1 May]] [[1998]], Hannah stayed at the school and fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. She battled against Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort. Initially, she was part of the group of students led by [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]. Hannah's group was charged with defending the secret passages into Hogwarts from invading Death Eaters.[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|thumb|250x250px|Hannah witnesses Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, thus ending the Second Wizarding War|alt=]]During the second stage of the battle, she witnessed Voldemort and his Death Eaters gloating over Harry's 'dead body'. She was then forced into the Great Hall, along with the other defenders of Hogwarts. Harry saved her and [[Seamus Finnigan]] with a [[Shield Charm]] when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] sent a [[curse]] their way. Hannah stood witness to Harry's final defeat of Voldemort, thus surviving the Second Wizarding War.

===Later life {{C|1998-2014}}===
{{Quote|Neville Longbottom, now a popular Herbology teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is here in Patagonia with his wife Hannah. Until recently the pair lived above the Leaky Cauldron in London, but rumour has it that Hannah has not only retrained as a Healer, but is applying for the job of Matron at Hogwarts. Idle gossip suggests that she and her husband both enjoy a little more [[Ogden's Old Firewhisky]] than most of us would expect from custodians of our children, but no doubt we all wish her the best of luck with her application.|[[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL]]|Pottermore}}
Having missed a year in education it is likely that, like [[Hermione Granger]], Hannah would resit the same year and they would graduate together in 1999.

Some time before [[2014]], Hannah married her former classmate and leader of the student rebellion, [[Neville Longbottom]]. She became the landlady at the [[Leaky Cauldron]], replacing [[Tom]], and the couple lived together above the pub. Neville's students considered the fact they lived above the pub "cool".

Hannah eventually gave up being landlady of the Leaky Cauldron and decided to train as a [[healer]]. She applied for the job of Matron at Hogwarts. On [[8 July]] [[2014]], [[Rita Skeeter]] scathingly reported that she and Neville enjoyed <nowiki>'</nowiki>''a little more Ogden's Firewhisky than most would expect from custodians of our children''<nowiki>'</nowiki>. Since Rita enjoyed fabricating information to slander people, it is likely that her statement was untrue.

==Physical description==
Hannah was described as a pink-faced girl with blonde hair. In her younger years, she usually wore pigtails.

==Personality and traits==
Hannah appeared to have a naive streak since she was easily convinced by Ernie that Harry might be the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]], despite having always considered him to be nice. She also believed that [[Sirius Black]] could turn into a flowering shrub (although, given that he was, in fact, an [[Animagus]], the belief wasn't too far from the truth).

Hannah was easily flustered and appeared to lack self-confidence, as was evidenced by her breakdown in [[Herbology]] and her claims of being stupid. It seemed that, when under pressure, she was prone to making mistakes. Despite this, Hannah was a loyal friend and showed her bravery firstly by joining [[Dumbledore's Army]], and then fighting in the defence of Hogwarts.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Hannah joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] in her [[fifth year]], and learned how to cast various defensive and offensive [[spell]]s, under the masterful teaching of [[Harry Potter]].
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Hannah helped retaliate against [[Draco Malfoy]] and his [[Draco Malfoy's gang|friends]] when they tried to gang up on and attack Harry Potter, where she and her friends managed to [[jinx]] and [[hex]] them into having the appearances of [[slug]]s. She also impressively fought in and survived the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], showing her to have been an excellent duellist with considerable proficiency in [[martial magic]].
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Hannah achieved a high mark on her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam. In her [[sixth year]] she attended N.E.W.T. Herbology classes, showing her proficiency in the subject.
*'''[[Healing magic|Healing]]''': In her adulthood, Hannah trained to become a [[Healer]] and applied for the position of the Hogwarts [[Matron]], meaning she would have been very accomplished and learned in healing magic, including with [[healing spell]]s, [[potion]]s and other magical remedies.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Hannah was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]. This is a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability, given how difficult the said charm is to perform. She likely learned how to cast the spell whilst attending Dumbledore's Army meetings. She was also likely gifted at teaching others about [[charm]]s, serving as a [[Charms Tutor]] in her [[fifth year]].

==Possessions==
*'''[[Wand]]''': Hannah owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. Like most witches and wizards in [[Great Britain]], she presumably purchased it from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]], [[London]], prior to starting her [[first year]] at Hogwarts in [[1991]]. She would have wielded her wand throughout her school life, and during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]].
*'''[[Leaky Cauldron]]''': After graduating from Hogwarts, Hannah eventually become the Landlady of the Leaky Cauldron, the popular wizarding pub in Diagon Alley, thus becoming its owner.
*'''[[Prefect badge]]''': Hannah owned a Hufflepuff Prefect badge, prior to becoming a [[Prefect]] at the start of the [[1995–1996 school year]], which she would have worn during her Prefect duties.
*'''[[Potter Stinks badge]]''': At the start of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] in [[1994]], Hannah owned and wore one of these enchanted badges to show her contempt for Harry Potter becoming the second Hogwarts champion, believing he was stealing [[Cedric Diggory]]'s limelight. She stopped wearing hers after becoming a supporter of Harry during the Tournament.

==Relationships==
===Neville Longbottom===
[[File:Neville Longbottom.jpg|272x272px|thumb|left|[[Neville Longbottom]], her future husband]]
Although it appeared that Hannah and Neville Longbottom were rarely ever together during their school days, and given that Hannah supported [[Cedric Diggory]] in their fourth year, their friendship probably evolved from their time in [[Dumbledore's Army]] together, and during the student rebellion during their seventh year, as well as just being in the same year and sharing classes for so long — particularly [[Herbology]], Neville's best subject, which the [[Gryffindor]]s shared with the [[Hufflepuff]]s.

It is possible that Hannah and Neville both found comfort in each other during their seventh year, since in the previous year Hannah's mother had been killed by [[Death Eaters]], and Neville would understand how she would be feeling as Death Eaters tortured his parents into [[insanity]]. Hannah joined Dumbledore's Army under the leadership of Neville, and in the absence of Harry, and proved her loyalty to him throughout the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

Following the [[Second Wizarding War]], Hannah and Neville became closer and eventually married. Neville became the new Professor of Herbology at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], taking over from [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]], whilst Hannah became the new landlady of the [[Leaky Cauldron]], taking over from [[Tom]]. The couple lived together above the pub, a fact that Neville's students thought was 'cool'.

Hannah eventually applied for the job of Matron at Hogwarts, which could have brought her closer to Neville, if she managed to gain the position.

===Ernie Macmillan===
[[File:Ernie GOF.jpg|251x251px|thumb|alt=|[[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], her friend and house mate]]
Hannah and Ernie Macmillan were close friends during their time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], both having been sorted into the house of [[Hufflepuff]] during their first year. During their second year they both discussed the possibility of Harry being the Heir of [[Slytherin]] after the Chamber of Secrets had been declared open. Hannah had her doubts, as she thought Harry was nice, but Ernie was easily able to sway her opinion.

Both Hannah and Ernie shared the hobby of collecting [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s. They also both supported [[Cedric Diggory]] as the School Champion during the [[Triwizard Tournament]], as many Hufflepuffs and even Ravenclaws did, and both shared a certain irritation with Harry Potter, the other champion. In [[1995]], they both became the [[Hufflepuff]] [[prefect]]s and joined [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Unlike Hannah, Ernie was able to keep his cool during his O.W.L.s.

===Justin Finch-Fletchley===
Hannah and [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]] were close friends during their time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], both having been sorted into the house of [[Hufflepuff]] during their first year. During their second year they both discussed the possibility of Harry being the Heir of [[Slytherin]] after the Chamber of Secrets had been declared open. Both Hannah and Justin joined [[Dumbledore's Army]].

===Susan Bones===
Hannah and [[Susan Bones|Susan]] were roommates and friends during Hogwarts, and sat together in the [[Hogwarts Express|train]] while going to Hogwarts. Both joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and both fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

==Etymology==
*'Hannah' is from the Hebrew name חַנָּה (Channah) which meant 'favour' or "grace'. Hannah was the mother of the prophet Samuel in the Old Testament. As an English name, Hannah was not regularly used until after the Protestant Reformation.

:*'Hannah' sounds almost identical to the Japanese word for flower, 花 (romanised 'Hana'). As such, it could be taken as part of the pattern of flower names, which includes [[Lily J. Potter]], [[Lily L. Potter]], [[Rose Granger-Weasley]], [[Fleur Delacour]], [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia Evans]] and others. However, it is very likely that this is simply a coincidence, given that the name is of Hebrew origin and means something else.
*'Abbott' is a Middle English surname. An abbot was a church position below the pope, archbishops and bishops in the Church hierarchy in the Middle Ages. The ancestors of people with the surname Abbott probably were abbots or abbesses in medieval times (900-1300).

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Da-hannah.jpg|150px|thumb|Hannah as she appears on {{PM}}]]
*During the [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]], Hannah Abbott was doing her [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] practical at the same time as [[Harry Potter]]. This is odd as the examinations are done by surname, meaning that Hannah should have finished a while earlier. One possible explanation is that the lists for that examination were mistakenly compiled by first name. Another is that Hannah's exam took an unusually long time, possibly due to her nerves.
*[[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] saw the grave of someone named '[[Abbott]]' when they visited [[Godric's Hollow]] in [[1997]]. This may have been the grave of a relative of Hannah's, perhaps indicating that her [[Abbott family|family]], like the [[Potter family|Potters]], come from Godric's Hollow.
*While Hannah's mother was revealed to be killed by the Death Eaters, her father's fate was left unknown, indicating that he was either alive or deceased by 1996. So, Hannah may have possibly been left an orphan after her mother's death. Alternatively, her father could have been the one who pulled her out of Hogwarts.
[[File:Hannahabbott.PNG|150px|thumb|Hannah Abbott as she appears in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|''Order of the Phoenix'' video game]]]]
*Hannah Abbott was portrayed by [[Charlotte Skeoch]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', as well as voicing the character for the game ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''. She was portrayed by [[Louisa Warren]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|film adaptations]] of {{DH}} in a background role.
*She is one of the Original Forty students listed by [[J. K. Rowling]] along with [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley]].
*From early production notes viewed in the [[2001]] television special, {{HPM}}, Hannah was supposed to be a [[Muggle-born]] witch. However, J. K. Rowling stated in an [[J.K. Rowling PotterCast Interview|interview]] that she always considered Hannah to be a [[pure-blood]]. To compromise, she was officially made a [[half-blood]].
*In the credits of {{COS|FA}}, she is listed as 'Hannah Hufflepuff'.
*In the [[Sorting ceremony|sorting]] scene in the {{PS|FA}}, [[Hermione Granger]] gets called up first instead of Hannah Abbott.
*An Alice Abbott was accused of witchcraft during the {{W|Northamptonshire witch trials}} of 1612.
