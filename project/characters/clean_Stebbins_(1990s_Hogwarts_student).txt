'''Stebbins''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1990s]].


A member of [[Hufflepuff]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]], he attended the [[Yule Ball]] with [[Fawcett]] of [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]]. They were caught, presumably kissing, in the [[rose]] bushes during the ball by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], and were each docked ten [[House points]].


*In a deleted scene from , Stebbins and [[Fawcett]] are caught, presumably kissing, in one of the [[Hogwarts Carriages]], which were parked in the [[Viaduct Courtyard|Entrance Courtyard]].
*In the [[Great Britain|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], Russian, Hebrew, Polish and Danish editions of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', when Snape catches Fawcett with Stebbins in chapter 23, he says, "Ten points from [[Hufflepuff]], Fawcett! And ten points from [[Ravenclaw]], too, Stebbins!", although Fawcett is referred to as a Ravenclaw by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in chapter 16. The American edition of the novel amends this error, with Snape taking Fawcett's points from Ravenclaw, and Stebbins' from Hufflepuff. In the ''Goblet of Fire'' film, however, Snape makes a similar error where he refers to Fawcett as a Hufflepuff and Stebbins as a Ravenclaw. The only way it couldn't be a mistake is that Snape mentions the consequences of the partner's rule-breakings.
