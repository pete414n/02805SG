{{Quote|Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come, when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.|Albus Dumbledore's eulogy to Cedric|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
'''Cedric Diggory''' ([[September]]/[[October]] [[1977]]–[[24 June]] [[1995]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was the son of [[Amos Diggory]] and [[Cedric Diggory's mother|his unnamed wife]]. He started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1989]], and was sorted into the [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]]. During his time at school, he was a [[prefect]] and captained the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team]], playing as [[Seeker]]. In his sixth year Cedric put his name forward to compete in the [[Triwizard Tournament]].

He was selected as the Hogwarts Triwizard Champion and, although overshadowed in the press by the entry of [[Harry Potter]], Cedric enjoyed almost overwhelming support from the student body, and after the first two tasks, tied with Harry for first place. Cedric and Harry completed the Third Task together. Both took hold of the [[Triwizard Cup]], which [[portkey|transported]] them to the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]], where Cedric was murdered by [[Peter Pettigrew]] with the [[Killing Curse]], on the orders of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].

During the following duel between Harry and Voldemort, Cedric's echo reappeared during ''[[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]]'', and helped the echoes of Harry's parents, [[Bertha Jorkins]], and [[Frank Bryce]] hold off Voldemort long enough for him to escape. His only request was for Harry to take his body back to his parents, which Harry honoured.

In [[2020]], Diggory's participation in the Triwizard Tournament and subsequent death was the subject of [[Albus Potter]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy]]'s [[Time-Turner|time-travel]] antics at the request of Amos. They sought to save Cedric and created an alternate timeline where Cedric survived and became part of the [[Death Eaters]], because of the humiliation they caused him when they tried to save his life. Cedric's original and heroic life and death was later restored.

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1977–1989}}===
Cedric was born in either [[September]] or [[October]] of [[1977]], to [[Amos Diggory]] and [[Cedric Diggory's mother|his wife]]. He grew up near [[Ottery St Catchpole]],<ref name="GF">{{GOF}}</ref> a small town located in [[Devon]], [[England]]. When he was seven years old, his father enjoyed bragging about him to the family friends, as well as anyone who would listen.<ref>{{HM|1|Party Planner}}</ref>

===Hogwarts years {{C|1989–1995}}===
{{Quote|I said to him, I said — Ced, that'll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will... you beat ''Harry Potter''!|[[Amos Diggory]] bragging about Cedric|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

====First year====
[[File:CedricDiggoryHM.png|150px|thumb|left|Cedric Diggory in his early school years]]
Cedric started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September]] [[1989]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]]. Soon after starting Hogwarts, Cedric became a popular student at the school, and people talked about him constantly.<ref name="HM66">{{HM|6|6}}</ref>

Cedric was known as a fair and kind Hufflepuff, and had started his first year by stopping a Gryffindor from teasing a Ravenclaw; he was popular from the start of his years in the school, as most of [[Jacob's sibling]]'s friends preferred to spend their time with him rather than helping Jacob's sibling search for [[Jacob]].<ref name="HM66"/>

[[File:Cedric and Penny with petrified Madam Pomfrey.jpg|250px|thumb|Cedric and [[Penny Haywood]] witnessing a petrified Madam Pomfrey]]
He was present when [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] was [[Petrification|petrified]], and later recounted the event to [[Albus Dumbledore]], [[Severus Snape]], [[Jacob's sibling]], and [[Penny Haywood]].<ref name="HM614">{{HM|6|14}}</ref>

After the [[Circle of Khanna]] was founded, Cedric's friend [[Ben Copper]], one of the founders of the group, invited him to join. Cedric spent much of his time in the group training [[duelling]] with Ben and [[Diego Caplan]].<ref name="HM620"/> One time during training, his arm was broken as a result of Ben casting a [[spell]] Cedric was not expecting, and he had to be sent to the [[Hospital Wing]]. He was soon [[Healing magic|healed]] by [[Chiara Lobosca]].<ref name="HM621">{{HM|6|21}}</ref>

He distinguished himself as both an academic and athletic student. At some point, he became [[Seeker]] of his house's Quidditch team.<ref name="PA">{{POA}}</ref>

====Fifth year====
{{Quote|Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain filled air between them...|Cedric Diggory playing Quidditch in his fifth year|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Harry and Cedric playing Quidditch.gif|250px|thumb|left|Cedric playing as Seeker for the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team]]]]
In [[1993]], Cedric became a [[Prefect]] and [[Quidditch Captain|Captain]] of the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team]]. On [[7 November]], he led his team against [[Gryffindor]] in the first match of the school year.<ref>{{POA|B|9}} - 'They've got a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory'</ref> Originally, the match should have taken place between Gryffindor and [[Slytherin]], but [[Draco Malfoy]] played on the fact that his arm had been injured by the [[hippogriff]] [[Buckbeak]] to get out of playing in stormy conditions. 

During the match, Cedric and Harry Potter contested the [[Golden Snitch]]. However, Harry was overcome by the presence of [[Dementor]]s and fell from his broom. Cedric caught the Snitch, but as soon as he realised what had happened to Harry, he immediately offered to replay the match. [[Oliver Wood]] was said to have declined the offer, feeling that Cedric had won the match fair and square.<ref name="PA" />

When Harry got back his [[Harry Potter's Firebolt|Firebolt broomstick]], Cedric was among those who congratulated Harry on his ownership of the broomstick.<ref name="PA" />

====Sixth year====
{{Quote|The Hogwarts Champion, is Cedric Diggory!|[[Albus Dumbledore]] announcing Cedric as a the Hogwarts Champion|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
In the summer of 1994, Cedric attended the [[Quidditch World Cup]] with his father, travelling to the game with the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], Harry Potter, and [[Hermione Granger]] as he and his father lived close to [[the Burrow]].<ref name="GF" />

[[File:Triwizard-Tournament-cedric.JPG|250px|thumb|Cedric enters the [[Triwizard Tournament]]]]
Cedric started his sixth year in September 1994, the same year that the Triwizard Tournament was reinstated. Being of age, Cedric submitted his name to the [[Goblet of Fire]] for the chance to become the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] Champion. On 31 October, the Goblet chose the champions to represent the three schools; [[Fleur Delacour]] for [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]], [[Viktor Krum]] for [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], and Cedric himself for Hogwarts.

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-screencaps.com-3797.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Cedric is selected as a champion by the Goblet of Fire]]
Cedric joined the other champions in a small room off the [[Great Hall]], and was surprised to learn that after he had left the Hall, the Goblet had produced a fourth name — [[Harry Potter]]. Harry claimed that he did not cheat and put his name in, and while no-one thought he was telling the truth, Cedric was kind to Harry. Cedric later asked Harry how he managed to cheat, and Harry again told him that he never cheated. Though Harry felt Cedric did not believe him, he remained kind and appeared to be okay with what Harry was telling him.<ref name="GF" />

=====Triwizard Champion=====
{{Dialogue a-b|Ollivander|Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn't it? Yes, I remember it well. Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn... must have been seventeen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches... ash.. pleasantly springy. It's in fine condition.... You treat it regularly?|Cedric Diggory|Polished it last night.|Cedric having Mr Ollivander examine his wand|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:The champions.png|250px|thumb|The champions shortly after they had been chosen to enter the [[Triwizard Tournament]]]]
In the weeks that followed his selection, Cedric was supported by the majority of the school, even the [[Slytherin]]s. Enchanted badges became popular around the school that read ''Support CEDRIC DIGGORY — the REAL Hogwarts Champion!'', then changed to read ''POTTER STINKS''. Cedric, however, was not fond of the badges and asked his friends not to wear them. 

As part of the Tournament, Cedric took part in the [[Wand weighing ceremony]] conducted by [[Garrick Ollivander]], who deemed [[Cedric Diggory's wand|his wand]] <nowiki>'</nowiki>''pleasantly springy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, and posed for photos for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. However, his entry into the Tournament was completely overlooked by [[Rita Skeeter]]'s article on the event in favour of Harry, a situation about which [[Amos Diggory|his father]] was most displeased.<ref name="GF" />

=====First Task=====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a-b|Harry Potter|Cedric, the first task is Dragons.|Cedric Diggory|What?|Dragons. They've got four, one for each of us, and we've got to get past them|Are you sure?|Dead sure. I've seen them.|But how did you find out? We're not supposed to know...|Harry informing Cedric about the first task|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
In the months before to the First Task, Cedric was informed by Harry that the first task was to get past a [[dragon]]. Cedric was the only Champion not to be aware of them, and Harry felt it was only fair to tell him so everyone would be on an even footing.<ref name="GF"/>

[[File:Dragon Enclosure Pottermore.png|250px|thumb|left|Dragons, the first task of the tournament]]
On [[24 November]], the Champions gathered and randomly selected miniature versions of a dragon with a number on them to indicate the order in which they would face them. Cedric drew the [[Swedish Short-Snout]] and the number one slot, so entered the arena first to attempt to retrieve the [[golden egg]] it was guarding. 

Facing the dragon, Cedric [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] a rock into a Labrador to distract the creature. While the dragon turned to chase the dog, Cedric went for the Golden egg. Although he retrieved it, the dragon lost interest in the dog, preferring to go after Cedric. The dragon burned Cedric on the side of his face, and he barely managed to get away from it. He was tended to by [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], who applied an orange paste to his face to heal the wound.<ref name="GF" />

=====Yule Ball and Second Task=====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Cedric Diggory|Listen... I owe you one for telling me about the dragons. You know that golden egg? Does yours wail when you open it?|Harry Potter|Yeah.|Well... take a bath, okay?|What?|Take a bath, and — er — take the egg with you, and — er — just mull things over in the hot water. It'll help you think.... Trust me. Tell you what, use the prefects' bathroom. Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password's 'pine fresh'. Gotta go... want to say good night —|Cedric returning Harry's previous favour|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Cedric cho gof promo.jpg|250px|thumb|Cedric attends the [[Yule Ball]] with Cho Chang]]
Like all the Champions, Cedric had to work out the clue hidden in the [[golden egg]] to prepare for the Second Task. He was aided by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], disguised as the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor [[Alastor Moody|Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody]], who told him to take it into the bath and listen to it underwater. He took it into the prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor, and opened the egg underwater. He heard the clue, but it took him a while to figure out that it referred to the [[merpeople]] in the lake.<ref name="GF" />

At Christmas, Cedric was required to attend the Yule Ball, a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament. He asked [[Cho Chang]]  (whom he either was already dating or subsequently began to) to attend the ball with him, and she accepted. Towards the end of the ball, Cedric found Harry and told him to take the egg into the bath and <nowiki>'</nowiki>''mull things over in the hot water''<nowiki>'</nowiki> as he had done. As repayment for warning him about the [[dragon]]s, he gave Harry access to the Prefect's Bathroom to work out the clue.<ref name="GF" />

[[File:Triwizard Champions before the Second Task.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Four Champions]]
On [[24 February]], the Second Task took place. Having deciphered the clue in the golden egg, Cedric knew he had to breathe underwater for at least an hour and retrieve something that had been stolen from him. He effectively employed the [[Bubble-Head Charm]], and reached the merpeople village shortly after Harry. He found that his something that he would <nowiki>'</nowiki>''sorely miss''<nowiki>'</nowiki> was Cho, and rescued her. He warned Harry — who was worried about the other 'hostages' — to hurry up, then swam to the surface. He arrived one minute outside the hour time limit, and received forty-seven points. After two tasks, he was tied for first place with Harry.<ref name="GF" />

=====Third Task=====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Cedric Diggory|You take it. You should win. That's twice you've saved my neck in here.|Harry Potter|That's not how it's supposed to work. The one who reaches the cup first gets the points. That's you. I'm telling you, I'm not going to win any races on this leg.|No.|Stop being noble. Just take it, then we can get out of here.|You told me about the dragons. I would've gone down in the first task if you hadn't told me what was coming.|Cedric offering Harry Potter victory in the maze|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Prior to the Third Task, Cedric, along with the other Champions, joined [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] to view the maze that was being grown on the Hogwarts [[Quidditch]] pitch. Along with Harry, Cedric was dismayed to see the Quidditch pitch overgrown, but was assured by Bagman that the pitch would be returned to normal following the conclusion of the Tournament.<ref name="GF" />

[[File:The Triwizard Maze PM.jpg|250px|thumb|The third task, the hedge maze]]
On [[24 June]], Cedric was joined by his parents, who had been invited to watch the Third Task. During the meeting, his father confronted Harry over the coverage he had been receiving in the press at the expense of his son. Cedric tried to calm him down and explain that it was not Harry's fault, then apologised to Harry.<ref name="GF" />

[[File:CedricDiggoryInTriwizardMaze Still.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Cedric after just entering the hedge maze]]
Because they were tied for first place, Cedric entered the maze with Harry. They split up, each hoping to be the first to get to the [[Triwizard Cup]] placed in the centre of the maze. Soon after, Cedric encountered one of [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s now gigantic [[Blast-Ended Skrewt]]s, and narrowly escaped being burned by it. After the Skrewt, Cedric came across [[Viktor Krum]]. Krum — who was under the [[Imperius Curse]] at the time — attacked Cedric with the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. He was saved by Harry, who stunned Krum, and reluctantly shot red sparks into the air to mark Krum's position, so that the Durmstrang champion could be retrieved from the maze. Despite being briefly united, he and Harry split apart again to seek the cup.<ref name="GF" />

[[File:Harry and Cedric in the maze.jpg|250px|thumb|Cedric and Harry inside the maze after the latter rescued him]]
Cedric spotted the cup, and sprinted towards it as fast as he could. From his left, an [[Acromantula]] burst onto the path and attacked him. His wand was knocked out of his hand, but the timely arrival of Harry distracted it enough for Cedric to recover his own wand. Although the giant spider was too powerful to be brought down by a single spell, Harry and Cedric both stunned it at the same time. Recovering, the two of them found themselves next to the Triwizard Cup.

Having been saved by Harry twice in the maze, Cedric urged him to take the Cup. The two argued about who should take it and win the Tournament, each pointing out that they had been helped by the other. Eventually, Harry suggested that they both take it for a Hogwarts victory. Pleased, Cedric helped the injured Harry towards the Cup, and they both took hold of it. Their touch activated the Cup, which had been turned into a [[Portkey]], and the two of them were transported away.<ref name="GF" />

=====Death=====
{{Quote|From high above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, <nowiki>'</nowiki>''kill the spare.''<nowiki>'</nowiki> A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night: <nowiki>'</nowiki>''[[Killing Curse|Avada Kedavra]]!''<nowiki>'</nowiki> A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to ground beside him. Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.|Harry witnessing [[Peter Pettigrew]] murdering Cedric|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Cedric's Death.gif|250px|thumb|left|Cedric's murder at the hands of Peter Pettigrew and Lord Voldemort]]
The Portkey deposited both Cedric and Harry in [[Little Hangleton graveyard|an unknown graveyard]]. Confused, Cedric recommended proceeding with wands out until they knew what was going on. Soon after their arrival, Peter Pettigrew emerged from the darkness carrying the small form of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. At this point Harry's scar hurt with intense pain, upon him being in close proximity to Voldemort. Voldemort ordered Pettigrew to <nowiki>'</nowiki>''Kill the spare''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, and he used Voldemort's own wand to murder Cedric with the [[Killing Curse]]. Harry heard Cedric's body hit the ground.<ref name="GF" />

===Post-mortem {{C|1995–2021}}===
====Assisting Harry Potter====
Although dead, Cedric still had a role to play in the night's events. After Voldemort was [[Return of Lord Voldemort|reborn]], he and Harry engaged in a [[Duel in Little Hangleton|duel]], during which their wands — which shared a wand core from [[Fawkes|the same phoenix]] — connected, creating the effect known as ''[[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]]'', the backward spell effect. Voldemort's wand began regurgitating the last spells it had cast in reverse.
[[File:Cedric Diggory's echo.jpg|250px|thumb|Cedric's echo asks Harry to take his body back to his parents]]
Cedric's shadow emerged from Voldemort's wand, along with the shadows of [[Frank Bryce]], [[Bertha Jorkins]], and [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]]. Cedric's 'echo' asked Harry to take his body back to his parents while he helped the others. Harry agreed, and when he broke the wand connection, the shadows advanced on Voldemort, shielding Harry. Harry used the opportunity to take hold of Cedric's body, then [[Summoning Charm|summon]] the Cup to himself and transport them both back to Hogwarts.<ref name="GF" />

====Legacy====
{{Quote|The Ministry of Magic, does not wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.|Albus Dumbledore speaking highly of the late Cedric Diggory|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Dead cedric.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry crying over Cedric's dead body after transporting them back to Hogwarts]]
Cedric's body was returned to the grounds, and Harry clung to it, refusing to let it go until [[Albus Dumbledore]] pulled him away. The crowd that had gathered for the Third Task erupted into screams when they realised what had happened, and Cedric's parents were grief-stricken by the fate that had befallen their son (although his mother attempted to console herself by reflecting that Cedric had not suffered in death, and that he had died after winning the Tournament, believing that the victory would have made him happy).<ref name="GF" />

{{Main|Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory}}
Cedric's death was widely felt throughout the school, and on [[26 June]] the Leaving Feast was turned into a memorial for him, with black banners replacing the house colours. Dumbledore delivered a tribute to Cedric, and relayed the events that had led to his death to the student body, telling them, against the explicit wishes of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], that the young Hufflepuff had been murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] himself.<ref name="GF" />

{{Dialogue a-b-a|Harry Potter|So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he?|Dolores Umbridge|Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.|It was murder. Voldemort killed him, and you know it.|Harry arguing with [[Dolores Umbridge]] over Cedric's death|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
The Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge refused to accept Harry Potter's claims that Lord Voldemort had returned, and tried to hush up Cedric's death, claiming that it was a freak accident during the Tournament that killed him. He also slandered Harry Potter as a liar and questioned [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s sanity.<ref name="OP">{{OOTP}}</ref>

In death, Cedric proved to be an inspiration to many students at Hogwarts. His death was heartfelt and was tragic enough to cause even those who disliked Harry to believe his claims of Voldemort's return. During the school year after Cedric's death, Hogwarts was under the watchful eyes of the [[British Ministry of Magic]] with [[Dolores Umbridge]], a high-ranking Ministry official being employed as [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher. She constantly told students that Harry lied about Cedric's death and refused to teach any practical magic.<ref name="OP" />

[[File:Cedric Diggory photograph.gif|250px|thumb|Cedric's photo, along with the original [[Order of the Phoenix]]'s, was stuck on the D.A.'s mirror as something to look at for inspiration]]
This started a rebellion amongst the students, and they formed [[Dumbledore's Army]], an alliance against Umbridge that taught students how to prepare themselves for the day that Lord Voldemort announced his return. During the D.A's meetings, Cedric was a key point of interest, with students wanting accounts of how he died, and his former girlfriend, Cho, seeking comfort from Harry, by asking whether Cedric would have survived if he had known what they were being taught. 

Harry, in turn, assured her that Cedric had known what he (Harry) was teaching the other students, but Cedric was simply unable to match Voldemort's experience and evil, and that Harry himself had made it back through good luck, rather than greater talent.<ref name="OPF">{{OOTP|F}}</ref> Later on that year, only when incontrovertible proof of the Dark Lord's return was presented, did Fudge believe Voldemort had indeed returned and that Cedric was actually murdered.<ref name="OP" />

Cedric was thereafter remembered as someone who had not strayed across the dark path and whom had stood up to Voldemort. Harry continued to honour him by keeping a badge that read 'Support Cedric Diggory'.<ref name="DH">{{DH|B|2}}</ref>

===Alternate timelines===
By [[2020]], Cedric's father, Amos, was still greatly grieving for his son's death. When he found out Harry Potter had retrieved a [[Time-Turner]], he begged Harry to use it to save Cedric. Harry stated that it was dangerous to meddle with time, but his own son, [[Albus Potter]], secretly agreed to it along with his friend, [[Scorpius Malfoy]]. Although they managed to create [[alternate reality|alternate realities]] (including one where Cedric lived), it changed time too much and they had to restore the original timeline. 

Indeed, the one timeline where Albus and Scorpius succeeded their goal of saving Cedric actually humiliated him in public, causing him to join the Death Eaters in bitter hatred for society; he ended up killing [[Neville Longbottom]], thus preventing [[Nagini]]'s death, which in turn [[Horcrux|prevented]] Voldemort from being killed, and Harry was killed in turn, thus leading to an age of darkness where Voldemort ruled. Albus and Scorpius prevented an attempt at changing time a third time by Delphi during the third task with the help of Cedric himself who rescued the two from the Dark witch, thinking that it was part of the task.

In [[2021]], Harry visited [[Cedric Diggory's grave|Cedric's grave]], which was placed on a beautiful hill. He shared this experience with his son, [[Albus Potter]], explaining that he came to say sorry for a life that was stolen and that he visits every year on the anniversary of Cedric's death. He tells Albus that Cedric was a great wizard and that he did not deserve his fate.<ref name="CC415">{{CC|B|4|15}}</ref>

==Physical description==
{{Dialogue a-b|Angelina Johnson|He's that tall, good-looking one, isn't he?|Katie Bell|Strong and silent.|A discussion regarding Cedric's physical appearance|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Normal HP shoot 1 001.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Cedric in his sixth year]]
Cedric was a tall and extremely handsome young man with chiselled features, dark hair, and bright grey eyes. Although he was a [[Seeker]] (a position usually taken by small and light players), he was well-built and burly.<ref name="PA" />

Because of his handsomeness, Cedric caught attention from numerous girls - [[Angelina Johnson]] commented that he was <nowiki>'</nowiki>''tall and good-looking''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, while [[Katie Bell]] agreed that he was <nowiki>'</nowiki>''strong and silent''<nowiki>'</nowiki>. Even [[Pansy Parkinson]], who usually had something negative to say about everyone's appearance, acknowledged his good looks. The fact that [[Fleur Delacour]] tried to use her Veela allure on him to charm him into becoming her date for the [[Yule Ball]] was further proof of how attractive he was.

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Amos Diggory|Ced's talked about you, of course. Told us all about playing against you last year.... I said to him, I said — Ced, that'll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will.... You beat Harry Potter!|Cedric Diggory|Harry fell off his broom, Dad. I told you... it was an accident....|Yes, but you didn't fall off, did you? Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman... but the best man won, I'm sure Harry'd say the same, wouldn't you, eh?

[[File:Cedric and friends laughing.gif|220x220px|thumb|Cedric laughing at [[Draco Malfoy]]'s expense]]

Cedric was said to be an embodiment of the qualities of [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]]. He had a sense of fair play: during the 1993 Gryffindor/Hufflepuff match, despite his capture of the [[Golden Snitch]] (which ensured his team's victory), Cedric immediately offered to replay the match once he found out that his opponent, Harry Potter, had fallen from his broom due to the influence of the [[Dementor]]s.<ref name="PA" /> 

Later on, he provided Harry with information as to how to decipher the [[golden egg]] clue for the Second Task. After Harry saved him in the maze, Cedric realised that Harry was the one who truly deserved to take the [[Triwizard Cup]], and had no qualms with openly acknowledging it, which actually resulted in an argument of sorts between them. This sense of fair play and his ability to accept there were those who were better than him is a definite testament to his nobility and his grace.

He also appeared to possess a strength of character that was not unlike Harry's. This came into play when Fleur's turning the force of her [[Veela]] charm on him while asking him to be her date for the Yule Ball. He refused, for he already had a date. Hence, it could be said that Cedric was a man of his word with remarkable inner strength, especially given how he was able to successfully resist the allure of Veela charm (which could be overwhelming) and keep his previously made promise.

Besides all this, Cedric was genuinely modest, telling [[Amos Diggory|his father]] that his victory in the Gryffindor/Hufflepuff Quidditch match had not been a truly fair one. All the female Gryffindor Chasers described him as being ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>strong and silent<nowiki>'</nowiki>'', suggesting that he was sensible enough to speak only when it was absolutely necessary. He was also courteously polite to foreigners: though he supported Ireland during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup final, he was still civil to Viktor Krum (who was from Bulgaria). The fact that his spirit's last request to Harry had only been to take his body back to his parents also proved that he loved his parents dearly.

While this side of him was never seen in the original timeline, he appeared to have a sense of honour and importance for his title at the school. This was proven by the fact that in one of the alternate timelines, in which he was humiliated during the Triwizard Tournament, this feeling of embarrassment eventually led him to join the Death Eaters. This means that if his pride or status had ever been shot down enough, this feeling of anger would have turned him over to the Death Eaters.

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour. We therefore award him forty-seven points.|[[Ludovic Bagman]] praising Cedric's impressive use of the [[Bubble-Head Charm]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

Given Cedric's relatively smooth and successful participation in the Triwizard Tournament, he was a skilful and competent wizard in his own right.<ref name="GF" /> He was also an accomplished [[Quidditch]] player.<ref name="PA"/>
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': As the Captain and [[Seeker]] of the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team]], Cedric was a skilful and accomplished flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, especially since the position of Seeker was generally considered to be the hardest position to play. In particular, he was noted to have a very fast swerve.<ref name="PA" /> He even defeated [[Harry Potter]] once in a match, although this had been due to the presence of [[Dementor]]s causing Harry to fall off his broom,<ref name="PA"/> but many still considered it an impressive display of his flying abilities.<ref name="GF"/>
{{Quote|You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground... turned it into a dog... he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration...|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] regarding Cedric's talent for transfiguration|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Cedric was shown to be proficient in transfiguration, given how he [[Transforming Spells|transformed]] a [[Rock to dog spell|rock into a dog]] during the first task of the Tournament, and took the [[Transfiguration (class)|subject]] at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level, meaning he must have achieved either an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' or '[[Outstanding]]' at [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]].<ref name="GF" />
[[File:Cedricbubble.jpg|200px|thumb|Cedric rescuing Cho Chang in the Great Lake using a Bubble-Head Charm]]
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Cedric was shown to be proficient in charm-work, using a successful [[Bubble-Head Charm]] during the second task of the Tournament, and took the [[Charms (class)|subject]] at N.E.W.T.-level, meaning he must have achieved either an 'Exceeds Expectations' or 'Outstanding' at O.W.L. level. He also used the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]] to illuminate his dark surroundings whilst navigating the maze of the Third Task, along with casting the [[Red Sparks]] to alert the defeat of [[Viktor Krum]].<ref name="GF" /> Furthermore, Cedric was shown to be very talented in the casting of defensive charms,<ref name="OPF"/> such as the [[Disarming Charm]] and [[Stunning Spell]];<ref name="GF" /> he was capable of using the Stunning Spell to stun and defeat an [[Acromantula]], a highly dangerous [[beast]] in the maze of the Third Task with [[Harry Potter]]'s help.<ref name="GF" />
*'''Indomitable willpower''': Cedric was shown to possess an exceptionally strong willpower that could rival that of [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s. For instance, he was able to successfully resist [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s [[Veela]] charm and honour his previous arrangement with [[Cho Chang|Cho]]. This was no easy feat, as Veela charm could be particularly powerful and Fleur seemed to be turning on the full force of it upon him.<ref name="GF" />

==Possessions==
[[File:Cedricdiggorywandnn8202.jpg|thumb|Cedric's wand]]
*'''[[Cedric Diggory's wand|Wand]]''': Cedric owned a [[wand]], which 12¼ inches long, made of [[Ash]] [[Wand wood|wood]] with a [[Unicorn hair]] [[Wand core|core]]. It was manufactured by the [[Wandmaker]] [[Garrick Ollivander]] and purchased from his wand shop [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]], prior to [[1988]]. It was described as being 'pleasantly springy' by Ollivander during the [[Wand weighing ceremony]] in [[1994]].
*'''[[Cedric Diggory's dress robes|Dress robes]]''': He owned formal black [[Dress robes]] that he wore to the [[Yule Ball]] with his date [[Cho Chang]].
*'''[[Prefect badge]]''': Having been made a Prefect in his [[fifth year]] at Hogwarts, Cedric owned a [[Hufflepuff]] Prefect badge, which he would have worn during his formal Prefect duties.
*'''''[[A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration]]''''': Being a [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level student of [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration class]], Cedric owned a copy of this advanced textbook which he kept in his school bag among his other books.
*'''[[Broomstick]]''': Being a successful and accomplished [[Quidditch]] of the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team]], Cedric would have owned his own broomstick which he would have flown with.

==Relationships==
===Amos Diggory===
{{Quote|A memorial? I am not interested in a memorial — not anymore. I am an old man — an old dying man — and I am here to ask you — beg you — to help me get him back.|An elderly Amos Diggory expressing his desire to see Cedric again to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child}}
[[File:Jeff Rawle as Amos Diggory (GoF-promo-03).jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Amos Diggory]], his father]]
Amos Diggory was immensely proud of his son and his achievements, especially when he beat [[Harry Potter]] during a [[Quidditch]] match in 1993, dismissing Cedric's insistence that Harry had fallen off his broom because of [[Dementor]]s just before Cedric caught the Snitch. During the [[Triwizard Tournament]], Amos was outraged that the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' completely overlooked the fact that Cedric was also a Hogwarts champion in favour of Harry Potter, and made no mention of him at all. Despite his son trying to point out that it wasn't Harry's fault, Amos countered by remarking that Harry hadn't done anything to correct them.<ref name="GF" />

After Cedric's death, Amos was overcome with grief. Along with his wife, he visited Harry in the hospital wing, and thanked him for bringing his son's body back, and assured Harry that he wasn't to blame for his son's death.<ref name="GF" />

===Cho Chang===
{{Quote|Well, obviously, she's feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. Then I expect she's feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can't work out who she likes best. Then she'll be feeling guilty, thinking it's an insult to Cedric's memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she'll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can't work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that's all very mixed up and painful.|[[Hermione Granger]] talking about Cho's sadness over Cedric's death|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:OOTP promo Cho cropped.jpg|200px|thumb|Cho Chang, his [[Yule Ball]] date and girlfriend]]
[[Cho Chang]] began dating Cedric as  late as when he asked her to be his partner for the [[Yule Ball]], and they, along with the other Champions and partners, opened the dancing at the Ball. During the Second Task, Cho was the 'something' that Cedric would "''sorely miss''", and was placed into a bewitched sleep. Taken beneath the waves of the lake to the Merpeople's village, Cedric rescued her. During the awarding of points for the Task, she gave him a glowing look. Cedric and Cho also went on a date at [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]] during the year.<ref name="GF" />

{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Who are you going with?|Cho Chang|Oh, Cedric. Cedric Diggory.|Cho Chang telling Harry Potter that she is going to the Yule Ball with Cedric|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}Cedric's death hit her hard, and she cried a lot over him.<ref name="GF" /> In the following year, she grew closer to Harry, and was confused by her feelings for him, and felt guilty over them. However, their relationship was not to last, as she soon began using their relationship to talk about Cedric and try to get some closure over his death, which ultimately failed as Harry disliked talking about it, and refused to, leading Cho to cry.<ref name="OP" />

===Harry Potter===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Cedirc Diggory|So. We're playing against each other again!|Harry Potter|I s'pose.|So... tell me... How did you get your name in?|I didn't. I didn't put it in. I was telling the truth.|Ah... okay. Well... see you, then.|Cedric being friendly towards Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:HBP promo side Harry cropped.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Harry Potter]], his friend and fellow champion]]
Cedric and Harry had a relationship of mutual respect and friendliness, though they were not close. In [[1993]], when [[Gryffindor]] and [[Hufflepuff]] played against each other in [[Quidditch]], Cedric offered to replay the match after Harry was incapacitated by [[Dementor]]s, though the Gryffindors refused, believing that Cedric caught the [[Golden Snitch]] fair and square.<ref name="PA" /> The [[1994|following year]], when Harry was selected as [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]' champion along with Cedric, Harry felt Cedric was sceptical of Harry's claims that he was not to blame, but he still disapproved of students wearing ''Support Cedric Diggory/Potter Stinks'' badges and discouraged it.

They assisted each other multiple times during the Tournament out of good sportsmanship, agreeing in the end that they were equally winners. Both of them touching the [[Triwizard Cup]] led to Cedric's murder, an event which haunted Harry for years. During Harry's duel with Voldemort, his spirit appeared to assist Harry when the two wands connected. He asked Harry to bring his body back to his parents. When the connection was broken, he and the other spirits that appeared distracted Voldemort to buy Harry enough time to escape to safety with his body.

{{Quote|Harry... take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my parents....|Cedric's echo to Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Harry risked his own life to fulfil Cedric's request and retrieve his remains. He nearly died as the Portkey was too far away to reach, forcing him to use a [[Summoning Charm]]. Harry would later use the death of Cedric (along with the deaths of his [[Lily J. Potter|mother]] and [[James Potter I|father]]) as added motivation when fighting Lord Voldemort.<ref name="GF" /> Cedric's death allowed Harry to see thestrals at the beginning of his fifth year. Harry avenged Cedric when he killed Voldemort at the end of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

===Pomona Sprout===
[[File:Professor Sprout.jpg|200px|thumb|Pomona Sprout, his [[Head of House]] and [[Professor]]]]
{{Quote|They are with Professor Sprout. She was Head of Cedric's house, and knew him best.|Albus Dumbledore in 1995, after Cedric Diggory's death|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Because Cedric Diggory was a [[Hufflepuff]] student, [[Pomona Sprout]] respected him. When [[Harry Potter]] became the second [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] champion in [[1994]], he felt that she had become distant with him as she was partial to Cedric because he was in [[Hufflepuff]].<ref name="GF" /> When Cedric Diggory was killed, she spoke to his parents, as she knew him best.<ref name="GF" />

==Etymology==
*The name [[Wikipedia:Cedric|Cedric]] was unintentionally created by Sir Walter Scott in his ''[[Wikipedia:Ivanhoe|Ivanhoe]]'' character Cedric the Saxon when he misspelt the name [[Wikipedia:Cerdic|Cerdic]]. Cerdic was a sixth-century Saxon leader and the first king of Wessex.
*It is commonly believed that [[J. K. Rowling]] borrowed Cedric's last name from Digory Kirke in C.S. Lewis's ''[[Wikipedia:The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]]'' series, as he is said to be one of her favourite authors.

*Cedric was portrayed by [[Robert Pattinson]] in {{GOF|FA}}. [[Joe Livermore]] portrayed Cedric in {{POA|FA}}.
*[[Tom Milligan]] portrays Cedric in {{CC|P1}}.<ref>[https://www.harrypottertheplay.com/cast/tom-milligan/ Tom Milligan on the official Harry Potter and the Cursed Child website]</ref>
*Cedric's death is the first death Harry witnesses in the book series. Harry was in his cot when his mother died, but he would not remember this due to his age at the time, and he passed out before he sees [[Quirinus Quirrell|Quirrell]] die. Yet, Harry is unable to see the [[Thestral]]s until {{OOTP}}, because the reality of Cedric's death has not fully sunk in. Technically, however, Harry did not witness the event at all in the books, as he was described to have his eyes closed with agony during Cedric's actual death.
*In {{POA|FA}}, Cedric, the [[Hufflepuff]] [[Seeker]] is struck by lightning during the [[Gryffindor]]-[[Hufflepuff]] match just as he is about to catch the Snitch, causing him to fall back. The player is not named in the film's dialogue, but 'Diggory' is embroidered above the Hufflepuff logo on his Quidditch robes, and the costume is identified as 'Cedric Diggory's Quidditch robes' in {{HPE}}.<ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=1377&pos=24 ''Harry Potter: The Exhibition'' photo] on SnitchSeeker.com</ref> However, it may have not been intended to be Cedric at the time, since in {{GOF|FA}}, Harry, along with Fred and George Weasley, do not show signs of knowing Cedric previously, as the film implies that they are first introduced to him on the way to the Quidditch World Cup; while in the novel they only knew him from the aforementioned Quidditch match against Hufflepuff in the previous school year.
**When Harry is cleaning out his school trunk in 1997, he finds a 'Support Cedric Diggory!' badge in there. Considering the badges were only created by [[Draco Malfoy]] to get a rise out of Harry in 1994, it seems out of place that Harry has it, although he may have it by accident, or out of respect for Cedric. He could also have kept one as a memento from the Tournament.
*Cedric once borrowed {{QTA|R}} from the [[Hogwarts Library]], and was due to return the book on [[3 July]].
*Although [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and Dumbledore say it was [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] who killed Cedric, it was actually [[Peter Pettigrew]], under Voldemort's orders, who killed him. It could be that they meant that Voldemort ''ordered'' Pettigrew to kill Cedric, which makes him equally responsible. It also should be noted that the wand Peter used to kill Cedric with was Voldemort's. In addition, they were likely simplifying the facts to address the relatively greater issue of Voldemort's return, and not to waste time explaining Pettigrew's defection and faking his own death.
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Cedric is not killed right away like in the novel and film. He is stuck to the statue with Harry, and participates in the ensuing battle. Rather, he is killed when Voldemort shoots a Killing Curse just as they grab the cup, which strikes Cedric and kills him. Despite Cedric's death in the graveyard, his [[Amos Diggory|father]] gets instructions on how to rebuild him from Dumbledore. However, in the [[LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7|sequel]], it is implied that Cedric is still dead, most likely to avoid creating a plothole surrounding the aftermath of his death and the [[Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]'s denial of Voldemort's return.
*Robert Pattinson has openly stated that he would rather want to play Cedric Diggory than playing [[Wikipedia:Edward Cullen|Edward Cullen]] from the ''[[Wikipedia:Twilight (series)|Twilight]]'' series.
*Despite being dead at the time, Cedric Diggory is an opponent in the [[Duelling Club]] minigame in the Nintendo DS version of ''LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7''.
*''[[Wikipedia:Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' star [[Wikipedia:Henry Cavill|Henry Cavill]] auditioned to play Cedric, but lost out to Robert Pattinson. He later lost out to Pattinson on playing [[Wikipedia:Edward Cullen|Edward Cullen]] in ''[[Wikipedia:Twilight (series)|Twilight]]'', despite being author [[Wikipedia:Stephanie Meyer|Stephanie Meyer]]'s first choice for the role.<ref>'[https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/06/henry-cavill-reveals-the-roles-he-didnt-get/ Henry Cavill Reveals the Roles He Didn't Get]'</ref>
*Hufflepuff is a house that is said to have produced the fewest Dark wizards. In an alternative timeline Cedric joined the Death Eaters and murdered Neville Longbottom. It's possible that due to the unique circumstances of Cedric's humiliation during the Triwizard Tournament and the overwhelming presence of the Death Eaters within the British Wizarding community created a situation where Cedric was easily influenced by the Dark Arts and the benefits that joining Lord Voldemort's elite could bring.
