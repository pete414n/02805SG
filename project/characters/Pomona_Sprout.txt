{{Quote|I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open. I feel that if a single pupil wants to come, then the school ought to remain open for that pupil.|Sprout's view on Hogwarts and education|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
'''Professor Pomona Sprout''' (b. [[15 May]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who worked as [[Head of Hufflepuff House]] and [[Professor|Head]] of the [[Herbology]] [[Herbology department|department]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She attended the school in her youth, where she was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]] and excelled at [[Herbology]]. Some time after her [[Seventh year|graduation]], Sprout returned to Hogwarts to teach.

In [[1993]], Professor Sprout grew the [[Mandrake]]s that would later be used in the [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]] to cure those who were petrified by [[Serpent of Slytherin|Slytherin's Monster]]. She also opposed [[Dolores Umbridge]] and her tyranny over the school in the [[1995–1996 school year]], which the rest of the staff were happy to join her in doing.

Sprout opposed [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the Second Wizarding War. She voted for the school to remain open after the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], and assisted in [[Ousting of Severus Snape|ousting Severus Snape]] in [[1998]]. She later took a group of students to the battlements during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and threw [[Devil's Snare]] and various other dangerous plants onto the invading [[Death Eaters]].

She ultimately survived the war. By the early [[21st century]], [[Neville Longbottom]] taught Herbology, alongside her. By summer 2020, Professor Sprout had formally retired from her position as professor of Herbology.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Hogwarts boats 1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|First years approaching [[Hogwarts Castle]] to begin their magical education]]
Pomona Sprout was born into a wizarding family of unknown degree on [[15 May]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] or [[Ireland]]. She presumably purchased her wand from [[Diagon Alley]] at the age of eleven, prior to attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

She was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]] and likely achieved a high-graded [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] and [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] in the subject.

Pomona and [[Minerva McGonagall]]'s student time at Hogwarts overlapped by two years. The two students enjoyed an excellent relationship both then and in later years. She felt homesick until her friend Minerva helped her get used to the school. They also helped each other learn the subjects they eventually taught. During her time at Hogwarts, she enjoyed attending Quidditch matches. 

===Career at Hogwarts===
====Earlier years====
{{Quote|Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here — compost in the sacks over there — and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula, it's teething.|Professor Sprout teaching a class|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Madam Sprout 2.jpg|250px|thumb|Professor Sprout teaching her second-year class how to re-pot [[Mandrake]]s]]
At some point after her graduation, Sprout returned to Hogwarts as a member of the [[Herbology department]]. At an unknown time, Professor Sprout became Head of Department and [[Head of Hufflepuff House]].

Professor Sprout used to bring the most interesting specimens (some of which could dance and talk) from the [[Hogwarts greenhouses|Herbology greenhouses]] to decorate [[Hufflepuff Basement]]. This was one of the reasons why Hufflepuffs were often very good in her subject.

====1980s/1990s====
[[File:Professor Sprout awarding Prefect duties HM.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sprout rewarding one her Hufflepuff students with Prefect duties]]
Professor Sprout was [[Nymphadora Tonks]]'s [[Head of House]] in the late [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]]. Sprout did not make her a prefect in her fifth year due to what Sprout deemed an inability to behave herself. However, Tonks presumably surprised Sprout after she earned at least five [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.Ts]] in her seventh year.

Sometime in between [[1987]] and [[1990]], [[Gabriel Truman]], a [[third year]] at the time, got into a [[Duelling|duel]] with a [[Ravenclaw]] [[Prefect]] who argued that the famous [[Arithmancer]] [[Bridget Wenlock]] must have been in his own house, not Hufflepuff, as she was in fact. Gabriel felt he deserved a week's worth of detentions for his own actions, but Professor Sprout went easy on him, sending him off with a warning and a box of [[Pink Coconut Ice|coconut ice]].

====[[1986–1987 school year]]====
{{Dialogue|[[Jacob's sibling]]|If that wasn't a werewolf, what was it?|Professor Sprout|A Boggart. Nasty shapeshifting creature. It takes the form of the victim's greatest fear. Boggarts are defeated by laughter, so you cast ''Riddikulus'' to change it into something humorous. To my knowledge, a Boggart has never been seen in the [[Hogwarts greenhouses|greenhouses]]... I must report this to Professor Dumbledore. Class dismissed.|Professor Sprout in response to a Boggart manifesting in the [[Herbology Classroom]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
[[File:Professor Sprout looking concerned HM31h.png|thumb|250px|right|Professor Sprout expressing concern after witnessing a boggart in the greenhouses]]
Professor Sprout spent the summer holidays of [[1986]] experimenting with [[dragon dung fertiliser]], which she told [[Jacob's sibling]] about during the first Herbology lesson of term. She then set the class to work on tending to [[valerian]] sprigs, which were a basis for many potions. Towards the end of the class, Professor Sprout asked [[Penny Haywood]] to fetch her a plant pot, only for the girl to scream in terror when a [[werewolf]] suddenly burst out of the stack.

The rest of the class began to panic as well, but Professor Sprout stepped forward and cast the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]] with [[Pomona Sprout's wand|her wand]], revealing that the supposed werewolf was actually a [[Boggart]]. Professor Sprout explained to the class what a Boggart was before dismissing them to go and speak to [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], as a Boggart had never appeared in the Herbology Greenhouses before.

Also during this year, she provided some [[earmuffs]] to Jacob's sibling and [[Penny Haywood]] in the [[Herbology Classroom]], so they could uproot a [[Mandrake]] in order to extract a hidden [[Chocolate Frog Card]] in its soil.

At some point during this school year, whilst [[Jacob's sibling]] was helping their friend [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] with Career Advice, Professor Sprout tasked Bill with teaching Jacob's sibling how to grow [[Leaping Toadstool]]s in the Herbology Classroom to see if he was suited to becoming a [[Herbologist]]. Unfortunately, Jacob's sibling Leaping Toadstools were of poor health and unable to jump, but Professor Sprout did not discourage them, telling them all good Herbologists made mistakes before making discoveries.

====[[1987–1988 school year]]====
During the 1987–1988 school year, when a [[Dementor]] was spotted on Hogwarts grounds which [[R's Dementor attack at Hogwarts Castle|attacked]] [[Penny Haywood]] and sent her to the [[Hospital Wing]], Professor Sprout met with Dumbledore with the the other [[Head of House]] in the [[Headmaster's office]] to discuss the incident. [[Jacob's sibling]] attended the meeting and informed them that the attack was instigated by "[[R]]", a cabal of [[Dark Wizard]]s.

[[File:Professor Sprout approaching Penny and Jacob's sibling HM.png|thumb|left|250px|Professor Sprout approaching Penny Haywood and Jacob's sibling in the Herbology Classroom]]
Also during this school year, Sprout took the [[Mirror of Erised]] from the castle without anyone's else's prior knowledge to the [[Herbology Classroom]], so she could look into it and see her heart's desire, after she failed to grow an ailing [[Puffapod]]. Jacob's sibling and Penny Haywood found the Mirror in the classroom whilst on their mission to locate it for Dumbledore, and Sprout appeared and admitted to taking the Mirror, and expressed regret over having caused any upset over it being missing. Sprout and Jacob's sibling went to speak with Dumbledore in his office, where Sprout told them of her intentions and how she had seen herself in a greenhouse surrounded by flourishing plants in the Mirror. She and Dumbledore returned to the classroom to retrieve the Mirror, but to their confusion found it missing, and Jacob's sibling went to find it again.

Also during this school year, she allowed Jacob's sibling before the start of a Herbology lesson take some [[Lady's Mantle]] from the Herbology Classroom so they could brew a [[Beautification Potion]], after informing them to seek [[Rubeus Hagrid]] for [[Ginger|ginger root]] from his [[Hagrid's Garden|garden]] as she had not grown any to give at the time, despite sometimes growing it for the [[Hogwarts house-elves]] and [[Severus Snape]]. Another time, Sprout taught Jacob's sibling, [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] and [[Liz Tuttle]] how to cultivate [[Bubotuber]]s in the Herbology Classroom, in preparation for the [[Forbidden Forest]].

On [[14 February]] [[1988]], Sprout taught [[Fourth year|fourth-year]] students how to use the [[Herbivicus Charm]] to accelerate the growth of red [[rose]]s for [[Valentine's Day]].

====[[1988–1989 school year]]====
[[File:Sprout creating a local rainstorm.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Professor Sprout creating a rainstorm in the Herbology Classroom]]
During the [[1988–1989 school year]], Jacob's sibling and [[Liz Tuttle]] came to her in the Herbology Classroom and requested she create a local rainstorm inside the classroom so an [[Augurey at the Magical Creatures Reserve|Augurey]] could fly. She created the rainstorm with ''[[Meteolojinx Recanto]]'' after the students sprayed some [[Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent]] on some [[Flesh-Eating Slug]]s that were attacking [[Mandrake]]s.

Also during this year, while reviewing plants with [[Fifth year|fifth-year]] students in preparation for their upcoming [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s, Jacob's sibling asked Sprout about gathering seeds from a [[Venomous Tentacula]], which she informed was both highly difficult and dangerous, informing them they were a [[Non-Tradeable Material|Class C Non-Tradeable Substance]].

====[[1989–1990 school year]]====
During the [[1989–1990 school year]] at Hogwarts, Sprout grew [[sage]], [[dittany]] and [[lavender]] in the greenhouses, which she gave to [[Jacob's sibling]] to give to the [[centaur]]s in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. She explained the various [[magic]]al properties of each plant to the student.

She also attended the [[memorial ceremony for Rowan Khanna]] held in the [[Great Hall]], in honour of [[Rowan Khanna]] following their [[death]], where she followed Professor Dumbledore's lead in raising her wand in honour of the fallen student.

Also during this school year, she ran out of [[Regerminating Potion]], to which [[Severus Snape]] had his [[Sixth year|sixth-year]] [[Potions (class)|Potions]] brew the potion for her in class.

====[[1990–1991 school year]]====
During the [[1990–1991 school year]], in response to an invasion of [[Doxy|Doxies]] that was swarming [[Hogwarts Castle]] and sending lots of students to the [[Hospital Wing]] with [[Doxy venom|venomous doxy bites]], Professor Sprout sought to help the situation by growing [[cowbane]], [[hemlock]] and [[tormentil]] in the greenhouses, the ingredients for [[Doxycide]], so it could be brewed and used to eliminate the doxies. She had [[Jacob's sibling]], [[Chiara Lobosca]] and [[Barnaby Lee]] harvest these plants in the [[Herbology Classroom]].

====[[1991–1992 school year]]====
{{Quote|Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes the dark and damp.|Hermione about one of Professor Sprout's Herbology lessons|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Devil's Snare.jpg|250px|thumb|Sprout's chamber and obstacle protecting the [[Philosopher's Stone]]|alt=]]
Professor Sprout was still teaching at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] by the [[1991–1992 school year]]. Just before the start of the new school year, [[Albus Dumbledore]] trusted her to contribute to the defences of the [[Underground Chambers#Sixth|Philosopher's Stone Chambers]]. Sprout, being the [[Herbology]] [[professor]], possessed considerable knowledge of plants and thus planted a large amount of [[Devil's Snare]] in her Chamber. The Devil's Snare in the chamber broke the fall of the one trying to get the Stone, but also tried to kill them. As the dangerous plant liked the dark and damp, the trick was to use [[fire]] or [[Lumos Solem Spell|sunlight]] to force the Snare into retreat. If the victim struggled, however, the plant would tighten its grip until they were dead.

[[File:Watching Quidditch.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sprout attending a Hogwarts Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin]]
That year, she taught her first years three times a week in [[Greenhouse One]] and taught them how to care for various herbs and fungi. Sprout also lectured her students about specific plants, such as [[Devil's Snare]]. 

That year, Sprout met the famous [[Harry Potter]] who was among the first-years she taught.

====[[1992–1993 school year]]====
{{Quote|We will be able to cure her, Argus. Professor Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs Norris.|Professor Sprout's Mandrakes|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Greenhouses.png|250px|thumb|Sprout teaching her second year students in front of the greenhouses]]
As the [[Herbology]] teacher, Professor Sprout was in charge of doctoring the damaged [[Whomping Willow]] by wrapping bandages around the broken branches after [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] drove [[Flying Ford Anglia|a bewitched car]] into it. On the first day of term, [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor|teacher]], gave her useless pointers and arrogantly made out that he was a better [[Herbologist]] than her, which made her look distinctly cross and not at all her usual cheerful self. 

She was further irritated when Lockhart took Harry out of the lesson to speak to him, rudely closing the door in her face before she could make her opinion known. That day she taught her second years how to re-pot a new growth of Mandrake, whilst also warning them about the teething [[Venomous Tentacula]], giving the plant in question a sharp slap to make it withdraw the long feelers it had been inching over her shoulder. This lesson and the Mandrakes would later prove to be very useful.

[[File:Harry-potter2-professorsprout.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sprout and others observing the message written on the wall by the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]]]]
Sprout and her colleagues were understandably unnerved by the [[Plot to open the Chamber of Secrets|opening]] of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. After [[Mrs Norris]], the [[cat]] belonging to [[Argus Filch]], was found [[Petrification|petrified]], Professor Dumbledore decided that they were to use a [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]] to cure her. Professor Sprout was put in charge of maturing her Mandrakes until they could be chopped up, [[Stewed Mandrake|stewed]], and used by [[Potions Master]] [[Severus Snape]] for the draught.

Sprout attended the Quidditch match between the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|Gryffindor]] and [[Slytherin Quidditch team|Slytherin teams]], sat high up in the stands with [[Potions Master]] Severus Snape, [[Charms Master]] [[Filius Flitwick]], [[Hogwarts Library|librarian]] [[Irma Pince]] and [[Hogwarts Board of Governors|Governor]] [[Lucius Malfoy]].

When the Hogwarts faculty were informed of [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]'s abduction into the [[Chamber of Secrets]] in the [[staffroom]], Sprout was utterly horrified, clasping her shaking hand over her mouth. When [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] entered the staffroom, Sprout and the other professors goaded Lockhart to enter the Chamber and rescue Ginny, knowing perfectly well he was a cowardly fraud who would soon flee the school, much to their delight. After that, McGonagall ordered her and the other two Heads of Houses to inform their students that the school was scheduled to close due to the kidnapping. However, as [[Harry Potter]] thankfully rescued her alive from the Chamber the same day, the school was kept open.

[[File:Dps table.PNG|250x250px|thumb|Sprout at the End-of-Term Feast, sitting next to [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]]|alt=]]
By the end of the year the Mandrakes had reached maturity and the Mandrake Restorative Draught was completed and administered to those who were petrified: [[Mrs Norris]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Colin Creevey]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Penelope Clearwater]], and the ghost of [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington]]. At the [[End-of-Term Feast]], Professor Dumbledore and the rest of the school applauded Sprout for her contribution in the brewing of the Mandrake Draught. During the End-the-Term Feast, Gryffindor also won the House Cup for a second year in a row and Hagrid returned from his confinement in [[Azkaban]].

====[[1993–1994 school year]]====
{{Quote|Careful, Weasley, careful!|Sprout, as [[Ronald Weasley]] drops his Puffapod|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Sprout HP.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sprout at the End-of-Term Feast next to Madam Pomfrey]]
The next school year was relatively uneventful at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. On [[16 October]], the [[Gryffindor]]s and [[Hufflepuff]]s had [[Herbology]] class together, and Sprout taught them how to harvest [[Puffapod]] beans. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] accidentally dropped some of these beans onto the floor of the [[Greenhouse Three|greenhouse]] they were working in and they instantly bloomed, earning him Professor Sprout's disapproval. During the same year, [[Sirius Black]], a "''dangerous mass-murderer''", escaped from [[Azkaban]] and tried to get into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] on two occasions.

On Christmas, Pomona Sprout was one of the thirteen Christmas Feast attendants. During the Christmas feast she was privy to the tense conversation between McGonagall and [[Sybill Trelawney|Trelawney]].

[[File:PomonaSprout bologyGreenhouse.jpg|250px|thumb|Sprout in her greenhouse teaching students|alt=]]
At the Start-of-Term Feast of the 1994-1995 school year, Professor Sprout sat next to the [[Astronomy]] [[Professor]] [[Aurora Sinistra]], with whom she spoke.

In the first lesson of the school year, Sprout taught her fourth year students how to squeeze pus from Bubotubers. Some of these students found this to be disgusting and [[Seamus Finnigan]] was not sure he heard her correctly. By the end of the lesson, each student had collected several pints. Sprout then gave the pints to the school's matron [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], since it could be used to treat acne.

At some point early on in the school year, Professor Sprout told [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Bartemius Crouch Jnr]] (impersonating the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor|teacher]] [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Alastor Moody]]) how good [[Neville Longbottom]] was at [[Herbology]]. "Moody" then lent Neville some books on plants and fungi called ''[[Magical Mediterranean Water-Plants and Their Properties]]'' and another called ''[[Magical Water Plants of the Highland Lochs]]''.

[[File:Weird Sisters playing at the Yule Ball.png|250px|thumb|left|The [[Yule Ball]] that Sprout attended in December 1994]]
That school year the [[Triwizard Tournament]] was held at [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] and one of the Triwizard Champions was sixth year [[Hufflepuff]] [[Cedric Diggory]], whom Sprout knew very well. On Christmas Day, Professor Sprout attended the Yule Ball where she danced with [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]].
[[File:B4C37M1 Great Hall mourning Cedric's death.png|250px|thumb|Professor Sprout attends [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory's memorial feast]]]] 
At the end of the year Cedric Diggory was murdered during the third task of the Triwizard Tournament on [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s orders. Harry Potter at the risk of his own life brought Cedric's body back to the school grounds. Sprout spoke with [[Amos Diggory]] and his wife, since she knew their son best as [[Head of Hufflepuff House|Head of his House]]. and believed Harry and Dumbledore's claims that Lord Voldemort had returned.

===Second Wizarding War {{C|1995–1998}}===
====[[1995–1996 school year]]====
{{Quote|The teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational Decree Number Twenty-Six, but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same. Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering can.|Professor Sprout after Harry's interview in ''[[The Quibbler]]''|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
The following school year, [[Dolores Umbridge]] was made Professor of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in accordance to the [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Two]]. Umbridge was despised by the majority of the staff, including Sprout. When Umbridge interrupted Professor Dumbledore's welcoming speech in the middle of the Start-of-Term feast, Sprout was taken-aback and scandalised at the audacity, raising her eyebrows high enough that they disappeared into her hairline. During Umbridge's speech she was observed as exchanging a significant look with Professor McGonagall, both of them understanding the message that lay beneath the officious and flowery rhetoric. 

[[File:Pomona_sprout.PNG|245px|thumb|left|Professor Sprout doing mock O.W.L.s with [[Harry Potter]]]]
The [[Gryffindor]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]-level class was lectured by Professor Sprout on the importance of the examinations during their first Herbology class. Sprout also had the students make a practical exercise which involved using dragon dung fertiliser. She also set them a long essay for the following lesson.

Sometime this year, Sprout held career consultations with her [[Hufflepuff]] fifth years. During this school year, Professor Sprout also held mock O.W.L.s on the Herbology Greenhouses for those wanting to revise for the exams.

After Harry Potter took part in an interview for ''The Quibbler'' about the events at [[Little Hangleton]] the previous June, he was put in detention by [[Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]. The rest of the teaching staff, however, found the interview an act of bravery on Harry's behalf and, being forbidden of discussing it per the [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Six]], found other ways to express their feelings; Pomona awarded Harry twenty [[house points]] for [[Gryffindor]] for passing her a [[watering can]].

[[File:Sprout in the game, Order of the Phoenix.JPG|250x|thumb|Pomona Sprout in the [[Hogwarts greenhouses|Herbology Greenhouses]]]]
The teachers' capability of teaching was examined by Umbridge, as part of her duties as High Inquisitor. [[Sybill Trelawney]], the [[Divination (class)|Divination]] Professor, was sacked and almost dragged out of the castle by Umbridge. [[Albus Dumbledore]], finding a loophole in one of the [[Educational Decree]]s, allowed the sacked Trelawney to remain occupying her premises on the North Tower. Trelawney was escorted back to the Castle by Sprout, [[Minerva McGonagall]] and [[Filius Flitwick]].

When [[Azkaban escapes|a mass breakout]] from [[Azkaban]] was announced in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', Sprout read the article in the Great Hall on the subject with great consternation, and was so intent on doing so that she failed to notice she was dripping [[egg]] yolk into her lap from her breakfast spoon.

Sprout managed to show Professor Umbridge her teaching capability and avoided being sacked herself. She would have been relieved to have Umbridge removed from the school at the end of the school year, and would have welcomed Professor Dumbledore back as Headmaster.

====[[1996–1997 school year]]====
{{Dialogue a-b|Horace Slughorn|… I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona. Most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.|Sprout|Oh, I quite agree. That enough for you?|A conversation at the vegetable patch|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Harry-potter2-sprout.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sprout in her Greenhouse teaching N.E.W.T. students]]
While giving out the student timetables on [[2 September]], Professor McGonagall remarked that Sprout was going to be delighted to see [[Neville Longbottom]] back with an '[[Outstanding]]' [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in [[Herbology]] that school year. To start off the year, she taught her sixth years about various extremely dangerous plants. She also permitted them to swear loudly if the [[Venomous Tentacula]] bit them or seized them unexpectedly from behind.

Not long after, Sprout had her sixth year class harvesting [[Snargaluff]] pods. She chided [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] for being slow; as they were still strapping on their protective gear (and talking), while [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] had already harvested his first pod. The trio's first pod bounced free while they were trying to open it, and rebounded off the glass roof of the greenhouse, knocking Professor Sprout's battered hat off.

In late April of that school year, Sprout helped the new [[Potions Master]], Horace Slughorn in picking some potion herbs. She left towards her [[Hogwarts greenhouses|Greenhouses]] after she had collected enough for Slughorn's third year class, with some to spare. Slughorn also proceeded to steal some Venomous Tentacula leaves while Sprout was not around.

[[File:Funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|[[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]]]]
At the end of the year, the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] took place, with the [[Death Eaters]] invading [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and fighting against the students, teachers, [[Auror]]s and the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Professor Sprout likely participated, as did [[Minerva McGonagall]], [[Filius Flitwick]], and [[Rubeus Hagrid]].

After Professor Dumbledore's death, Sprout met with fellow staff members Minerva McGonagall, Filius Flitwick, Horace Slughorn, and Rubeus Hagrid to discuss the future of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She was a staunch advocate of keeping the school open, stating that Dumbledore would have wanted it so. She also supported the suggestion that Dumbledore should be laid to rest at Hogwarts, though no Headmaster had ever received a burial there before.

Sprout attended Dumbledore's funeral and led the Hufflepuffs down to the grounds where the ceremony was held, looking cleaner than she ever had been before; without a single patch on her usually battered hat.

====[[1997–1998 school year]]====
[[File:Harry-potter7-nurses.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sprout in the Great Hall during Snape's reign as Headmaster]]
On 1 August, 1997 the [[Ministry of Magic]] was taken over by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]]. By the next school year, Severus Snape was made Headmaster of Hogwarts while his fellow Death Eaters, [[Alecto Carrow]] and [[Amycus Carrow]] became the [[Muggle Studies]] and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor|teachers]] respectively. Despite the school now in the grasp of Lord Voldemort, or perhaps because of it, Professor Sprout returned to the castle to teach and protect the students.

The Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, though Sprout and the staff never sent students to them if they could avoid it. She also, with the other [[Head of House|Heads of House]], tried to protect the pupils from Alecto and Amycus.

=====Battle of Hogwarts=====

One night, after being woken up by Minerva McGonagall's [[cat]] [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], Professors Sprout, [[Filius Flitwick|Flitwick]] and [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]], and, still in their night-clothes, went to find out what she wanted. They found [[Minerva McGonagall]] duelling Snape to the death, and, after being defeated, Snape then ran into a classroom, chased by Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall, and flew out of the window, escaping them.

Aware that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] would soon attack the castle, Sprout and the other professors set to defend the school and the students, noting that they could at least hold him up if not keep him out entirely and expressing a desire to see how the Death Eaters fared in combat with her deadly plants.

[[File:Flitwick Sprout Slughorn.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Pomona having a cup of tea with Flitwick and Slughorn]]
During the hour-long break in the Battle, Sprout helped treat wounded fighters in the [[Great Hall]]. Sprout also witnessed the duel between [[Harry Potter]] and Lord Voldemort in the Great Hall. During which Voldemort's spell rebounded on him and Harry emerged the victor. After the duel Sprout, Flitwick, and McGonagall all reached to hug Harry at the same time, while everyone else joined in. 

A celebration feast was later held, but no one sat in their proper house tables; teachers, parents and students were all jumbled up and chatting among themselves. Sprout sat by Filius Flitwick and Horace Slughorn, chatting and drinking a cup of [[tea]].

Sprout remained teaching at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as [[Herbology]] [[professor]]. By [[2008]],{{MATimeRef}} her former student [[Neville Longbottom]] had joined the [[Herbology department]] and taught the subject alongside her. She oversaw at the [[Sorting Ceremony]] at the beginning of the [[2008–2009 school year]] with her fellow [[Head of House|Heads of House]], including Neville who had become the [[Head of Gryffindor House|Head of Gryffindor]]. 

During the [[Calamity]], she was able to give twenty-three six-hours classes regarding everything she knew about Herbology and herbal remedies to members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] for increased recovery, and co-teach along with Professor Flitwick on how different magical approaches — when combined with teamwork — achieve devastating effects to enhance the efficiency of enchantments cast on a teammate.

By summer 2020, Professor Sprout had formally retired from her position as professor of Herbology.

{{Quote|Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes, and her fingernails would have made [[Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] faint.|A description of Professor Sprout in [[1992]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
Professor Sprout was described as being a squat little witch with short, grey, wavy hair. She usually wore a patched and battered hat. Her clothes were noted to almost always be covered in dirt and earth, and her fingernails were noted to be so filthy they would have made prim and proper [[Petunia Dursley]] faint in horror. Sprout also almost always had a smile on her face.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Quite enough chat over here! [[Trio|You’re]] lagging behind, everybody else has started, and [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]]’s already got his first [[Snargaluff|pod]]!|Professor Sprout's no-nonsense attitude as a teacher|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Professor Sprout was noted to be very cheerful, positive, and loyal, Sprout was also the most maternal of all the [[Head of House|Heads of House]], an example being when she calmed and got all of the students back to bed after the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]].

{{Quote|[[Harry Potter|He]] was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing [[earmuffs]] and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.|Sprout's bravery during the Battle of Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}She also seemed horrified when she learnt that [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] had been kidnapped by [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]] and taken into the [[Chamber of Secrets]], clasping her shaking hand over her mouth in shock. Professor Sprout was also very brave, always ready to fight for her side. During the Battle of Hogwarts, she did not question McGonagall's decision to defend Hogwarts and immediately sought to provide whatever assistance she could, collecting various dangerous plants to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters, showing her utmost loyalty and dedication for defending her school and standing up for what is right.

==Magical abilities and skills==

{{Quote|Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow. But I don't want you running away with the idea that I am better at Herbology than she is!|[[Gilderoy Lockhart]] arrogantly underestimating Professor Sprout's abilities in [[1992]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
As the [[Head of Herbology]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], [[Professor]] Sprout was an accomplished and skilful [[Herbologist]], as well as a powerful witch in her own right. Testaments to her considerable abilities were her proficiency in the subject she taught, and her participation of and survival of the legendary [[Battle of Hogwarts]].
{{Quote|We'll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?|Professor Sprout teaching second year Herbology|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
*'''[[Herbology]]''': As the [[Professor]] of [[Herbology]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Sprout was a very accomplished [[Herbologist]]. Her talents ranged from taking care of harmless plants, such as [[Umbrella Flower]]s, to more dangerous ones, such as [[Whomping Willow]]s, [[Mandrake]]s, [[Snargaluff]]s, [[Venomous Tentacula]]s and even the highly lethal [[Devil's Snare]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': As the Professor of Herbology, Sprout was well versed in [[Herbology]]-related charms, such as the [[Fire-Making Spell]], the [[Incendio Duo Spell]], the [[Lumos Solem Spell]], and even the [[Severing Charm]]. She was also able to conjure a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], which was an incredibly advanced and powerful piece of protective [[magic]] and concrete evidence of her possessing superior magical ability. She was also proficient with the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]], [[Freezing Spell]] and [[Disarming Charm]]. Sprout was also accomplished with the [[Weather-Modifying Charms|atmospheric charm]] ''[[Metelojinx]]'', which she once used to create a [[Water|rainstorm]] in the [[Herbology Classroom]] so an [[Augurey at the Magical Creatures Reserve|Augurey]] could take flight.
*'''[[Potion]]s''': As the Professor of Herbology, Sprout was also very skilled in potion-making, as she was highly familiar and accustomed to the various ingredients required for certain potions. She also experimented with new ways of making potions, including [[Dragon dung Fertiliser]].

She helped her co-workers, [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]] and [[Filius Flitwick|Flitwick]], to chase [[Severus Snape|Snape]] out of Hogwarts. Later on, during the final battle, she took a troop of students up to the [[Astronomy Tower]], which was noted to be a great place to work spells. She eventually survived the battle, showing her competence in [[martial magic]].
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Sprout was highly capable of fighting the [[Dark Arts|Dark Forces]], as she demonstrated when she bravely and successfully fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Death Eaters]], highly dangerous [[Dark Wizard]]s, emerging herself victorious.

==Relationships==
===Minerva McGonagall===
[[File:Mcgonagall.jpg|248x248px|thumb|left|[[Minerva McGonagall]], her long-time friend]]
{{Dialogue a-b-c|Filius Flitwick|I suppose you are aware that nothing we do can indefinitely prevent You-Know-Who to enter the school, right? —|Sprout|But we can delay it.|Minerva McGonagall|Thank you, Pomona.|[[Filius Flitwick]], Pomona Sprout and Minerva McGonagall just before the Battle of Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
The relationship between [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and Professor Sprout dates back to when both attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. The two students maintained an excellent relationship, which was kept well into their adulthood.
When [[Dolores Umbridge]] stood to speak during the [[1995]] [[Welcoming Feast]] after her introduction by [[Albus Dumbledore|Headmaster Dumbledore]], the two professors were both taken aback at this, and even exchange glances of disapproval. Furthermore, during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on [[2 May]], [[1998]], Pomona was shown to have similar traits and the same views on protecting the Castle against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]].

===Neville Longbottom===
[[File:Neville Longbottom.jpg|220x220px|thumb|[[Neville Longbottom]], Sprout's prize student]]
{{Quote|Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I'm really good at Herbology.|[[Neville Longbottom]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Pomona was always friendly with Neville Longbottom; she was quite impressed with his skill in [[Herbology]]. According to [[Alastor Moody]] ([[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Bartemius Crouch Jnr]] in disguise), Sprout told him that Neville had a natural skill for Herbology.

In return, Neville always respected Sprout as one of his favourite teachers. In [[1995]], Neville became excited in the prospect of showing her his [[Mimbulus mimbletonia]]. Neville helped Sprout to use [[Devil's Snare]], [[Mandrake]]s, [[Venomous Tentacula]], and [[Snargaluff]] pods to attack the [[Death Eaters]] in the last battle. Neville eventually succeeded Professor Sprout as the Herbology teacher or taught alongside her.

===Cedric Diggory===
[[File:Cedric Diggory Profile.png|220x220px|thumb|left|[[Cedric Diggory]], one of her students]]
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Professor, where are Mr and Mrs Diggory?|Albus Dumbledore|They are with Professor Sprout. She was Head of Cedric's house, and knew him best.|[[Harry Potter]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]] after Cedric's murder|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Because [[Cedric Diggory]] was a [[Hufflepuff]] student, Professor Sprout knew him well. When [[Harry Potter]] became the second [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] champion in [[1994]], he felt that she had became distant with him as she was supporting Cedric. After [[Cedric Diggory]] was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on Lord Voldemort's orders, she spoke to his parents, as she knew him best. It can also be assumed that during his memorial feast she felt a sense of tragedy in regards to his loss.

===Harry Potter===
[[File:Harry Potter movies hbp promostills 6.jpg|220x220px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], one of her students]]
{{Quote|Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him — but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.|Professor Sprout being distant towards Harry after he became a Triwizard Champion|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Pomona was usually kind to Harry Potter (as well as to his friends, [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]).

During the [[Triwizard Tournament]], however, Sprout became somewhat distant towards Harry as she thought he was stealing [[Cedric Diggory]]'s protagonism as Hogwarts Champion. After Diggory's death, Sprout became friendlier to Harry once again.

Professor Sprout rewarded twenty [[house points]] to [[Harry Potter]] for his bravery in speaking out shortly after the publication of his interview on ''[[The Quibbler]]'' about the [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], saying that she was giving them to him for passing her a watering can (defying the [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|position]] of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and [[Dolores Umbridge]], then-[[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]). In May, [[1998]], Sprout helped defend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to give time for [[Harry Potter|Harry]] to find [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]'s [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|Diadem]].

===Hogwarts staff===

[[File:Hogwarts staff HM.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Professor Sprout with her colleages at Hogwarts]]
Professor Sprout enjoyed a very good and professional relationship with the most of Hogwarts staff. Despite her respective strong friendship with [[Minerva McGonagall]], Sprout also very much respected [[Albus Dumbledore]]. After the Headmaster's death, Sprout was distraught.

She was always friendly with [[Filius Flitwick]], the Head of [[Ravenclaw]] house and [[Charm]]s professor. Both Sprout and Flitwick supported [[Albus Dumbledore]] and the [[Order of the Phoenix]], although they were not official members. After the death of Dumbledore, Flitwick and Sprout (along with others) sat and discussed about it and about [[Severus Snape]]'s disloyalty. The next year, they both tried to protect the students from [[Amycus Carrow|Amycus]] and [[Alecto Carrow]] and fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and survived.

Sprout also appeared to be friendly with [[Horace Slughorn]], the [[Potions Master]]. In 1997, Sprout helped Slughorn pick some herbs for [[potion]]s. She left towards her Greenhouses after she had collected enough for Slughorn's third year class, with some to spare. Slughorn also proceeded to steal some Venomous Tentacula leaves while Sprout was not around. However, he fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] with Sprout.

Other Hogwarts staff that she had a good relationship with were: [[Poppy Pomfrey]], the [[Matron]], [[Argus Filch]], the caretaker, [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor.

==Etymology==
In Roman mythology, ''Pomona'' was the goddess of fruit trees, gardens and orchards. ''Sprout'' is a verb meaning "''to begin to grow, shoot forth, as a plant from a seed''".

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Pomona.PNG|thumb|right|[[Miriam Margolyes]] as Pomona Sprout on the set of {{DH|F2}}]]
[[File:PomonaSprout WB F1 PomonaSproutCharacterIllustration Illust 080615 Port.jpg|thumb|Pomona Sprout as she appears on {{PM}}]]

[[File:Professor Sprout LEGO 2020.jpeg|150px|thumb|Pomona Sprout as a LEGO minifigure (2020 edition)]]
*Sprout is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actress [[Miriam Margolyes]] in {{COS|FA}} and {{DH|F2}}.
*Sprout is voiced in {{HM}}, but not by Margolyes, making Sprout the only [[Head of House]] that is completely not voiced by their actor from the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]].
*The first physical appearance of Professor Sprout in media was in the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|PC/PS1 video game]] of {{PS}}. This was long before any actress had been cast as Sprout, so her appearance was completely different from the later films and games. In the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (PC, Mac)|PC version]], Sprout appeared as a short, not-really-overweight witch with straight black hair pulled back in a bun, a cheery face and emerald green robes. In the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (PlayStation)|PS1 version]], she was featured as a short witch (just a bit taller than the eleven-year old Harry Potter) wearing her red hair in a long plait down her back. Regardless of how she looked, she was voiced by [[Eve Karpf]], who also voiced McGonagall, Hooch and the [[Fat Lady]] in the same game.
*During most of the first six books, Sprout was the only Head of House whose name was not an {{W|alliteration}}. This was changed when Horace Slughorn replaced Severus Snape as Head of Slytherin House in {{HBP}}. Up until the release of {{DH|F1}}, she was also the only Head of House (with the exception of Slughorn, who was first introduced in the sixth instalment) who had not appeared in all the films.
*In the books, Professor Sprout is described as having grey, flyaway hair, while in the films, she is depicted as having short, curly hair.
*In {{DH|F2}}, [[Devil's Snare]] plants are seen attacking [[giant]]s at the beginning of the battle. This is most likely part of Professor Sprout's protection of the school.
**Also in the film, when [[Filius Flitwick]], [[Horace Slughorn]] and [[Molly Weasley]] are placing [[protective enchantment]]s around [[Hogwarts Castle]], a chain of spells can be seen coming from the Herbology greenhouses. This could be Professor Sprout casting the spell ''[[Protego Maxima]]'' to help protect the school quickly as [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] and his Death Eaters are coming to the castle.
*In early German, Italian and Portuguese translations of the first book, Professor Sprout was accidentally referred to as a male, even though chapter 8 refers to her as a "''dumpy little witch''".
*As Professor Sprout's name is related to plants, it is possible that a [[Naming Seer]] was consulted when she was born.
