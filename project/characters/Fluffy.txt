{{Quote|They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.|[[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] encountering Fluffy|Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone}}
'''Fluffy''' was a gigantic, monstrous male [[three-headed dog]] who was once cared for by [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. Fluffy's greatest weakness was the inability to resist falling asleep to the sound of music.<ref name="PS16"/>

==Biography==
===Guarding the Philosopher's Stone===
{{Dialogue a-b-c-b|Ron Weasley|What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school? If any [[dog]] needs exercise, that one does.|Hermione Granger|You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?|Harry Potter|The floor? I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.|No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something.|The [[trio]] after having encountered Fluffy after night hours|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[Rubeus Hagrid]] originally purchased Fluffy from a "[[Greek man|Greek chappie]]" at [[Leaky Cauldron|The Leaky Cauldron]]. Hagrid loaned Fluffy to the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, to aid in guarding the [[Philosopher's Stone]], during the [[1991–1992 school year]].<ref name="PS11">{{PS|B|11}}</ref> In addition, as further insurance against intruders, the door leading to the room Fluffy was in was locked [[magic]]ally.<ref name="PS9">{{PS|B|9}}</ref>

[[File:Fluffy2.png|250px|thumb|left|Fluffy sleeping before the trio enter his room]]
[[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], along with [[Neville Longbottom]], first encountered Fluffy when [[Draco Malfoy]] challenged Harry to a [[Duelling|duel]], which he accepted. When Hermione tried to stop Harry and Ron from sneaking out later that night, she found herself locked out of the [[Gryffindor Tower]], as the [[Fat Lady]] had left sometime earlier, and ended up going along with them. Neville Longbottom, who had forgotten the password to the common room and was sleeping on the floor outside, joined them as well. When they arrived at the [[Trophy Room]], the intended site of the duel, Malfoy was nowhere to be found. To avoid being caught by [[Argus Filch]], they ran away and ended up in the forbidden area on the third floor, staring at the massive three-headed dog. Despite being furious about having broken countless school rules, Hermione had noticed that the dog was standing on a trap door, and guarding something.<ref name="PS9">{{PS|B|9}}</ref> They later deduced, from hints about [[Nicolas Flamel]] dropped unintentionally by Hagrid, that this "something" was the [[Philosopher's Stone]].<ref name="PS11"/><ref name="PS14"/><ref name="PS16"/>

[[File:Fluffy HP1.png|250px|thumb|Fluffy angry-looking after the trio disturbed him]]
Later that year, Hagrid happily told the trio that he had a won a [[Norberta|dragon egg]] in a card game at the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]]. Thinking that it was too much of a coincidence that, as Hagrid had always dreamed of owning a [[dragon]], someone just happened to show up at the local pub with a dragon egg, the trio questioned Hagrid about the supposed [[dragon dealer]]. Upon finding out that Hagrid had never even seen the man's face, as he wore a hood, yet Hagrid had drunkenly told him how to get past Fluffy, they came to the conclusion that the hooded man must have been [[Severus Snape]], when it was really [[Quirinus Quirrell]]. Before Hagrid told Quirrell, though he didn't know it was Quirrell, Hagrid and Dumbledore were the only ones who knew how to get past Fluffy.<ref name="PS14">{{PS|B|14}}</ref>

As that meant the stone was no longer safe, they decided to go after Snape themselves, and Harry brought along the [[flute]] that Hagrid had given him for [[Christmas]] to use in lulling Fluffy to sleep. Arriving at the room, they noticed an enchanted [[harp]] at a sleeping Fluffy's feet, and believed that Professor Snape was already on his way to retrieving the stone. Fluffy soon awoke, as the enchantment on the harp wore off, and it stopped playing. As Harry played the flute, which almost immediately put Fluffy back to sleep, Ron crept over to the trap door and opened it, but was unable to see anything below. Hermione took over playing the flute, while Harry jumped in first, followed by Ron. After they called up to Hermione that it was safe, she stopped playing and jumped down the trap door just in time, as Fluffy woke up as soon as the music stopped.<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

===Return to Greece===
After Fluffy's duties were done, and the Stone was destroyed, Hagrid set Fluffy free in the [[Forbidden Forest]].<ref name="bluepeter">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0301-bluepeter.htm 12 March 2001 Blue Peter interview with J. K. interview]</ref> Shortly thereafter, however, Dumbledore decided to arrange for it to be sent back to his native [[Greece]], as he preferred to keep some of Hagrid's more ill-advised acquisitions away from the school.<ref name="jkr-twitter-fluffy">[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/563634348524843008 @HarmonicalHero .@EmyBemy2 He was repatriated to Greece. Dumbledore liked to put Hagrid's more foolish acquisitions back where they belong - not the forest.] by [https://twitter.com/jk_rowling J.K. Rowling on Twitter]</ref>

In [[2019]], Fluffy was suspected to have been involved in an incident with a taco truck.<ref name="WU">[https://twitter.com/HPWizardsUnite/status/1131575515683409920/ Wizard's Unite]</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Fluffy was generally vicious, fierce, and extremely strong, though he possibly acted somewhat more docile around certain people, like [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who was able to get Fluffy into the third floor corridor. One known way to calm Fluffy was to play music, which made him fall asleep.<ref name="PS16"/> [[Three-headed dog]]s were very rare creatures, and it is unknown if, like the [[Runespoor]], each head served a different purpose.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Fluffy LEGO.jpg|thumb|Fluffy in LEGO form]]
[[File:Fluffy - PAS.png|150px|thumb|Fluffy as seen in {{PAS}}]]

*Three-headed dogs are prominent in [[wikipedia:Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[wikipedia:Roman mythology|Roman mythology]] and are also known as {{Wplink|hellhound}}s, the chief of all being {{Wplink|Cerberus}}, Guardian to the Underworld. However, in {{PS|FA}}, Hagrid says he bought Fluffy from "an [[Unidentified Irishman|Irish feller]]" rather than "a [[Greece|Greek]] chappie"; losing the original reference.
**Screenwriter [[Steve Kloves]] has stated that he originally used "a Greek chappie," but did not know how the line got changed.<sup><ref>[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/ps/rg-ps11.html Reader's Guide to Chapter 11 of ''Philosopher's Stone''] on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref></sup>
*In the film adaptation, Neville was not present when the [[trio]] first met Fluffy.
*In the book, Quirrell and the trio use different musical instruments to put Fluffy to sleep, a harp and a flute. In the film adaptation, the harp is still playing when they enter the room and only stops just before they jump down into the trap door just in the nick of time. In {{LEGO|Y1}}, the harp is broken when they first enter the room and they have to distract Fluffy with a [[rubber duck]] so that they can fix the harp.
*The [[Noble Collection]] sells a pewter metal version of Fluffy.
*In {{WWHP}}, one can purchase a plush version of Fluffy. Additionally, a massive animatronic of Fluffy eating a bone in a cave in the Forbidden Forest can be found in the [[Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure]] attraction.
*The film version of Fluffy appears to be physically based on a Staffordshire Bull Terrier.
*To make Fluffy appear more realistic, his heads were made to move independently and to each have their own personality. One was "smart", one was "alert", and one was "sleepy".<ref name="HPFW">{{HPFW}}</ref>
