'''Quigley''' was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who played as the [[Beater]] for the [[Irish National Quidditch team]] during the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]].


He played in the final against [[Bulgarian National Quidditch team|Bulgaria]] in which he struck a [[Bludger]] towards Bulgaria's [[Viktor Krum]], breaking the [[Seeker]]'s nose. His side won and he and Troy lifted the Quidditch World Cup aloft in the stadium's [[Top Box]].


*It is possible that this Beater is [[Finbar Quigley]], who plays for the Ballycastle Bats, as they share the same last name and Ballycastle could refer to either the small town in [[Northern Ireland]] or the village in the Republic of [[Ireland]]. If so, it is likely that he plays Beater for the [[Ballycastle Bats]].
