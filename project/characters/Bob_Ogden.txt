'''Bob Ogden''' (fl. [[1925]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who worked in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], a department of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], and led the [[Magical Law Enforcement Patrol|Magical Law Enforcement Squad]] in the [[1920s]]. As part of his duties, he once visited the [[Gaunt Shack]], as the Department believed that [[Morfin Gaunt]] had not only performed [[magic]] in front of a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] but also accosted that Muggle, [[Tom Riddle Senior|Tom Riddle Snr]], and performed a [[Hive-conjuring spell|dark charm]] on him. After encountering little cooperation from the inhabitants of the Gaunt Shack, Ogden [[Apparition|Apparated]] to the Ministry then returned with reinforcements, with whom he overpowered the Gaunts and subsequently turned them over to the [[Wizengamot]] to await judgement. His life after this incident is unknown, but he died sometime before [[7 September]] [[1996]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ogden was born either under a pure wizarding family or under a half-Muggle, half-wizarding family. He also seemed to have trouble disguising as a Muggle like most wizards, thereby ruling out the possibility that he was a Muggle-born. He presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and after Hogwarts was employed by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

===Professional life===
Ogden was employed by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and worked at the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. He eventually rose to become head of the [[Magical Law Enforcement Patrol|Magical Law Enforcement Squad]].

===Visit to the Gaunt shack===
{{Quote|Mr Gaunt, I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our information — is that Morfin performed a [[jinx]] or [[hex]] on the [[Tom Riddle Senior|said Muggle]], [[Hive-conjuring spell|causing him to erupt in highly painful hives]].|Bob Ogden presenting his information to [[Marvolo Gaunt]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Bob Ogden Gaunt Shack.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Ogden approaching the [[Gaunt Shack]]]]
Around the [[1925|1920s]], Ogden, "disguised" in a strange assortment of [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] clothes (due to his inexperience with trying to look like Muggles) which included a frock-coat and spats over a striped men's one-piece suit, went to the [[Gaunt Shack]], to interview one of its occupants. The Department had reason to believe that not only did [[Morfin Gaunt]] perform [[magic]] in front of a Muggle the previous night, but he accosted that same Muggle and performed a [[dark charm]] on him ([[Tom Riddle Senior|Tom Riddle Snr]]) and caused him to [[Hive-conjuring spell|erupt in highly painful hives]].

Upon arrival, Ogden was shocked when he found himself held at [[Morfin Gaunt's knife|knife]] and [[Morfin Gaunt's wand|wand]]-point by Morfin and was unable to understand his use of [[Parseltongue]], in which Morfin commanded Ogden to scram. Morfin then fired a [[Pus-squirting spell|dark charm]] at him, that caused [[pus]] to erupt from his nose. Ogden, stunned by this, was thrust backwards and collided with two Muggles, one being the same Muggle who had been the victim of the crime in question and the other his [[Cecilia|lady friend]]. After regaining his senses, Ogden apologised to the Muggles and continued his mission to serve a warrant to Morfin. Morfin's father, [[Marvolo Gaunt]], who instead used English, called Morfin off and confronted Ogden. Ogden was polite and courteous and was reluctantly allowed to enter to discuss Morfin's serious breach of wizarding law which occurred in the early hours of that morning.

Upon entry into the dilapidated and filthy shack, Ogden politely greeted the third and final occupant, [[Merope Riddle|Merope Gaunt]], and then engaged in conversation with Marvolo, informing him of Morfin's crimes. Ogden had said that the Ministry sent an Owl earlier in the day, but Marvolo snidely remarked he had no use for Owls, as in his view, reading was for wimps, to which Ogden replied that the Gaunt men had no excuse for ignoring a police order. Ogden witnessed the deplorable treatment of Merope by her family and Marvolo's stubbornness and belief in pure-blood superiority, ignoring Ogden's claim that Morfin had broken wizarding law and proclaiming Muggles "had it coming to them." Ogden then pulled out a small scroll of parchment, which he revealed was a summons to a Ministry hearing, though this made matters far worse, as Marvolo went into a tirade about how their "superior" family should not be summoned by anyone. Ogden justified that it was his right as Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad that allowed him to summon suspects of magical crime and largely ignored Marvolo's ranting. Afterward, Ogden said that Morfin made an unjustified attack on the defenceless Muggle, which warranted investigation and punishment.

Seeing that their discussion was getting them nowhere, Ogden rose to leave, informing Marvolo of the time and date of the hearing and Morfin's expectancy to attend it, when suddenly the three people began using Parseltongue again, leaving Ogden bewildered and irritated by the sudden outbreak of incomprehensible language usage. Marvolo suddenly lunged to choke Merope, and Ogden, concerned for her safety, promptly performed a [[Revulsion Jinx]], making Marvolo fall away, but causing Morfin to begin firing [[hex]]es indiscriminately at him. Ogden fled for his life. As he left, Ogden was hit by the Muggle victim, Tom Riddle Snr's horse carriage, and, after a brief moment of disorientation, Ogden set off again, [[Apparition|Apparating]] back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Ogden and his men overpowered the Gaunts when they attempted to fight, removed them from the cottage, and turned them over to the [[Wizengamot]], where they passed judgement.

===Death===
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Who was Bob Ogden?|Albus Dumbledore|He was employed by the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. He died some time ago but not before I tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties.|Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore before entering Ogden's memory|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Ogden died some time before [[7 September]], [[1996]], of natural causes, but not before [[Albus Dumbledore]], during his investigations into [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s mysterious past, tracked him down and persuaded Ogden to confide his recollections of his encounter with the Gaunt family to him. These memories were placed in his [[Pensieve]] and later shown to [[Harry Potter]]. Ogden remained unaware that his actions set the stage for the creation and rise of Voldemort himself. Although Bob Ogden had helped set the events into motion, he did so in the performance of his police duties, and would have never done so had Morfin Gaunt kept the wizard law. Ultimately, had it not been for Morfin's attack on Tom Riddle, there would have been no Voldemort.

==Physical appearance==
Bob Ogden was described as being a "short, plump man wearing enormously thick [[glasses]] that reduced his eyes to [[mole]]like specks". Like most wizards, he was inexperienced when trying to look like a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]; his choice of clothing was a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Despite his appearance, Ogden was an extremely competent wizard and a straight-to-the-point man, who tolerated a great deal from others, and felt no need to justify his [[Blood status]] to anyone, prompting Harry Potter to reflect that his respect for the man when he saw him in a memory was greatly improved by his dismissal of blood status as being important to any kind of discussion.

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Bob Ogden|I'm head of the [[Magical Law Enforcement Patrol|Magical Law Enforcement Squad]].|Marvolo Gaunt|And you think we're scum, do you? Scum who'll come running when the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] tells 'em to? Do you know who you're talking to, you filthy little [[Mudblood]], do you?|I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr Gaunt.|Bob Ogden standing his ground against [[Marvolo Gaunt]], who calls him a "[[Mudblood]]" despite not knowing Ogden's [[blood status]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}} 
A diligent [[officer]] of the law, Bob Ogden took his duties seriously and maintained a professional and courteous demeanour despite Marvolo's hostility toward him and the Ministry. He was utterly unintimidated by [[Marvolo Gaunt]]'s aggressive behaviour, and notably also appalled by the way Gaunt treated his daughter Merope, and displayed both bravery in compassion when he defended her from her father's assault, who tried to strangle her to death when he learned that she was in love with a Muggle.

He also earned the posthumous respect of Harry Potter, as he was a dedicated policeman who confronted two dangerous men unflappably, and did not seem to think blood purity was relevant to the topic of enforcing wizarding law.

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|...Ogden had lifted [[Bob Ogden's wand|his own]] and said firmly, “Reparo.” The pot mended itself instantly.|Bob Ogden performing the [[Mending Charm]] successfully|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
*'''[[Magic]]al aptitude''': Ogden successfully used the [[Revulsion Jinx]] to prevent Marvolo from attacking his daughter. He also quickly repaired a pot with the [[Mending Charm]] that was accidentally smashed by Merope, as well as using a [[Counter-curse]] when Morfin used a [[Pus-squirting spell|dark charm]] on him.
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Bob Ogden used [[Apparition]] successfully to get back to the Ministry of Magic and returned with reinforcements to help him subdue Marvolo and Morfin Gaunt.

==Behind the scenes==
*Bob Ogden and his memory scene with the Gaunts were completely omitted from the {{HBP|FA}}.
*It is possible that Ogden is related to former-Wizengamot member [[Tiberius Ogden]], though it remains unconfirmed.
*It is also quite possible he was the inventor - or a relative thereof - of "Ogden's Old Firewhiskey", though this is merely speculation.
*Ironically enough, his actions were what set in motion what would lead to the very existence of Lord Voldemort himself – if Ogden had not returned with reinforcements, Merope would have never been freed and had the opportunity to seduce Tom Riddle Snr; had none of this happened, Lord Voldemort would have never been conceived. However, Ogden was a law enforcement agent who reacted to a violation of wizard law committed by Morfin Gaunt, and as such Morfin was the mastermind behind the chain reaction.
*Marvolo Gaunt referred to Ogden as a '[[Mudblood]]', an insult usually reserved for a wizard or witch of entirely [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] birth. His complete unfamiliarity with proper Muggle dress, however, suggests that he was at the very least half-blood. Gaunt may simply be using the term as a general insult, due to his prejudices. [[J. K. Rowling]] later confirmed that the term can also be used for half-bloods.
