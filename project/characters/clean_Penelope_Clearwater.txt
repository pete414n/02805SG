'''Penelope 'Penny' Clearwater''' (born c. [[1975]] or [[1976]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1987]] to [[1994]]. In her later school years, she was a [[Prefect]], and eventually started dating [[Percy Weasley]], a [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor student]] and a fellow [[Prefect]]. 

After she finished her education at Hogwarts, Penelope and Percy never married. It can be assumed that they broke up at some point. Percy married another woman named [[Audrey Weasley]] instead.




Penelope was born in c.[[1975]] or [[1976]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]]. She was either from a [[Non-magic people|muggle]] family or had both muggle and magical heritage.



Early years
Penelope Clearwater arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1987]] and upon her arrival was [[Sorting Hat|Sorted]] into the [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] of [[Ravenclaw]].

Sixth year

In the summer of [[1992]], [[Percy Weasley]] wrote many letters to her and met up with her in secret throughout the next school year. On [[25 December]] [[1992]], Penelope


In the same year, the [[Chamber of Secrets]] had been opened, unleashing a 'monster' that was hunting down [[Muggle-born]] students. [[Hermione Granger]] deduced that it was a [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]], and as she rushed to inform her friends, she met Penelope as the first person she bumped into, and told her to use her [[Penelope Clearwater's mirror|mirror]] to look around corners to spot the [[Snake|serpent]]. 

Penelope and Hermione made good use of Penelope's [[Penelope Clearwater's mirror|mirror]] to navigate the school hallways, but they looked the [[Basilisk]] in the eye through the reflection of the mirror, [[petrification|petrifying]] them both. Penelope was eventually revived with a [[Mandrake Restorative Draught|draught]] prepared from [[Mandrake]] roots, along with Hermione and the other victims.

Before the end of the school year, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] walked in on Penelope kissing Percy in an empty classroom. He told her to keep it secret, but she later told on them.

Seventh year
By the summer of [[1993]], Penelope was still dating Percy who had a picture of her at home. When someone spilt [[tea]] on it, Percy was upset and blamed Ron, who said Penelope hid her face because she had a blotchy nose.

In September 1993, while on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]], Penelope was approached by an excited Percy, wanting to show her the shiny new badge he had for being made Head Boy.

Penelope appeared to be a serious [[Quidditch]] fan, having appreciated [[Harry Potter]]'s new [[broomstick]], a [[Firebolt]], greatly, and betting ten galleons on the outcome of the [[Ravenclaw]] vs [[Gryffindor]] match with Percy. When she wanted to hold the broomstick, Percy heartily told her not to sabotage them by doing so.

When Ravenclaw later lost, Percy congratulated Harry and then went to find Penelope to receive the ten galleons she owed him.

Sadly, she did not end up marrying her Hogwarts boyfriend, as Percy eventually married a woman named [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey]] and had two children with her.


Penelope was described as having long, curly hair.



*'''[[Wand]]''': Penelope owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[Wand core|core]]. She presumably purchased it from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]], before starting her [[first year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1987]].
*'''[[Penelope Clearwater's mirror|Mirror]]''': Penelope owned an ornate hand mirror, which was useful for looking around corners. When she encountered the [[Serpent of Slytherin]] in [[1993]], the [[Basilisk]]'s deadly gaze was reflected by the mirror's glass and only resulted in her and [[Hermione Granger]] being [[Petrification|petrified]], saving both their lives.
*'''[[Prefect badge]]''': Having been a [[Ravenclaw]] [[Prefect]] whilst at Hogwarts, Penelope owned a Ravenclaw Prefect badge, which she would have worn during her official Prefect duties.



, her ex-boyfriend]]
In the summer of [[1992]], Percy and Penelope wrote many letters to each other. She began dating Percy Weasley in her [[1992–1993 school year|fifth year]], but they kept it secret. They would meet in deserted classrooms to kiss, but were caught once by Percy's sister, Ginny.

Percy was distraught when Penelope was [[petrification|petrified]] in [[1993]], and immensely relieved when she was cured by the [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]]. The secret came out when Ginny revealed the truth to her brothers, asking them not to tease Percy over the fact, which they did anyway.

With the secret out, Percy and Penelope appeared in public together, and he kept a photo of her. During his stay at the [[Leaky Cauldron]] before the start of his seventh year, he accused Ron of dripping tea on it.

Percy was excited to see her on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9¾]], wanting to show her the Head Boy badge he was given and, later in the year, wagered ten [[Galleon]]s on the outcome of the [[Gryffindor]] vs [[Ravenclaw]] match, despite not actually having ten galleons. He playfully remarked to her about sabotaging Harry's [[Firebolt]] when she asked if she could touch it. He was unafraid of asking Penelope for the ten galleons she later owed him, while she would be the only who cared to listen to him while he ranted at a later date.

For unknown reasons, Percy and Penelope did not stay together, and Percy ended up marrying [[Audrey Weasley]].


*In ''The Odyssey'', [[Wikipedia:Penelope|Penelope]] was the wife of Odysseus. While he was away fighting the Trojan Wars, she was pursued by many suitors; to hold them off, Penelope told them she would choose one when she finished weaving a shroud, but unravelled her work every night to prevent this from occurring. The poetic sense of the name is a faithful, clever, woman, particularly a wife. It is derived from the Greek words ''pene'', 'web', and ''ōps'', meaning 'eye' or 'face', although it is questionable; the name can also mean 'weaver' or 'duck'.
*The name is also possibly derived from the Greek name 'penelops' for a kind of [[duck]] that was said to have rescued and nurtured Penelope when she was exposed to die as an infant.
*Clearwater is a descriptive place name that suggests her ancestors lived near a body of [[water]] (which could be why her name may mean 'duck').




*In , Penelope is not a victim of the Basilisk, and only appears when she and [[Percy Weasley]] are walking from the [[Great Hall]] during the first day of term, and are met and greeted by [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]], and later, in the crowd during the [[Duelling Club]]. She is also present at the [[End-of-Term Feast]]. She is played by [[Gemma Padley]].
*Early printings of ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' make Penelope a [[fifth year]] student, making her a year below Percy. Later printings revise this to make her a [[sixth year]].
*Despite Penelope graduated from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1994]], she is depicted as a Hogwarts student in , which is set from [[1995]] onwards. This was probably done simply for aesthetic reasons.
