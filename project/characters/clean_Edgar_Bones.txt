During the [[First Wizarding War]], Edgar Bones became member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation led and founded by [[Albus Dumbledore]], in order to oppose the [[Tom Riddle|Dark Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].

*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': Considered to be an exceptionally talented wizard by both [[Alastor Moody]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]], it is highly likely that Edgar was one of the most powerful wizards in the [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]].


The name "Edgar" is derived from the Old English elements ''ead'' "rich, blessed" and ''gar'' "spear". This was the name of a 10th-century English king who is regarded as a saint. The name did not survive long after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 18th century, in part due to a character by this name in Sir Walter Scott's novel 'The Bride of Lammermoor' (1819).
