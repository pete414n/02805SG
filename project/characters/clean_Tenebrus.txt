'''Tenebrus''' was a [[Thestral]] who lived in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. Part of the [[Hogwarts Thestral herd|Hogwarts Thestral Herd]], he was the first Thestral to have been born in the Forest, presumably to the male and one of the five females initially acquired.


He was the personal favourite of [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|gamekeeper]] [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. In [[1995]], when Hagrid introduced his [[Fifth year]] [[Care of Magical Creatures]] students to Thestrals, Tenebrus was the first to appear after he called for the herd.


The name Tenebrus is presumably derived from the English adjective ''tenebrous'', which means "dark", "gloomy", or "obscure". This word is itself derived from the Latin ''tenebrae'', meaning "darkness".
