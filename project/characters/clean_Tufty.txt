'''Tufty''' was one of [[Arabella Figg|Mrs Figg]]'s part-[[Kneazle]] cats. The other three were [[Mr Tibbles]], [[Snowy]] and [[Mr Paws]]. [[Harry Potter]] saw it (or possibly its picture) when he went to stay with Mrs Figg when [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] got to go to places on his birthday. Harry found a hard time being remorseful when Mrs Figg broke her leg after reminding himself that it would be a while before he had to see Mr Tibbles, Snowy, Tufty and Mr Paws again.
