{{Quote|Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard [[Albert Runcorn|you]] are. And if he survives Azkaban, you'll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons, and his friends —|[[Arthur Weasley]]'s high opinion of Dirk|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
'''Dirk Cresswell''' (c. [[1961]] – [[March]], [[1998]]) was a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. In the mid-[[1990s]] he became Head of the [[Goblin Liaison Office]], in the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

Dirk attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1970s]], becoming a favourite student of [[Potions Master]] [[Horace Slughorn]]. One of Dirk's most notable traits was his fluency in [[Gobbledegook]]. After graduating, he went to work at the Ministry and eventually became Head of the Goblin Liaison Office. Many of his colleagues considered him a great wizard. 

When the Ministry was taken over by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], Dirk attempted to use a forged family tree in order to claim wizarding heritage, but was discovered by [[Albert Runcorn]]. He went on the run to avoid the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]], but was eventually caught and murdered by [[Snatchers]].

==Biography==
===Early life {{c|1960s-1979}}===
{{Quote|And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], too — now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course — another Muggle-born, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings-on at Gringotts!|[[Horace Slughorn]] telling Harry Potter about Cresswell's student years|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Dirk Cresswell was born sometime between September, 1960 and September, 1961, presumably somewhere in the British Isles, into the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Cresswell family]]. Having displayed [[magic]]al ability, he was eventually offered a place at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he undertook his magical education from on around [[1972]] to likely [[1978]].<ref name="birthyear" /> According to [[Professor]] [[Horace Slughorn]], the [[Potions Master]] of the day, Cresswell was an exceptional student, and he was invited to join the [[Slug Club]].<ref name="HBP4" />
<!--- Dirk is not mentioned or depicted in HM and is not known to have been impacted by the Cursed Vaults; please explain otherwise in talk page if you think otherwise, thank you.--->

===Career at the Ministry of Magic {{c|1979-1997}}===
Sometime after graduating from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1979, Cresswell joined the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. He eventually rose to the post of Head of the [[Goblin Liaison Office]], succeeding [[Cuthbert Mockridge]]<ref name="GF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref> in either 1994, 1995, or 1996.

He remained in contact with [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] and passed on news about internal affairs at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] to him, something of which Slughorn was glad of. [[Albus Dumbledore]] also suggested that Slughorn's friendliness with Cresswell resulted in Cresswell requesting him to make suggestions for possible junior members within the Goblin Liaison Office.<ref name="HBP4" />

====Muggle-Born Registration Commission====
{{Quote|As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will submit themselves… for evaluation. But know this: you have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide.|[[Pius Thicknesse]] delivers his speech to Ministry employees|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1}}

During the height of the Second Wizarding War, on 1 August, 1997, the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was taken over by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Shortly after, it began persecuting [[Muggle-born]] wizards and witches, beginning with the formation of the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] and the Snatchers organisations, in accordance with the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] ideology. Muggle-borns were accused of having stolen [[magic]] and sentenced to [[Azkaban]] for it.<ref name="DH11">{{DH|B|11}}</ref><ref name="DH13" />

[[File:SnatchersMinistry.jpg|240x240px|thumb|left|[[Snatchers]] drag a battered Dirk Cresswell across the Ministry Atrium]]

Cresswell arranged with a wizard to forge a false family tree so that the Ministry would believe that he was of a different [[blood status]]. However, [[Albert Runcorn]], a powerful Ministry official and supporter of the Death Eater regime, tracked the wizard who faked his family tree and Cresswell was arrested.<ref name="DH12">{{DH|B|12}}</ref><ref name="DH13" /> While Death Eater-controlled and newly instated [[Minister for Magic|Minister]] Pius Thicknesse, alongside [[Dolores Umbridge]], [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]], and Albert Runcorn, delivered a speech to the Ministry employees about the changes in Ministry policy, Snatchers arrived and dragged a battered and bruised Dirk Cresswell across the Atrium.<ref name="DHpt1">{{DH|F1}}</ref>

Auror John Dawlish was charged with transporting Cresswell to Azkaban fortress in the North Sea, via [[broomstick]]. Halfway to the prison, Dirk managed to [[Stunning Spell|stun]] Dawlish, whom he believed to be under the effects of the [[Confundus Charm]], and stole the [[Auror]]'s [[John Dawlish's broomstick|broomstick]], using it to escape.<ref name="DH15">{{DH|B|15}}</ref>

===On the run {{c|1997-1998}}===
{{Dialogue|Dean Thomas|I know Harry Potter. And I reckon he's the real thing — the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.|Dirk|Yeah, there's a lot would like to believe he's that, son, me included. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You'd think if he knew anything we don't, or had anything special going for him, he'd be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the ''Prophet'' made a pretty good case against him —|A conversation while on the run from Snatchers|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}} 

[[File:Dean_griphook_3.jpg|241x241px|thumb|Dirk's fugitive mates, Dean Thomas and Griphook]]

Dirk then went on the run, eventually meeting up with fellow fugitives [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]] and [[Dean Thomas]], as well as goblins [[Griphook]] and [[Gornuk]]. The group proceeded to stay on the move along the countryside.<ref name="DH15" />

One night, in the autumn of 1997, they set camp on a riverbank in [[Wales]], where they could summon some salmon to eat. Unbeknownst to any of them, [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] were sitting in a tent concealed from sight by a number of protective enchantments. The group started talking. Dirk told them of his escape. The subject of conversation turned into war and [[Harry Potter]]. Dirk told the group he had doubts [[Severus Snape]] had really killed [[Albus Dumbledore]], as the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', which he had been reading, made such a strong case against Harry. Tonks told Cresswell to start reading ''[[The Quibbler]]'', an independent publication not under the control of the Ministry, to know the facts. Cresswell exploded into laughter, swallowing a fish bone and expressing scorn at what he called "''that lunatic rag of [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]]'s''". They told Cresswell ''The Quibbler'' was not so lunatic any more, and Dean voiced his trust in Harry.<ref name="DH15" />

The conversation soon enough turned into a discussion of whether they should sleep there or back up a wooded slope whence they came. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire and clambered back up the incline.<ref name="DH15" />

====Death====
{{Quote|But before we hear from [[Kingsley Shacklebolt|Royal]] and [[Remus Lupin|Romulus]] let's take a moment to report those deaths that the ''Wizarding Wireless Network News'' and ''Daily Prophet'' don't think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.|[[Lee Jordan]] announces Cresswell's murder in ''Potterwatch''|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Eventually, the group was caught by a gang of Snatchers and Cresswell, Ted Tonks, and Gornuk were murdered while resisting capture. Griphook and Dean Thomas managed to escape relatively unscathed.<ref name="DH22" />

===Post-mortem===
The death of Dirk Cresswell and his comrades was omitted from the ''Daily Prophet'' and the ''[[Wizarding Wireless Network News]]'', which were under the control of the Death Eater regime and ceased reporting deaths caused by Voldemort's regime. It was, however, announced in a [[March]], [[1998]], broadcast of ''[[Potterwatch]]''.<ref name="DH22" /> Dirk left behind a [[Dirk Cresswell's wife|wife]] and at least [[Cresswell brothers|two sons]].<ref name="DH13" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
Many considered Dirk a great [[Wizardkind|wizard]] (such as [[Arthur Weasley]] and [[Horace Slughorn]]),<ref name="HBP4"/><ref name="DH13" /> which suggests that he was very gifted in [[magic]].
*'''[[Potion]]s''': The [[Potions Master]] [[Horace Slughorn]] considered Dirk to be one of his "all-time favourite students" whilst he was a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], implying he was proficient in [[Potions (class)|Potions]].<ref name="HBP4"/>
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Dirk was a competent [[broomstick]] flyer, as he was successfully able to use [[John Dawlish]]'s [[John Dawlish's broomstick|broomstick]] to escape from capture via flight.<ref name="DH15"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Dirk was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name="LEGOY2"/> an incredibly advanced and impressive piece of [[magic]] and evidence of superior magical skill. He was able to successfully subdue [[John Dawlish]] with the [[Stunning Spell]], allowing him to escape capture.<ref name="DH15"/>
*'''Multilingualism''': Dirk was fluent in [[Gobbledegook]], the language of [[Goblin]]s, a notable talent which allowed him to become head of the [[Goblin Liaison Office]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. He was able to instantly understand [[Griphook]]s use of the language whilst in hiding with him.<ref name="DH15"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Dirk" is the short form of ''Diederik''. The name was popularised in the English-speaking world by actor Dirk Bogarde (1921-1999), who had some Dutch ancestry. This is also the Scots word for a type of dagger.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Dirk_Cresswell.png|thumb|150px|Dirk Cresswell in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]
*Dirk Cresswell is played in {{DH|F1}} by an unknown actor. The part is listed by IMDb as being played (uncredited) by [[Ricky Wilson]], lead singer of the [[wikipedia:Kaiser Chiefs|Kaiser Chiefs]]. The role was never identified in the film, but the character of Dirk Cresswell took on his appearance in {{LEGO|Y2}}. Wilson himself however has said it was in fact not him playing Cresswell. Ricky was offered a part as a singer in a wedding band, but the band was eventually replaced by CGI instruments. Ricky however still asked if he could be in the film, and was an extra (leaning against a wall in a purple suit), for which he had to do five days' shooting.<ref name="Wilson">[https://www.whattowatch.com/features/kaiser-chiefs-star-breaks-silence-on-his-harry-potter-cameo Kaiser Chiefs star breaks silence on his Harry Potter cameo]</ref>
*Like [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]] and [[Gornuk]], Dirk Cresswell's outlaw storyline was cut from {{DH|F1}}, although all three are briefly mentioned on the radio to have been killed.
