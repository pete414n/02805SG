{{Quote|I'm half-blood. My father, my father was a wizard. William Alderton. He worked here for thirty years. Perhaps you know him. Always wore his jacket inside out...|Alderton begging the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] to release him|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1}}
'''Alderton''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] living somewhere in the British Isles during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Despite his claims to be [[half-blood]], Alderton was 'interviewed' by the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] on [[2 September]], [[1997]], and was either sent to [[Azkaban]] or [[Wandless|stripped of his wand and job]].

==History==
===Early life===
According to Alderton, he was the son of [[William Alderton]], a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], making him a [[half-blood]]. The [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], however, determined he was a [[Muggle-born]] wizard.

He most likely attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth.

===Second Wizarding War and Prosecution===
In [[1997]], after the [[Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic|infiltration]] of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]], he was singled out as being Muggle-born by the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] and was tried. He was found guilty during the trial and was therefore led away by two Ministry guards afterwards, either to await imprisonment or to be stripped of his wand and job. As he left the courtroom, he desperately tried to convince the guards that he was a half-blood by claiming that his [[William Alderton|father]] was a [[pure-blood]] wizard, but was unsuccessful. It is unknown what happened to him afterwards.

==Behind the scenes==
*He is played by [[Ned Dennehy]] and is credited as "Scared Man".
