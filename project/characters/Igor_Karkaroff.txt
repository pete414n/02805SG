'''Professor Igor Karkaroff''' (d. [[24 June]] – [[31 July]] [[1996]])<ref name="HBP6" /> was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Headmaster]] of [[Durmstrang Institute]]. During the [[First Wizarding War]], he was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who served [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. After being captured and briefly imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] following his master's defeat, Karkaroff turned in several of his fellow Death Eaters to the [[Wizengamot]] in exchange for his crimes being pardoned. 

Karkaroff later went on to become Durmstrang's headmaster, leading the school's delegation to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] for the [[1994]] [[Triwizard Tournament]]. There, Karkaroff did everything he could to get his school's champion ([[Viktor Krum]]) in the lead, and flew into a panic when his [[Dark Mark]] began to burn. When Voldemort returned, he fled. For his treachery, Karkaroff was hunted down and murdered by his former comrades in the summer of [[1996]]. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Virtually nothing is known about Igor's early life but based on his name he was most likely born somewhere in Eastern Europe, possibly in either [[Russia]] or [[Bulgaria]] and may have attended [[Durmstrang Institute]] in his youth. He did, however, refer [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as 'Dear old Hogwarts', suggesting he at least visited it in the past.<ref name="GOF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref> 

===First Wizarding War===
{{Dialogue a-b|Karkaroff|You must understand that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy…we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone knew exactly who we all were —|Alastor Moody|Which was a wise move, wasn't it, as it prevented someone like you, Karkaroff, from turning all of them in.|Karkaroff turning in his fellow Death Eaters|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
In his younger days, Karkaroff was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and acquaintance of [[Severus Snape]]. It was reported that Karkaroff helped [[Antonin Dolohov]] [[Cruciatus Curse|torture]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s and non-supporters of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]. He was eventually captured by [[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody]] and spent a short period of time in [[Azkaban]].<ref name="GOF30"/> 

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-igor.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Karkaroff giving information about other Death Eaters]]
Shortly after Voldemort's first downfall, Karkaroff appeared before the [[Council of Magical Law]], offering information in exchange for leniency. He claimed to have felt great remorse for his crimes as a Death Eater, however Moody was sceptical. Among the names he gave were [[Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]], [[Evan Rosier]], [[Travers]], [[Mulciber (Marauder-era)|Mulciber]], and [[Severus Snape|Snape]]. He became increasingly desperate as it was revealed that these names were worthless; the Death Eaters he mentioned had already been captured, killed, or, in Snape's case, had switched sides.<ref name="GOF30"/> 

However, Karkaroff was able to satisfy the Council when he submitted the name [[Augustus Rookwood]], an [[Unspeakable]] who was spying on the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] for Voldemort. This information was new to the Ministry, and he was sent back to Azkaban for a review of his case. From [[Sirius Black]]'s comment that Karkaroff 'put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place', it can be assumed that he named other Death Eaters in addition to Rookwood after his initial hearing or that the discovery of Rookwood helped the Ministry weed out other Death Eaters and other Voldemort supporters.<ref name="GOF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref>

===Between the wars===
====Headmaster of Durmstrang====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Barty Crouch Junior (disguised as Moody)|Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object! It would have needed an exceptionally strong [[Confundus Charm]] to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament.... I'm guessing they submitted Potter's name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category....|Karkaroff|You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody, and a very ingenious theory it is — though of course, I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised [[basilisk egg]], and smashed it to pieces before realising it was a carriage clock.

It's my job to think the way [[Dark wizard]]s do, Karkaroff — as you ought to remember....|Karkaroff arguing with Barty Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
At some point after his release from Azkaban, Karkaroff became Headmaster of [[Durmstrang Institute]]. During his time as head of the school, Professor Karkaroff was seen by both students and parents alike as unprincipled and egotistical, leading many parents to withdraw their children from Durmstrang during his administration since he encouraged a environment dominated by fear and intimidation from his students.<ref name="PM">{{WW|durmstrang-institute}}</ref> The school also became notorious for its detailed teaching of the [[Dark Arts]] as an [[Dark Arts (class)|academic class]]; however, it is possible that this reputation existed to some extent even before his headmaster-ship.<ref name="GOF">{{GOF}}</ref>

[[File:ViktorKrumIgorKarkaroff KrumEntersHogwarts.jpg|250px|thumb|Karkaroff entering Hogwarts along with some of his students]]
In the [[1994–1995 school year]], the [[Triwizard Tournament]] was held for the first time in many years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Karkaroff ventured to Hogwarts to supervise his students and to prepare Durmstrang's champion for the Tournament, as well as to serve as one of the five judges. From the moment of his arrival at Hogwarts, it was obvious that Karkaroff was heavily biased towards the champion from his own school, [[Viktor Krum]].<ref name="GOF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref>

During Karkaroff's first evening at Hogwarts, he encountered former [[Auror]] '[[Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]]' (who was actually [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] in disguise), who was Hogwarts' new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor. It was apparent that Karkaroff and 'Moody' not only knew each other, but had an unpleasant history. Karkaroff unsuccessfully tried to avoid 'Moody' after that first evening.<ref name="GOF16">{{GOF|B|16}}</ref> It is likely that Barty Crouch Jnr despised Karkaroff himself because of his betrayal of Lord Voldemort.<ref name="GOF35"/>    

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-screencaps.com-12913.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Karkaroff showing Snape his Dark Mark and voicing his concerns]]
Like [[Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]], the Headmistress of the [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]], Karkaroff was outraged when [[Harry Potter]]'s name was chosen from the [[Goblet of Fire]], giving Hogwarts two champions instead of one. While he had to accept Harry's presence in the competition, he consistently gave Harry lower scores on the tasks and blatantly favoured Krum over the other champions. He also sneaked around to gather information on the tasks in hopes of giving Krum an advantage. 

He also ruthlessly insulted [[Albus Dumbledore]] when [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Crouch]] attacked Krum in the shadows and accused him of foul-play, going as far as spitting on the ground at Dumbledore's feet. However, this nearly earned him significant physical injury at the hands of [[Rubeus Hagrid]]; Hagrid, fervently loyal to Dumbledore, lifted Karkaroff by the throat, smashed him against a tree and yelled at him to apologise for this disgusting display. Dumbledore, however, ordered Hagrid to let him go, to which he complied reluctantly.<ref name="GOF" />

[[File:KarkaroffSnapeYule.jpg|250px|thumb|Karkaroff present at the [[Yule Ball]]]]
About halfway through the school year, Karkaroff's actions became increasingly suspicious. At the [[Yule Ball]], which he attended with [[Aurora Sinistra|Professor Aurora Sinistra]], and again after a [[Potions (class)|Potions]] lesson, he confronted [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] about a secret matter. His agitated and increasingly apprehensive state aroused the suspicions of Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]]. [[Sirius Black]], Harry's godfather, told him to be wary of Karkaroff because he was a former [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]].<ref name="GOF"/>

===Return of the Dark Lord===
{{Dialogue a-b|Severus Snape|Karkaroff's [[Dark Mark|Mark]] is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell. Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns... I am not such a coward.|Albus Dumbledore|No. You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff.|Discussion of Karkaroff's cowardice and fear|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

Karkaroff fled for his life on [[24 June]] [[1995]], the night of the Third Task of the Tournament, and the night of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s restoration to his body and power. Snape admitted that Karkaroff had come to him, concerned about the [[Dark Mark]] on his left forearm, a mark Snape also bore as a former [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. The Mark had been growing darker throughout the school year, signalling Voldemort's growing strength. Karkaroff feared Voldemort's return because he had betrayed too many of the Dark Lord's servants to be allowed back into the fold. [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] doubted he would get far, as the Dark Lord had 'ways of tracking his enemies' and no one who had ever betrayed the Dark Lord ever got far.<ref name="GOF35">{{GOF|B|35}}</ref>

Contrary to Crouch's belief, Karkaroff was able to stay alive for a whole year, fleeing to parts unknown, though a possible contribution is that Voldemort was trying to keep a low profile due to the Ministry's denial at the time. 

====Death====
[[File:DailyProphetKarkaroff.png|245x245px|thumb|left|A 1996 ''[[Daily Prophet]]''<nowiki> article: ''</nowiki>''Former Durmstrang Headmaster Found Dead''<nowiki>'</nowiki>|alt=]]
Inevitably, Karkaroff was finally tracked down to a shack in the north and killed by Death Eaters, the [[Dark Mark]] [[Morsmordre|cast]] into the sky, shortly after Voldemort's revival was finally accepted by the Ministry, which further enforced that his year-long survival was due to the Death Eaters keeping under the radar at the time. 

This information was revealed to the assembled guests of [[Harry Potter]]'s sixteenth birthday party by [[Remus Lupin]], who, among others, were surprised Karkaroff had survived for so long.<ref name="HBP6" />

==Physical appearance==
Karkaroff was described to be tall and thin like [[Albus Dumbledore]], but with an unctuously cheerful demeanour, while his smile 'didn't reach his eyes', which were blue and remained cold and unmoving.<ref name="GOF" /> This made him slightly unnerving. His weak chin was not completely covered by his goatee, which ended with a small curl. His teeth were yellow and he liked to dress in sleek, silver furs. As a former [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], he bore the [[Dark Mark]] on his left inner forearm.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|One, too cowardly to return... he will pay...|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s low opinion of Igor|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Karkaroff was a ruthless and immoral man, having been a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] in his youth and a turncoat when it suited him, as well as showing blatant favouritism as a judge of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] to increase the chances that his [[Durmstrang Institute|school]]'s champion, [[Viktor Krum]], would win. Karkaroff's betrayal of his Death Eater comrades to avoid [[Azkaban]], as well as his going into hiding following [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s return, indicate that he was not at all a brave nor loyal man, somewhat similar to [[Peter Pettigrew]], who betrayed the [[Order of the Phoenix]] out of fear as well. During his trial, Igor feigned regret and flattery to the judges, showing him to be a talented actor and liar, a skill [[Sirius Black]] informed [[Harry Potter]] of. 

Despite his position as headmaster of Durmstrang, he showed neither responsibility nor care for his students, as he encouraged an atmosphere of fear and intimidation at Durmstrang while it was under his stewardship, forcing his students to steer the ship while he stayed in the cabin, harshly scolding [[Poliakoff]] in contrast to doting on the famous Krum, and then ultimately abandoned all of them to protect his own life, showing his immense selfishness, egotism and cowardice.<ref name="GOF30" /> 

{{Quote|Karkaroff did not steer. He stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork.|[[Viktor Krum]] about Karkaroff's selfish refusal to steer the Durmstrang ship|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
His membership in the Death Eater organisation and implementation — or, at least, continuation — of a policy of refusing to admit [[Muggle-born]]s to [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], indicated that Karkaroff was prejudiced against those of different [[blood status]] (though if so he had did not seem to have the level of sadistic, genocidal hatred possessed by other Death Eaters such as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]]). Nevertheless, Karkaroff was (at least during his time with the Death Eaters), something of a sadist, as he was noted to have assisted Dolohov in torturing Muggles, and even after he 'reformed' during his headship of Durmstrang, he encouraged an environment where intimidation and fear rule over the school, leading parents to see him as unprincipled and egotistical. Even his warm greeting to Albus Dumbledore when he came to Hogwarts was less proof of a civil nature, and more proof of his ability to play at civility when it suited him. This is supported by his later yelling at Dumbledore after Harry Potter's name came out of the Goblet of Fire, and even spitting at his feet.<ref name="GOF"/> 

Although Karkaroff proved himself to be a skilled actor and liar, he was also poor with controlling his emotions, as his short-temper led him to become increasingly angry and rude at Dumbledore and the British Ministry of Magic for allowing Harry to participate in the Triwizard Tournament that culminated to him spitting in front of Dumbledore's feet. His lack of bravery led him to continuously bombard Snape about the Dark Mark's increasing colour, constantly expressing a worried tone and expression.<ref name="GOF"/>  

Karkaroff seemed to have been a reasonably skilled [[Wizardkind|wizard]], as it was said that it was impressive how he remained hidden from Voldemort for so long after the latter's rebirth, although Voldemort was keeping a low profile during the Ministry's denial, and that Karkaroff's death occurred shortly after the Ministry finally saw and accepted Voldemort's return further enforces this as a reason for his year-long survival. He was able to gain knowledge of a good number of Death Eaters' identities, despite Voldemort's tight secretive operations, including the otherwise undiscovered spy [[Augustus Rookwood]], showing that he was at least skilled in intelligence gathering.<ref name="GOF" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|And since he got out, from what I can tell, he's been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his.|[[Sirius Black]] regarding Karkaroff's skill for the Dark Arts|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
While the extent of his [[magic]]al skills is unknown, Karkaroff must have been a skilled wizard, given that he was the Headmaster of [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]] as well as a former [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. His skills were such that he was able to evade the likes of [[Alastor Moody]] and even [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] himself for extended periods of time.<ref name="GOF"/>
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a former Death Eater, Karkaroff would have been highly skilled in the Dark Arts. According to [[Alastor Moody]], Karkaroff was proficient with the [[Unforgivable Curses]]. He was also able to evade the aforementioned veteran [[Auror]] for six months. More impressive still was that he successfully managed to stay hidden from [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] himself for an entire year, presumably using various spells and enchantments (although whether these spells were Dark Magic is unknown) to make it harder for the Dark Lord to track him. Furthermore, whilst he was the Headmaster of Durmstrang, he encouraged the teaching of the [[Dark Arts (class)|Dark Arts]] as an academic subject, heavily implying that despite his abandonment of the Death Eaters and their cause, he was still a dedicated [[Dark Wizard]].<ref name="GOF"/> 
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Karkaroff once summoned a number four in the sky after the First Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] to evaluate [[Harry Potter]]'s performance without saying an [[incantation]], showing he was skilled with nonverbal spells.<ref name="GOF20">{{GOF|B|20}}</ref>
*'''Acting skills''': Karkaroff was a very skilled actor and was able to convince others about his apparently benevolent convictions deceptively. During his trial before the [[Council of Magical Law]], he successfully feigned flattery to the judges as well as remorse for his crimes, which could have significantly helped his lenient sentencing and eventual release from Azkaban. This shows he was able to successfully and very likely dishonestly persuade very accomplished individuals of his supposed good will, although he failed to convince more cynical and observant individuals such as [[Alastor Moody]], who suspected he was being disingenuous. His notable acting ability was, however, noted by Sirius Black, who warned Harry Potter of his deceptive and cunning nature. In truth, he did not remotely see the errors of his ways. He was able to put on the facade of a civil professional during his visit to Hogwarts, though this became mitigated by his rising short-temper of Harry's selection and fear of Lord Voldemort, causing him to throw tantrums at Dumbledore or annoyingly bombard Snape.<ref name="GOF"/>

==Possessions==
*'''[[Igor Karkaroff's wand|Wand]]''': Igor Karkaroff owned a [[wand]] of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material.<ref name="GOF20"/>
*'''[[Igor Karkaroff's walking stick|Walking stick]]''': Igor Karkaroff owned a walking stick that he carried with him during the [[Welcoming Feast]].
*'''[[Igor Karkaroff's dress robes|Dress robes]]''': Igor Karkaroff owned white dress robes that he wore to the [[Yule Ball]].

==Relationships==
===Severus Snape===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Karkaroff|Well? Do you see? It's never been this clear, never since — |Severus Snape|Put it away!|But you must have noticed —|We can talk later, Karkaroff!|Igor and Snape discussing their [[Dark Mark]]s|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Severus Snape Profile.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Severus Snape]], a former fellow Death Eater]]
In his younger days, Karkaroff was a friend and comrade of [[Severus Snape]]. After Voldemort's first downfall, Karkaroff was caught by Aurors and briefly imprisoned in [[Azkaban]]. He betrayed many Death Eaters in order to avoid remaining in Azkaban. One of them was Snape, which might have indicated a strained relationship after Snape's betrayal. Karkaroff learned that Snape had abandoned the Death Eaters and become a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], and therefore Karkaroff was dismayed to hear yet another one of his names was useless.<ref name="GOF30"/>      

Karkaroff met Snape again in [[1994]], during the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. When his [[Dark Mark]] began to burn, Karkaroff told Snape about it, because he knew that Snape had felt it too. Snape told him that he himself had nothing to be afraid of, and asked him if he (Karkaroff) could say the same. Snape certainly seemed more and more irritated by Karkaroff's constant bombardment on the issue, and continued to evade him more and more.<ref name="GOF"/> During the [[Yule Ball]], Snape also told [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] that Karkaroff was planning to escape if Voldemort returned. Snape added that he wasn't 'such a coward', and Dumbledore replied that Snape was 'a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff'.<ref name="DH33">{{DH|B|33}}</ref> After Voldemort's return, Karkaroff, unlike Snape, escaped [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and went into hiding. He was killed by Death Eaters some time in the next year. It is unknown how Severus Snape reacted when he learned of this.<ref name="GOF"/>

===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Quote|Treachery! It is a plot! You and your [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] have lured me here under false pretence, Dumbledore! This is not an equal competition! First you sneak [[Harry Potter|Potter]] into the [[Triwizard Tournament|Tournament]], though he is under-age! Now one of your [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Ministry friends]] attempts to put [[Viktor Krum|''my'' champion]] out of action! I smell double-dealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you, Dumbledore, you with your talk of closer international wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences — here's what I think of ''you''!|Karkaroff spitting at the ground of [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s feet|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]]]]
[[Albus Dumbledore]] was a participant of Karkaroff's trial. When Karkaroff stated that [[Severus Snape]] was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], Dumbledore declared that Snape had changed sides before the downfall of Voldemort. However, when [[Alastor Moody]] told Dumbledore that it was a good idea to take information off Karkaroff and send him to the [[Dementor]]s, Dumbledore disagreed.<ref name="GOF"/>

Karkaroff and Dumbledore met again during the [[Triwizard Tournament]], as they both were headmasters of their respective schools. It is possible that Karkaroff and Dumbledore knew each other better than they appeared to, as Karkaroff said 'the good old Hogwarts' when he visited the school, and this may imply that Karkaroff had his education at Hogwarts. He and Dumbledore seemed happy to see each other as they laughed and hugged in greeting. 

However, beneath this civil greeting was Dumbledore's belief that Karkaroff was a coward, or at least weak. And despite their initial greetings, when Harry was selected to be the second champion of the Triwizard Tournament, Karkaroff's interactions towards Dumbledore became more hostile; when Krum was attacked by who they thought was [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]], Karkaroff flew into a rage and spat at Dumbledore's feet. This resulted in [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who was loyal to Dumbledore, brutally pinning Karkaroff against a tree and demanding an apology.<ref name="GOF" />

===Lord Voldemort===
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Karkaroff? Where is he? Have you got him? Is he locked up?|Barty Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody)|Karkaroff fled tonight, when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm.

[[File:Lord Voldemort.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], his former master]]
Karkaroff served [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[First Wizarding War]], but was one of the [[Death Eaters]] who attempted to avoid being imprisoned in [[Azkaban]]. In order to manage this, he betrayed many Death Eaters, such as [[Antonin Dolohov]], [[Augustus Rookwood]] and [[Severus Snape]].<ref name="GOF30"/> He was also one of the Death Eaters who did not try to find Voldemort after his downfall.<ref name="GOF33"/> 

This made him fear the return of Voldemort and his loyal Death Eaters. After [[Return of the Dark Lord|Lord Voldemort's rebirth]], Karkaroff left Hogwarts and hid in a shack. However, Voldemort's Death Eaters found him and killed him.<ref name="HBP6" /> Voldemort condemned Karkaroff as a coward who needed to pay for his refusal to return.<ref name="GOF33">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref>

===Death Eaters===
{{Quote|And they've found Igor Karkaroff's body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it... well, frankly, I'm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters...|[[Remus Lupin]] regarding how Karkaroff was murdered by Death Eaters|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Death Eaters GOFF.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Death Eaters]]
Karkaroff betrayed many [[Death Eaters]] during his attempt to avoid imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. These Death Eaters included [[Antonin Dolohov]], [[Evan Rosier]], [[Travers]], [[Mulciber (Marauder-era)|Mulciber]] and [[Augustus Rookwood]]; he became desperate when he heard some of these Death Eaters were already caught or killed, worried they did not contribute to his own pardon as opposed to actually mourning for his comrades, as he feigned congratulations for the judges for these arrests. It is most likely that he had betrayed many other Death Eaters, as [[Sirius Black]] stated that Karkaroff had <nowiki>'</nowiki>''put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place''<nowiki>'</nowiki>. 

[[Bartemius Crouch Junior]] came to hate Igor for his disloyalty to Voldemort, and repeatedly intimidated him while disguised as [[Alastor Moody]], even musing on how Voldemort would easily track down a fleeing Karkaroff. On the other hand, fellow rogue Death Eater [[Lucius Malfoy]] apparently retained a positive relationship with Karkaroff, as he intended to send his son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] to Durmstrang, partially due to knowing the headmaster personally.<ref name="GOF" /> After [[Return of the Dark Lord|Voldemort's rebirth]], Karkaroff didn't return to Voldemort.<ref name="GOF33" /> He was eventually caught and killed by Death Eaters in [[1996]].<ref name="HBP6" />

===Alastor Moody===
{{Quote|Crouch is going to let him out. He's done a deal with him. Took me six months to track him down, and Crouch is going to let him go if he's got enough new names. Let's hear his information, I say, and throw him straight back to the dementors.|Moody's hatred of Karkaroff|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Alastor Moody Profile.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Alastor Moody]], an enemy]]
[[Alastor Moody]] was the [[Auror]] who captured Karkaroff after Voldemort's downfall, so naturally hated Karkaroff for being a Death Eater and a coward. He also participated in Karkaroff's trial, and told Dumbledore that they should take information from Karkaroff and then send him back to the [[Dementor]]s. However, Dumbledore refused.<ref name="GOF30"/> Moody and Karkaroff met again in [[1994]], during the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. In fact, he was not the real Alastor Moody, but [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], a fellow Death Eater. Nevertheless, Igor became very shocked and seemingly frightened upon seeing the face of the one who arrested him.<ref name="GOF16"/>

After [[Harry Potter]] was chosen for the Tournament, Karkaroff got very angry, because Hogwarts had two champions. When Barty (disguised as Moody) told him how the Goblet of Fire might have been fooled, Karkaroff told him that he thought like a [[Dark Wizard]]. Barty answered that it was his job to capture Dark Wizards, as Karkaroff should know, implying that Moody was, in part at least, responsible for Karkaroff's capture. Not knowing it was really Crouch, who hated Karkaroff as much as the real Moody, though for very different reasons, Karkaroff was careful around him not to give Moody a solid pretext for attacking him, backing off when the Auror showed signs of readying for battle, and pointing out Moody's paranoia to others around.<ref name="GOF"/>

Karkaroff was the Headmaster of the [[Durmstrang Institute]]. He treated his students like servants, making them steer the [[Durmstrang Ship]] while he stayed in his cabin.<ref name="GOF"/> He even encouraged an environment where intimidation and fear ruled over the institute, leading parents to see him as unprincipled and egotistical, and many of them withdrawing their children from the school as a result.<ref name="PM"/>

The only student Karkaroff seemed to respect and care about was [[Viktor Krum]], most likely because Krum was a famous professional [[Quidditch]] player prodigy, and Karkaroff thought that he would win the [[Triwizard Tournament]] for him. Karkaroff doted on Krum when he felt unwell after their journey to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], although he expressed no such concern for his other students. He constantly gave Viktor full marks on the tournament while giving the other champions less than what they deserve, and even provided his own champion information as part of the tournament's tradition of cheating. Karkaroff also refused to allow [[Muggle-born]] students to study at Durmstrang, and seemed to disapprove of Krum's relationship with Muggle-born [[Hermione Granger]].<ref name="GOF"/>

Disregarding how much he desired Viktor win the Triwizard Tournament, Karkaroff felt his own life was far more important, as the moment he felt Voldemort summoning all Death Eaters, he abandoned his care for the tournament's results and his students and fled faraway. They did not appear to miss him much after this.<ref name="GOF"/>

===Harry Potter===

Karkaroff was surprised when he met [[Harry Potter]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. However, after [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] put Harry's name into the [[Goblet of Fire]], Harry was chosen for the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. This made Karkaroff very angry, thinking that Harry and Dumbledore had cheated in order to win the Tournament. Harry, in turn, thought that Karkaroff was the one who put his name into the Goblet of Fire, and that he wanted to murder Harry.<ref name="GOF"/> 

Karkaroff, after failing to even things out due to Harry's selection, gave the fourth champion low scores while giving his own champion full marks, showing an incredible level of biased judgement. Harry was warned by Sirius Black about Karkaroff, who revealed him to be a Death Eater and a good actor, noting his trial. After [[Return of the Dark Lord|Voldemort's return]], Harry learned that Karkaroff was innocent (of putting his name into the Goblet), and that the responsible party was Barty Crouch Jnr Harry also learned that Karkaroff had left Hogwarts and fled into hiding.<ref name="GOF"/> [[1996|A year later]], Harry heard from [[Remus Lupin]] that Karkaroff had been murdered by [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="HBP6"/>

==Etymology==
*''Igor'' is a Slavic name derived from the Scandinavian name ''Ingvar'', meaning 'protected by Ing'; Ing the name of the norse goddess of fertility. Igor is also a stock character of horror literature and films, usually acting as a servant to the villain.<ref>{{wikilink|Igor (fictional character)}}</ref>
*''Karkar'' is a name which was common among Kipchaks<ref>[https://books.google.de/books?id=eXfJDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT37&lpg=PT37&dq=%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80+%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%8F&source=bl&ots=OP9GVK85wH&sig=_rx6OoVVgaCsk5DznMunyj-fY7M&hl=bg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi27eDvqPncAhXLb1AKHfWvAVUQ6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%20%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%8F&f=false Google books]</ref>, a Turkic tribe which inhabited today's Kazakhstan during ca. 10-12c.; ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>-off<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' is a possessive suffix meaning ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>[son] of<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' in Slavic languages turning a given name into a surname which was also attached to non-Slavic names as part of Russification policies in the former USSR.   
*<nowiki>'</nowiki>''Kark''<nowiki>'</nowiki> also means <nowiki>'</nowiki>''the unsettled''<nowiki>'</nowiki> in Turkish.   
*Also, in several Slavic languages such as Russian ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>kar''<nowiki>'</nowiki> is an onomatopoeia word, which represents the sound crows make (an equivalent to English <nowiki>'</nowiki>''caw''<nowiki>'</nowiki>). 
*Karkaroff is also an alternate name for [[lotr:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]] the [[werewolf]] from [[lotr:J.R.R. Tolkien |J.R.R Tolkien]]'s ''[[lotr:The Silmarillion|The Silmarillion]]''. It translates as 'The Red Maw'.

*Karkaroff was portrayed by [[Predrag Bjelac]] in {{GOF|FA}}. He was credited as 'Pedja Bjelac' in the end credits. He worked with [[Warwick Davis]] in the 2008 film ''[[wikipedia:The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian|The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]'', which he was also credited as 'Pedja'.
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Karkaroff also turned in [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] for [[Cruciatus Curse|torturing]] [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]].
*Based on his name, Karkaroff was most likely from a Slavic country, which may have been either [[Russia]] or [[Bulgaria]] where surnames with the ''off -''suffix are most commonly found. 
*Karkaroff's murder is never mentioned in {{HBP|FA}}, neither by the characters nor the headlines of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. However, there is an image in {{HPLE}} of a ''Daily Prophet'' article talking about Karkaroff's murder, possibly hinting that it was originally designed for the film before getting scrapped through unknown reasons, possibly as Karkaroff's mention wasn't relevant to the story.<ref> {{HPLE}} {{see image|File:DailyProphetKarkaroff.png}}</ref>  
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Karkaroff cannot use [[Dark Arts|Dark magic]] despite having once been a Death Eater. However, this may be because he had defected prior to when the game takes place. In the DS version of {{LEGO|Y2}}, however, his character is able to perform it. 
*In the book, Karkaroff's hair was white, but in the film it was black and silver. His hair is shown to be black during his trial in [[1980]]-[[1981|81]] in both the book and the film. In the book his eyes were also blue, but in the film they are brown.
