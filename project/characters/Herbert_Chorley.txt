'''Herbert Chorley''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Junior minister]] in [[1996]]. He was placed under a botched [[Imperius Curse]], leaving him acting like a [[duck]]. [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] officials placed him in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] for treatment. It was stated that he nearly strangled three of the [[healer]]s, and therefore had to be removed from [[Muggle world|Muggle society]] for a while.<ref name="HBP1">{{HBP|B|1}}</ref> It is unknown if he ever recovered.

==Etymology==
The name "Herbert" is derived from the Germanic elements hari "army" and beraht "bright". The Normans introduced this name to England, where it replaced an Old English cognate Herebeorht.
