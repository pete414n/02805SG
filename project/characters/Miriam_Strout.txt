{{Quote|A motherly-looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and the others.|Description|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Madam Miriam Strout''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] or [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Healer]] on the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]. She was described to be a motherly-looking healer.<ref name="OOTP23"/>

==Biography==
During her youth, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. In her adult years, she once commented to [[Jacob's sibling]] that [[Herbology]] was not her best [[Hogwarts subjects|subject]] at school.<ref name="Healing-hands">{{HM|7|19|Healing Hands}}</ref>

Strout was a good friend of [[Talbott Winger]]'s [[Talbott Winger's mother|mother]], a fellow Healer employed at St Mungo's and a [[White Swan]] [[Animagus]]. Upon her tragic [[death]], Strout was heartbroken, and in response, her [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] changed to the shape of a White Swan, to commemorate her. She would often let it patrol the hospital to remind her of Talbott Winger's mother doing the same.<ref name="HM728"/>

{{Quote|It's so wonderful to see you, my little lambs! Welcome to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies. My name is Miriam Strout and I'll be your supervisor while you're here! The [[Healing magic|healing arts]] are complex and vital to the [[wizarding world]], but I'll be here to help you along! For your school project, you'll be learning about the foundations of healing and what it means to be a Healer.|Miriam Strout greeting seventh-year Hogwarts students to the hospital|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
[[File:Miriam Strout greeting students in St Mungo's HM719.png|thumb|250px|Miriam Strout greeting seventh-year students to the hospital|left]]
During this school year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Strout helped [[seventh year|seventh-year]] students visiting St Mungo's to complete assignments as part of their [[St Mungo's student programme|work experience]] at the hospital.<ref name="HM719">{{HM|7|19}}</ref><ref name="HM720">{{HM|7|20}}</ref><ref name="HM721">{{HM|7|21}}</ref><ref name="HM724"/>

During this time, she treated [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] in the hospital, who had been suffering from life-threatening [[Fire|burns]],<ref name="HM721"/> that were caused by the [[dark charm]] ''[[Protego Diabolica]]''. [[Jacob's sibling]] informed Strout of the nature of Jacob's injuries once they had realised it themselves, and Strout immediately modified his treatment, managing to successfully save his life.<ref name="HM723">{{HM|7|23}}</ref>

Strout became a victim of the [[laughing curse]] that was attached to a [[cursed CD case]] that been given to Jacob at the hospital as a supposed get-well gift.<ref name="HM725">{{HM|7|25}}</ref><ref name="HM726"/> With Strout bedridden due to the curse, which made her not stop laughing, the hospital fell into disarray with her patients becoming restless.<ref name="HM726">{{HM|7|26}}</ref> Thankfully, Jacob's sibling destroyed the cursed CD case at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and Strout and the others were freed of the curse. She treated the affected patients with [[lozenge]]s and fortifying broth. She then proceeded to inform Talbott Winger, [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] and their sibling of her White Swan Patronus, and how it reflected her friendship with Talbott's mother, as the presence of her Patronus had mystified the students. She also gifted Talbott with his mother's [[St Mungo's Certified Healer Insignia]], with Talbott commenting that he intended to become a Healer himself.<ref name="HM728"/>

Jacob's sibling asked Strout if she knew anyone called [[Burke]] whilst she was busy in the Alchemy Room, whom they suspected was a [[Dark Wizard]] responsible for the laughing curse outbreak. She was surprised at this suggestion, she told them Burke was a resident healer who had worked at the hospital for many years, and she said she planned to talk to him, but had to urgently leave to attend a meeting.<ref name="HM729">{{HM|7|29}}</ref>

She later told Jacob's sibling their work experience had finished when [[Alastor Moody]] came to pick them and Jacob up. She thanked them for their work immensely and told them they would achieve great things.<ref name="HM730">{{HM|7|30}}</ref>

{{Quote|Look, Broderick, you've been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy [[Hippogriff]] for each month.|Miriam Strout's fatal mistake|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:B5C23M1 Christmas at St Mungo's.png|thumb|250px|right|Miriam Strout tending to patients in the Janus Thickey Ward at Christmas]]
Strout was responsible for looking after long-term patients such as [[Agnes]], [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], and [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]]. When [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] came up to the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] by accident, she led them in, mistaking them wanting to visit Lockhart, who had managed to sneak out of his room for a while.<ref name="OOTP23">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref>

She was also looking after [[Broderick Bode]] when he was killed by a [[Devil's Snare]] plant sent to him by the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Walden Macnair]], disguised at the time as an elderly wizard. Although [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] had very strict regulations of the gifts allowed into the hospital, Strout mistook the Devil Snare to be a harmless [[Flitterbloom]] and thought the improving Bode could take care of it, a dreadful mistake which cost him his life. She was suspended on full pay whilst the matter was investigated and was unavailable for comments for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.<ref name="OOTP25">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref> It is unknown if Strout was eventually fired or reinstated in her position.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Oh Gilderoy, you’ve got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas Day too! Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can’t think why, he’s such a sweetie, aren’t you?|Strout's compassion for Gilderoy Lockhart|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Strout was evidently a very caring and kind-hearted witch, given her job as a [[Healer]], meaning she specialised in tending to the both the physically and mentally unwell, in the [[Janus Thickey Ward]]. She was very mothering and protective of her vulnerable patients, such as [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], who she even seemed to feel much compassion for, since he received no visitors.<ref name="OOTP23"/> However, she was somewhat naive and inattentive in her professional duties, as she foolishly failed to identify a lethal [[Devil's Snare]] plant that had been brought into her hospital ward (mistaking it for a harmless [[Flitterbloom]]), a thoughtless mistake which resulted in her patient [[Broderick Bode]] being killed by the plant, and her being suspended from her position.<ref name="OOTP25"/>

*'''[[Healing magic]]''': As a professional [[Healer]] working at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], Strout was highly proficient in the art of medical [[magic]]. She worked in the [[Janus Thickey Ward]], meaning she was very able in looking after people who had suffered permanent [[spell]] damage.<ref name="OOTP23"/> In addition, in order to have trained as a Healer, she would have needed [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]] in [[Charms (class)|Charms]], [[Potions (class)|Potions]], [[Herbology]], [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], all at least "[[Exceeds Expectations]]" or "[[Outstanding]]" level.<ref name="OOTP29">{{OOTP|B|29}}</ref> Despite Herbology being a requirement, she failed to identify a cutting of Devil's Snare, mistaking it for a harmless Flitterbloom, costing Bode his life.<ref name="OOTP25"/>

*'''[[Charm]]s''': Strout was highly capable in charm-work, given how a N.E.W.T. was required in [[Charms (class)|Charms]] for all Healers;<ref name="OOTP29"/> furthermore, she was capable of unlocking the locked door to the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] with the [[Unlocking Charm]], as well as fixing a [[fancy hippogriff calendar]] to the wall with her [[wand]] for [[Broderick Bode]].<ref name="OOTP23"/> She could also produce a fully corporeal [[Patronus|Patronus]] in the form of a [[White Swan]], which changed form to resemble the [[Animagus]] form of [[Talbott Winger's mother]].<ref name="HM728"/>
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Strout was knowledgeable of various healing potions,<ref name="HM719"/> and was skilled in brewing them at St Mungo's in the [[Alchemy Room]] in order to heal her patients.<ref name="HM720">{{HM|7|20}}</ref> [[Potions (class)|Potions]] was also a required qualification for Healers like Strout.<ref name="OOTP29"/>
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': As a Healer, she would have needed an O.W.L. in this subject at either "Exceeds Expectations" or "Outstanding".<ref name="OOTP29"/> Strout was able to heal [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] of life-threatening [[Fire|burns]] sustained from the powerful [[dark charm]] ''[[Protego Diabolica]]'', showing she was skilled with dealing with medical conditions caused by the [[Dark Arts]].<ref name="HM723">{{HM|7|23}}</ref>
