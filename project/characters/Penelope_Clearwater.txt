The petrifications were described as a series of 'four attacks on Muggle-borns' in {{COS|B|14}} and Ginny Weasley (possessed by [[Tom Riddle's diary|Tom Riddle's memory]]) was described as having 'set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat' in {{COS|B|17}}. However, it is possible that the fourth Muggle-born in addition to Colin, Hermione, and Justin (who are all definitively identified as Muggle-borns at some point) was Nearly-Headless Nick, and that Penelope was simply petrified because she was with Hermione when she encountered the [[Basilisk]]. In {{DH|B|23}}, Hermione posed as Penelope when under interrogation by [[Snatchers]], and claimed to be [[half-blood]]. Although, Hermione may have only lied about Penelope's blood status because mentioning she's Muggle-born would have possibly made things worse.</ref>

'''Penelope 'Penny' Clearwater''' (born c. [[1975]] or [[1976]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1987]] to [[1994]]. In her later school years, she was a [[Prefect]], and eventually started dating [[Percy Weasley]], a [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor student]] and a fellow [[Prefect]].<ref name="C18" /> 

After she finished her education at Hogwarts, Penelope and Percy never married. It can be assumed that they broke up at some point. Percy married another woman named [[Audrey Weasley]] instead.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Penelope was born in c.[[1975]] or [[1976]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]]. She was either from a [[Non-magic people|muggle]] family or had both muggle and magical heritage.<ref name="bloodstatus" />

===Hogwarts years {{c|1987-1994}}===

====Early years====
Penelope Clearwater arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1987]]{{fact}} and upon her arrival was [[Sorting Hat|Sorted]] into the [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] of [[Ravenclaw]].

====Sixth year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Ron Weasley (as Vincent Crabbe)|Excuse me. We've forgotten the way to our common room.|Penelope Clearwater|I beg your pardon? Our common room? I'm a Ravenclaw.|Penelope's suspicions towards a disguised Ron Weasley|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
In the summer of [[1992]], [[Percy Weasley]] wrote many letters to her and met up with her in secret throughout the next school year.<ref name="C18">{{COS|B|18}}</ref> On [[25 December]] [[1992]], Penelope<ref name="C14"/> was asked for directions by [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], who had disguised themselves as [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] with [[Polyjuice Potion]], while they were wandering around looking for the [[Slytherin Dungeon|Slytherin common room]]. She did not trust them, and told them that being in Ravenclaw, she could not help them.<ref name="C12">{{COS|B|12}}</ref>

[[File:Petrified.jpg|245px|thumb|left|A petrified Penelope in the Hospital Wing]]
In the same year, the [[Chamber of Secrets]] had been opened, unleashing a 'monster' that was hunting down [[Muggle-born]] students. [[Hermione Granger]] deduced that it was a [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]], and as she rushed to inform her friends, she met Penelope as the first person she bumped into, and told her to use her [[Penelope Clearwater's mirror|mirror]] to look around corners to spot the [[Snake|serpent]].<ref name="C16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref> 

Penelope and Hermione made good use of Penelope's [[Penelope Clearwater's mirror|mirror]] to navigate the school hallways, but they looked the [[Basilisk]] in the eye through the reflection of the mirror, [[petrification|petrifying]] them both.<ref name="C16"/> Penelope and Hermione were then hospitalised in the [[Hospital Wing]], with the other petrified students.<ref name="C14"/> Percy was known to be very upset with Penelope's unfortunate petrification.<ref name="C14">{{COS|B|14}}</ref> Penelope was eventually revived with a [[Mandrake Restorative Draught|draught]] prepared from [[Mandrake]] roots, along with Hermione and the other victims.<ref name="C18"/>

Before the end of the school year, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] walked in on Penelope kissing Percy in an empty classroom. He told her to keep it secret, but she later told on them.<ref name="C18" />

====Seventh year====
By the summer of [[1993]], Penelope was still dating Percy who had a picture of her at home. When someone spilt [[tea]] on it, Percy was upset and blamed Ron, who said Penelope hid her face because she had a blotchy nose.<ref name="P5">{{POA|B|5}}</ref>

In September 1993, while on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]], Penelope was approached by an excited Percy, wanting to show her the shiny new badge he had for being made Head Boy.<ref name="P5" />

Penelope appeared to be a serious [[Quidditch]] fan, having appreciated [[Harry Potter]]'s new [[broomstick]], a [[Firebolt]], greatly, and betting ten galleons on the outcome of the [[Ravenclaw]] vs [[Gryffindor]] match with Percy. When she wanted to hold the broomstick, Percy heartily told her not to sabotage them by doing so.<ref name="P13">{{POA|B|13}}</ref>

When Ravenclaw later lost, Percy congratulated Harry and then went to find Penelope to receive the ten galleons she owed him.<ref name="P13" /> Penelope later listened to Percy, the only one to do so, when he explained he would make lots of proposals about the Magical Law Enforcement when he could.<ref name="P22">{{POA|B|22}}</ref>

Sadly, she did not end up marrying her Hogwarts boyfriend, as Percy eventually married a woman named [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey]] and had two children with her.

==Physical appearance==
Penelope was described as having long, curly hair.<ref name="C12" />

==Possessions==
[[File:PenelopeClearwaterMirror.png|thumb|Her personal mirror]]
*'''[[Wand]]''': Penelope owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[Wand core|core]].<ref name="LEGOY1"/><ref name="LEGOY2"/> She presumably purchased it from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]], before starting her [[first year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1987]].
*'''[[Penelope Clearwater's mirror|Mirror]]''': Penelope owned an ornate hand mirror, which was useful for looking around corners. When she encountered the [[Serpent of Slytherin]] in [[1993]], the [[Basilisk]]'s deadly gaze was reflected by the mirror's glass and only resulted in her and [[Hermione Granger]] being [[Petrification|petrified]], saving both their lives.<ref name="C16"/>
*'''[[Prefect badge]]''': Having been a [[Ravenclaw]] [[Prefect]] whilst at Hogwarts, Penelope owned a Ravenclaw Prefect badge, which she would have worn during her official Prefect duties.<ref name="C16"/>

==Relationships==
===Percy Weasley===
{{Quote|He's been meeting her all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was — you know — attacked. You won't tease him, will you?|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] on Percy and Penelope's relationship|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[File:Peciee.PNG|228x228px|thumb|left|[[Percy Weasley]], her ex-boyfriend]]
In the summer of [[1992]], Percy and Penelope wrote many letters to each other.<ref name="C18" /> She began dating Percy Weasley in her [[1992–1993 school year|fifth year]], but they kept it secret. They would meet in deserted classrooms to kiss, but were caught once by Percy's sister, Ginny.<ref name="C18" />

Percy was distraught when Penelope was [[petrification|petrified]] in [[1993]]<ref name="C18" />, and immensely relieved when she was cured by the [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]].<ref name="C16" /> The secret came out when Ginny revealed the truth to her brothers, asking them not to tease Percy over the fact, which they did anyway.<ref name="C18" />

With the secret out, Percy and Penelope appeared in public together, and he kept a photo of her. During his stay at the [[Leaky Cauldron]] before the start of his seventh year, he accused Ron of dripping tea on it.<ref name="P5" />

Percy was excited to see her on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9¾]], wanting to show her the Head Boy badge he was given<ref name="P5" /> and, later in the year, wagered ten [[Galleon]]s on the outcome of the [[Gryffindor]] vs [[Ravenclaw]] match, despite not actually having ten galleons. He playfully remarked to her about sabotaging Harry's [[Firebolt]] when she asked if she could touch it. He was unafraid of asking Penelope for the ten galleons she later owed him,<ref name="P13" /> while she would be the only who cared to listen to him while he ranted at a later date.<ref name="P22" />

For unknown reasons, Percy and Penelope did not stay together, and Percy ended up marrying [[Audrey Weasley]].

==Etymology==
*In ''The Odyssey'', [[Wikipedia:Penelope|Penelope]] was the wife of Odysseus. While he was away fighting the Trojan Wars, she was pursued by many suitors; to hold them off, Penelope told them she would choose one when she finished weaving a shroud, but unravelled her work every night to prevent this from occurring. The poetic sense of the name is a faithful, clever, woman, particularly a wife. It is derived from the Greek words ''pene'', 'web', and ''ōps'', meaning 'eye' or 'face', although it is questionable; the name can also mean 'weaver' or 'duck'.
*The name is also possibly derived from the Greek name 'penelops' for a kind of [[duck]] that was said to have rescued and nurtured Penelope when she was exposed to die as an infant.
*Clearwater is a descriptive place name that suggests her ancestors lived near a body of [[water]] (which could be why her name may mean 'duck').

[[File:Penelope Clearwater.png|thumb|Penelope Clearwater in {{LEGO|Y2}}|158x158px]]
*In {{COS|FA}}, Penelope is not a victim of the Basilisk, and only appears when she and [[Percy Weasley]] are walking from the [[Great Hall]] during the first day of term, and are met and greeted by [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]], and later, in the crowd during the [[Duelling Club]]. She is also present at the [[End-of-Term Feast]]. She is played by [[Gemma Padley]].
*Early printings of ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' make Penelope a [[fifth year]] student, making her a year below Percy. Later printings revise this to make her a [[sixth year]].
*Despite Penelope graduated from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1994]], she is depicted as a Hogwarts student in {{LEGO|Y2}}, which is set from [[1995]] onwards. This was probably done simply for aesthetic reasons.<ref name="LEGOY2"/>
