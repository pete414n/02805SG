{{Quote|Bad news, Harry. I've just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. She — er — got a bit shirty with me. Told me I'd got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn't care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch on it first. Honestly, the way she was yelling at me... you'd think I'd said something terrible.|Wood's intense devotion to [[Quidditch]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
'''Oliver Wood''' (born c. [[1975]] or [[1976]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was the [[Keeper]] and [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] during his time as a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], which he attended from [[1987]] to [[1994]]. 

Oliver was known for his determination and skill on the playing field, and his long lectures before practices. He led the Gryffindor team to victory in the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] in his [[seventh year]].

After leaving school, Oliver joined [[Puddlemere United]] as a reserve player (presumably as Keeper). In [[1998]], Oliver returned to Hogwarts to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]], alongside his former school friends and teammates.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Oliver was born in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]] in [[1975]] or [[1976]], likely into a wizarding family.

===Hogwarts years {{C|1987–1994}}===
[[File:Oliver DADA class.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Oliver during a [[fifth year]] [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson]]
Oliver Wood attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1987]] to [[1994]]. He was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] and presumably shared a [[Gryffindor Boys' Dormitory|dormitory]] with [[Percy Weasley]]. 

He joined the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] as a [[Keeper]]. During his first game he took a [[Bludger]] to the head two minutes in, and woke up a week later in the [[Hospital Wing]]. He mentioned this to [[Harry Potter]] when Oliver was in his fifth year, as Harry was nervous for his first [[Quidditch]] match. Oliver also mentioned that he didn't really remember his first match because of this.

He also attended Hogwarts with [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] and [[Hufflepuff]] [[Nymphadora Tonks]] for four years before they graduated.  Oliver would frequently talk about Charlie's superb Quidditch skills and showed appreciation for them, as he was a huge Quidditch fan himself.

Sometime before 1991, Oliver was given an "''award for effort''".

Oliver once borrowed {{QTA}} from the [[Hogwarts Library]] and was due to return the book on [[9 April]] in an unknown year.

====Gryffindor Quidditch Captain====
{{Dialogue a-b|Fred Weasley|We know Oliver's speech by heart. We were in the team last year.|Oliver|Shut up, you two. This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years. We're going to win. I know it.|Discussion of Oliver's speech|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Oliver became Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in either [[1990]], his fourth year or [[1991]], his fifth year.

In the [[1991–1992 school year]], despite assembling a good team, he was unable to find anyone skilled enough to play as [[Seeker]] for the team after the departure of [[Charles Weasley]] in the previous year. However, his search was ended when his [[Head of House]], [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], observed [[Harry Potter]] catch [[Neville Longbottom]]'s [[Remembrall]] on a [[broomstick]] from a fifty foot dive. McGonagall claimed that it was a move that even Charlie Weasley couldn't have pulled off, convincing Oliver that Harry was indeed something special. He immediately saw that Harry's build was perfect for a Seeker, and impressed upon McGonagall the need for Harry to have a decent [[Broomstick|broom]] to fly.

[[File:Oliver teaching Harry.jpg|250px|thumb|Oliver gave Harry his first Quidditch lesson in private]]
Oliver gave Harry his first Quidditch lesson in private, immediately seeing that Harry was a natural flyer on a broomstick. Wanting to use Harry as a secret weapon during the first match of the season against [[Slytherin]], Oliver tried to keep his presence on the team under wraps. Despite his best efforts, however, word got out about Harry's presence, although his skill level was a secret from everyone outside the team.

[[File:Oliver wood ps.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Oliver and his team preparing for the first match of the Quidditch season]]
Captaining the side against their nemesis, Slytherin, in the first game of the season, Oliver was delighted when Harry captured the [[Golden Snitch]] in his first match, winning the game for Gryffindor. However, the second game of the season, against [[Hufflepuff]], gave Oliver cause for concern, when he found out that [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] would be refereeing the match in place of [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]]. Fearing that Snape would not be fair to Gryffindor following their defeat of Slytherin, he urged Harry to catch the Snitch as soon as possible. When he caught it within five minutes, Oliver was overjoyed. If Gryffindor could beat [[Ravenclaw]] in the final match of the season, then they would surely capture the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]].

Shortly after, Gryffindor House lost one hundred and fifty house points due to the actions of three first year students, including Harry Potter. Harry offered his resignation to Oliver, who declined it, his reasoning being that if they didn't win at Quidditch, they had no chance to recoup the lost points. Despite this, Oliver likely felt somewhat irked towards Harry, as, during team practice sessions, his angry teammates simply referred to Harry as "the Seeker".

The final match of the season against [[Ravenclaw]] was a disaster. Harry was in the hospital wing after facing [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and recovering the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. Without Harry and his Nimbus 2000 broomstick, the Gryffindor team suffered its biggest defeat

====Sixth year====
{{Quote|It'll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father.  Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we've got to win today, we've got to.|Oliver telling Harry to catch the snitch at any cost|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Oliver-Wood-quidditch.jpg|250px|thumb|Oliver walking with his team on the way to Quidditch practise]]
Oliver spent the summer of [[1992]] devising an entirely new training schedule that included early morning practice sessions. He was determined to win the Cup, and his enthusiasm for regular training sessions knew no limits. He was annoyed that his team did not seem to be taking it as seriously as he was, but that may have been a result of getting them all up earlier than they expected on the day of their first training session.

On the first Saturday back at school, he booked the Quidditch pitch to begin training earlier than the other teams. His plan was cut short by the arrival of the Slytherin team, who had been given permission to use the pitch by Professor Snape in order to train their new Seeker, [[Draco Malfoy]].

[[File:Oliver keeper.gif|250px|thumb|left|Oliver Wood during a [[Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match (1992)|Gryffindor vs Slytherin match]]]]
Gryffindor won their first match of the season against Slytherin, but the unexplained attacks on [[Muggle-born]] students (later found to be caused by the reopening of the [[Chamber of Secrets]] and the freeing of the [[Serpent of Slytherin|monster]] within) forced the cancellation of the year's remaining matches. When [[Minerva McGonagall]] announced the good news that the school would not be closing, many students shouted "''Dumbledore's back''" or "''The heir of Slytherin has been caught''". Wood instead showed his intense love for Quidditch by shouting "''Quidditch matches are back on''."

====Seventh year====
{{Quote|This is our last chance — my last chance — to win the Quidditch Cup. I'll be leaving at the end of this year. I'll never get another shot at it.|Oliver's last shot at winning the cup|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
In his [[1993–1994 school year|final year]], Oliver Wood was especially desperate to win the Quidditch Cup. He knew that he had the best team in the whole school, and he felt that the Cup would have been Gryffindor's for the past two years if events hadn't so conspired against them. Training his team hard for the first match against [[Slytherin]], he was shocked to find out that Slytherin had indeed managed to postpone the match owing to an injury to their Seeker, [[Draco Malfoy]]. Malfoy, injured by [[Buckbeak|a hippogriff]] after insulting it during a [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lesson, was overplaying his injury to get out of playing the match during such extremely bad weather. Gryffindor were to then play Hufflepuff instead.

During the match, [[Harry Potter|Harry]] was overcome by [[Dementor]]s, who were attracted to the large gathering. He fell from his [[broomstick|broom]] while chasing the [[Golden Snitch]] and it was captured by the Hufflepuff Seeker, [[Cedric Diggory]]. When he realised what had happened, Cedric immediately offered Oliver a rematch, but Oliver declined it, knowing that Cedric had caught the Snitch fair and square, and assuring Harry that he didn't blame him for failing to catch the Snitch despite his previously impeccable record.

[[File:Oliver outside DADA.jpg|250px|thumb|Oliver talking to the Gryffindor Seeker Harry Potter]]
However, Oliver knew they still had a chance to win the Cup if they won their remaining matches and other results went their way. He urged Harry to buy a new broom, since his Nimbus 2000 had been destroyed by the [[Whomping Willow]] after the last match, and was also worried about the Dementors appearing again and affecting Harry. Harry assured him that [[Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] was teaching him to deal with Dementors, and that he had received a [[Firebolt]] broomstick for Christmas. 

Oliver was amazed, then disappointed to learn that [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] had confiscated it to check for signs of tampering or sabotage, as she feared that [[Sirius Black]] may have sent it to harm Harry. Oliver tried to appeal to McGonagall, telling her that having the Firebolt would greatly enhance their chances of winning the Quidditch Cup. McGonagall, however, accused Oliver of placing victory above Harry's life in his order of priorities. Finally, though, the Firebolt was given a clean bill of health, and returned to Harry, much to Oliver's joy.

In the run up to the second match of the season against [[Ravenclaw]], Oliver upped the training sessions to five times a week, and monitored the status of the Ravenclaw Seeker, [[Cho Chang]]. Knowing that she had a lot of trouble with injuries, he hoped that she would not be fit to play, and was disappointed to learn that she was able to. During the match, Oliver told Harry to stop being a gentleman and knock Cho off her broom if he had to.

[[File:Harry Potter Pottermore Harry Holding Quidditch Cup In A Crowd Moment.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Gryffindor wins the Quidditch Cup in 1994|]]
Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw, and other results went their way, meaning that, in the final game of the season against [[Slytherin]], if they could win by two hundred points, they would win the Cup. Oliver took to constantly reminding Harry that he must ''not'' catch the Snitch unless they were ahead by at least fifty points, and ordering that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, to prevent anyone from harming him before the game, which numerous Slytherins made it clear was a clear and present danger.

During the match against Slytherin, Oliver took two [[Bludger]]s to the stomach early in the game. Harry, though, managed to capture the Snitch when Gryffindor were ahead by at least sixty points, resulting in Gryffindor winning the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]]. Oliver, overjoyed, ecstatic and finally having achieved his dream, watched Harry lift the Cup aloft.

===Later life {{C|1994–1998}}===
{{Quote|Oliver Wood, the old captain of Harry's House [[Quidditch]] team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over to his parents' tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team.|Oliver at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, he was now a reserve member of Puddlemere United|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}[[File:1994 Quidditch World Cup WW.jpg|245x245px|thumb|Oliver attends the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] with his parents|alt=]]
After leaving Hogwarts, Oliver became the Keeper for [[Puddlemere United]]'s reserve team. In the summer of [[1994]], he attended the [[Quidditch World Cup]], along with his old classmates. It was at the World Cup that he saw Harry and introduced him to his parents and told Harry of his new career.

In [[1995]], Harry Potter made a joke with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] about how the new Gryffindor captain, [[Angelina Johnson]], seemed to be channelling Oliver's intense competitiveness, and that perhaps they should check with Puddlemere United that Oliver is still alive and hadn't been killed during a training session.

====Battle of Hogwarts====
{{Quote|You know what? I can manage him alone, [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]]|Oliver Wood carrying [[Colin Creevey]]'s corpse during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:DH2 Oliver Wood Battle of Hogwarts.gif|250px|thumb|left|Oliver Wood leading a group of students on broomsticks into battle|alt=]]In [[1998]], Oliver returned to Hogwarts along with former Gryffindor Quidditch players [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Katie Bell]], and [[Alicia Spinnet]] to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. During a lull in the battle, which was granted to them by Lord Voldemort as time to gather the dead, he assisted [[Neville Longbottom]] in carrying the dead bodies of [[Colin Creevey]] and [[Fallen Fifty|others]] into the [[Great Hall]]. 

Following the defeat and [[death]] of Voldemort at the hands of Harry Potter at the end of the Battle, Wood survived the battle, as his name was not mentioned among the [[Fallen Fifty]]. Afterwards, he likely continued with his career as a professional Quidditch player.

==Physical appearance==
Oliver was well built and burly, and had a commanding presence, especially to those in his team. He was known to get a maniacal look in his eyes when he was enthusing about Quidditch.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|I think we'd better check with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Wood's been killed during a training session, because Angelina seems to be channelling his spirit.|Oliver's intense and slightly manic personality|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Oliver Wood – COS.png|250px|thumb|Oliver in his fifth year|alt=]]
Wood was described as an intensely driven, competitive personality. He was singularly focused and determined to creating the best [[Quidditch team]] in the school. His ambition and dedication to the sport was such that he forced his players to train relentlessly, including early morning starts and all-weather training. Wood's obsession with winning occasionally became somewhat maniacal. 

In 1992 he told Harry to "''catch the Snitch or die trying''" and in [[1993]], [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] declared, with only mild exaggeration, that Wood was attempting to drown himself in the showers after a defeat as he refused to come out when they did. They also said in 1996 that "''Wood might have done the [[Slytherin]]s if he could have''," after someone asked who would try to kill off a Quidditch team. He regularly scheduled three practise sessions a week, rising to five a week before an important match. His overriding ambition was to win the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch cup]] before he graduated, a dream which he finally achieved in 1994.

Despite this, Wood was remarkably humble concerning his own skill, putting the team's success down to the other members of the team. He would often be more concerned about his teammates than himself, like urging them to eat breakfast before a match, yet touching nothing himself. He was also extremely loyal to Gryffindor and saw the success of the Gryffindor team as [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]'s success as a whole. He was also very fair; it was said by others that he didn't accept a replay after Harry fell off his broom against [[Cedric Diggory]] in 1993 since he felt that Diggory had caught the Snitch fairly, although it is unknown if this is true. He also assured Harry that he didn't blame him for the loss as he respected that there had to be at least one game where Harry wouldn't win.

Although he was fair-minded and approachable, Wood (which is an irony given his position as Captain of his team) appeared to struggle with interpersonal skills, as he often seemed oblivious to the way in which he came across to people. He never seemed to realise that his long-winded pep talks did not engage the rest of the team, and indeed frequently disgruntled them, possibly decreasing their motivation. After Harry's [[Firebolt]] was confiscated, Wood protested to [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] that he didn't care if it threw Harry off as long as he caught the Snitch on it first, apparently not understanding that this implied that he cared more about winning than about Harry's welfare. Despite this, he generally had a good relationship with the rest of the team.

Aside from his Quidditch skills, Oliver had the trademark courage and bravery of a true Gryffindor as, despite having graduated and having no obligation to do so, Oliver returned to Hogwarts to participate in the [[Battle of Hogwarts|battle]] against [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], and led fellow former Gryffindor Quidditch players [[Katie Bell]], [[Angelina Johnson]], and [[Alicia Spinnet]] into the battle with their brooms.

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Dialogue|George Weasley|We think you're very good too, Oliver.|Fred Weasley|Cracking [[Keeper]],|[[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] about Oliver's Keeping skills|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Oliver was [[Captain]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] during his fourth year onwards. He later became a professional [[Quidditch]] player for [[Puddlemere United]]'s reserve team on the position of [[Keeper]], showing him to have been an excellent and highly accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Though not much is known about his skills on the battlefield, he must have been an exceptional duellist to have been able to survive the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] with considerable proficiency in [[martial magic]]. 

==Possessions==
[[File:OliverWoodWandNN8258.jpg|thumb|Oliver's wand]]
*'''[[Oliver Wood's wand|Wand]]''': The wand of Oliver Wood was made of an unknown length, [[Wand core|core]] and [[Wand wood|wood]]. It was purchased by him, prior to his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in 1987, probably from the reputed [[wandmaker]] [[Garrick Ollivander]].
*'''[[Broomstick]]''': Considering Oliver was a dedicated [[Quidditch]] fan and player, Wood would have therefore owned his own broomstick which he would have flown with. 
*'''[[Oliver Wood's stopwatch|Stopwatch]]''': Oliver used his stopwatch during Quidditch training.

==Etymology==
The olive branch often is a symbol of peace. The olive tree's symbolism also includes a great harvest and long life. Wood is a place name (like Brooks or Field) and suggests ancestors who lived near or in a forest, or who were woodcutters. It is possible that Wood was meant to be the opposite of the name [[Marcus Flint|Flint]], the name of the [[Slytherin]] Quidditch team captain and Wood's rival.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Wod.jpg|150px|thumb|Oliver Wood as a LEGO mini-figure]]
[[File:Oliver Wood LEGO.png|thumb|Oliver Wood as he appears in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
[[File:Oliver Wood PAS.png|150px|thumb|Oliver Wood as he appears in {{PAS}}]]
*In {{PS|FA}}, when Oliver was explaining Quidditch to Harry Potter, he said that the team that catches the Snitch will win the game. This is inaccurate as in the World Cup in [[1994]], [[Viktor Krum]] caught the snitch, but Ireland won as they were ahead by more than 15 goals (150 points). However, he could have meant that the team would usually win the game due to the amount of points that the Snitch is worth (Incidentally, in {{GOF|FA}}, it is not revealed that Ireland won in this way). It is also possible that he was explaining the rules that Hogwarts usually played by.
*Oliver was portrayed by [[Sean Biggerstaff]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of {{PS}}, {{COS}} and {{DH|F2}}, although he did not match [[J. K. Rowling]]'s description of Wood as "burly." Biggerstaff portrayed Wood as a [[Scotland|Scot]], although this is never mentioned in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|books]]. Biggerstaff originally planned to audition using an English accent, but was encouraged by Chris Columbus to read the lines in his own Glaswegian dialect; thus Oliver Wood became Scottish in the films.
*Though Oliver was not a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], having left Hogwarts two years before its formation, Wood fought with [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. He was most likely alerted to the Battle of Hogwarts by former members of his Quidditch team who were members of Dumbledore's Army.
*Oliver did not know what basketball was. This suggests that he comes from a purely magical family. However, Oliver used golf balls when first practising with Harry Potter, suggesting he may be a half-blood, or at least has a family member who knows about golf.
*In {{DH|F2}},'' ''Oliver can be seen leading an aerial attack on [[Death Eaters]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].
*The hair and head pieces of the Oliver Wood minifigure in the {{LEGO}} sets are identical to those of the minifigure for [[w:c:indianajones:Mutt Williams|Mutt Williams]], a character from the [[w:c:indianajones:Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' series]].
