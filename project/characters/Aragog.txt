'''Aragog''' (c. [[1942]]–[[20 April]] [[1997]]) was an [[Acromantula]] owned by [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. Like the rest of his species, Aragog had a taste for [[human]] [[flesh]] and was able to communicate with humans with speech. In his youth, he was the size of a [[Pekingese]] and near the end of his life was about the size of a small [[elephant]] with an eighteen-foot leg span.<ref name="COS15">{{COS|B|15}}</ref>

Aragog had a wife, [[Mosag]], and was the leader of a large [[Forbidden Forest Acromantula colony|Acromantula colony]] composed of all of his sons and daughters.<ref name="COS15"/> During his life, Aragog was accused of being [[Serpent of Slytherin|Slytherin's Monster]],<ref name="COS15"/> although the monster was really a [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]].<ref name="COS16"/> Ironically, all [[spider]]s feared the [[basilisk]], as it was their mortal enemy.<ref name="COS15"/> After Aragog died, some of his [[Acromantula venom|venom]] was taken by [[Horace Slughorn]] and was most likely sold later on.<ref name="HBP22">{{HBP|B|22}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|I come from a distant land. A traveller gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg.|Aragog|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}Aragog was originally brought as an [[Acromantula egg|egg]] in a distant land and came to [[Great Britain]] in the pocket of a traveller. Somehow, the egg came into possession of [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who at the time was a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. After Aragog hatched from it, Hagrid kept him in a cupboard in one of the school's [[dungeons]], feeding him scraps.<ref name="COS13">{{COS|B|13}}</ref>

===Opening of the Chamber of Secrets===
{{Quote|They believed that ''I'' was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets.|Aragog|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[File:Youngaragog.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Aragog in his youth at Hogwarts]]

In 1943, [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]], a descendant of [[Salazar Slytherin]] who would later become [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], opened the Chamber of Secrets and unleashed the resident monster, the [[Serpent of Slytherin]], upon the castle to exterminate its [[Muggle-born]] population, those who were "unworthy" to study magic.<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref> Aragog was framed as being the monster and Hagrid was accused of being Slytherin's heir.<ref name="COS17"/> Several students were [[Petrification|petrified]] in the school after the monster were unleashed. But when one of its victims, [[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]], died in a [[Moaning Myrtle's Bathroom|bathroom]], it motivated the school's governors to consider closing the school.<ref name="COS16"/> Tom, who considered Hogwarts his only home, found out about Aragog after discovering the young Hagrid tending to the Acromantula, and realised he could use Aragog as a scapegoat for the monster's rampage. Tom came to capture the creature, but Hagrid helped Aragog escape to the [[Forbidden Forest]]. Hagrid was later punished with expulsion from the school for his alleged role in the attacks and for this course of action.<ref name="COS13"/> Aragog, meanwhile, was sent to live in the [[Forbidden Forest]].<ref name="COS15"/>

Hagrid, though expelled, was assigned the position of Gamekeeper at Hogwarts, by the intervention of [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] (who suspected his innocence), thus allowing him to stay in contact with Aragog.<ref name="COS13"/> Hagrid would visit Aragog now and then, bringing him food. On one particular visit, Hagrid brought Aragog a female Acromantula he could hopefully mate with, [[Mosag]].  The two Acromantulas started a large [[Forbidden Forest Acromantula colony|colony]] comprised of their children. Sometime later, Aragog became blind.<ref name="COS15"/>

===History repeats itself===
{{Quote|...Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.|Harry Potter, after speaking to Aragog and barely surviving an attack, while realising that Aragog was also innocent|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}In [[1993]], [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]] was unleashed on the castle again. This time, however, the rampage did not result in any deaths, only the [[petrification]] of several [[muggle-born]] students. Once again the governors considered closing the school due to the attacks. Governors of the school once again accused Hagrid of being the Heir of Slytherin. Hagrid vaguely told [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Harry Potter]] to "follow the [[spider]]s," but couched this advice in a statement to [[Minister for Magic]], [[Cornelius Fudge]], as they were both hiding under Harry's [[Cloak of Invisibility|invisibility cloak]]. Though reluctantly, the two decided to continue their investigation of the monster, and follow the spiders like Hagrid had indirectly told them. This led them into the [[Forbidden Forest]].<ref name="COS14">{{COS|B|14}}</ref>

[[File:Harry-potter2-movie-spider aragog.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Fang]] encounter Aragog and his offspring in the Forbidden Forest]]

Arriving at [[Aragog's Lair]], they encountered Aragog and his colony. Aragog revealed to them of Hagrid's innocence, the discovery of [[Myrtle Warren|Myrtle's]] body in the bathroom and added that he was not the Chamber's resident monster but however gave them a small clue of it; the monster was born in the castle unlike him and that his species never speak nor mention its name or anything about it as they fear it above other [[creature]]s, in no small part due to her malicious nature. He only revealed that the creature in the Chamber was ancient. Aragog told the two that while he showed mercy to Hagrid, he would not deny his many children fresh meat—even if they were Hagrid's friends. However, thanks to the [[Flying Ford Anglia]], Aragog's children failed to eat the two boys, as they both escaped the forest by flying away in the [[Charm|enchanted]] car.<ref name="COS15"/> After this, Harry and Ron actually found the real monster was in fact [[Serpent of Slytherin|a basilisk]],<ref name="COS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref> and the real heir, [[Tom Riddle]], who was of course none other than the [[Dark Wizard|Dark Lord]] Voldemort.<ref name="COS17"/>

Ron and Harry's encounter with Aragog and his colony made Ron's [[boggart]] manifest in the shape of Aragog, due to his arachnophobia and general fear of the Acromantula eating him.<ref name="AccioQuote">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-scholastic-chat.htm "About the Books: transcript of J.K. Rowling's live interview on Scholastic.com," Scholastic.com, 16 October 2000] at [http://www.accio-quote.org/index.html Accio Quote!]</ref><ref name="POA7">{{POA|B|7}}</ref>

===Death and post mortem===
{{Quote|Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won't forget! Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home.|Aragog's eulogy, delivered by [[Horace Slughorn]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
In [[1996]], Harry and [[Hermione Granger]], in an attempt to lure [[Dolores Umbridge]] into a trap in the [[Forbidden Forest]], took the path towards Aragog's colony, but the immediate danger of running into Aragog's children was avoided when the local [[Centaur]]s intercepted them.<ref name="OOTP33">{{OOTP|B|33}}</ref>
[[File:Aragog Funeral.png|250px|thumb|left|Horace Slughorn, Hagrid, [[Harry Potter]], and [[Fang]] attend Aragog's funeral]]
That same year, Aragog contracted an unknown illness over the summer, and despite Hagrid's attempts to heal and comfort Aragog by feeding him giant grubs,<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref> he eventually died on [[20 April]], [[1997]]. Before this time, it had been dangerous for Hagrid to go and visit Aragog because, sensing the giant spider's weakness, his family was getting rather restive and possibly preparing to devour him (Aragog). When Aragog died, Hagrid was able to get Aragog's corpse out of the colony before his children could attempt to cannibalise his corpse, though barely as they would no longer hold back in an attempt to devour Hagrid. Aragog was buried in a deep pit near Hagrid's house the next evening. [[Funeral of Aragog|Aragog's funeral]] was attended by Hagrid, Harry, and Professor [[Horace Slughorn]], who took the opportunity to "acquire" Aragog's highly valuable [[Acromantula venom|venom]].<ref name="HBP22"/>

In [[1998]], the Acromantula colony was forced out of the Forbidden Forest by Voldemort, his [[Death Eaters]] and his assembled army of [[Dark Arts|dark]] [[creature]]s, who then established their camp there as a prelude to the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Aragog's children survived, however, and invaded Hogwarts, attacking both the Death Eaters and the [[Hogwartian|defenders]] of Hogwarts. It is unknown if the colony and its population survived following the conclusion of the battle, which was in favour of the [[Order of the Phoenix]].<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was grey in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was blind.|Harry and Ron witnessing Aragog for the first time in his lair|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
In 1993, Aragog was described as being roughly the size of a small [[elephant]], with a grey and black hairy body, with milky white eyes, as he was blind.<ref name="COS15"/> However, it was likely his eyes were formerly black.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.|Aragog offering up Harry and Ron as food for his children|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Aragog.gif|thumb|220x220px|Aragog's eight-eyed stare]]
Aragog had a close friendship with his former owner, Hagrid. He admitted that it would have been his instinct to try to attack humans, but he restrained himself out of respect and gratitude for Hagrid, and unlike the basilisk herself, he never personally harmed a [[human]] in his life. He was presumed to be a good father to his many children, understanding their taste for human flesh and allowing them to attack and eat anyone they wanted when they were hungry. Hagrid was the only human that Aragog stopped his sons and daughters from attacking.  One such case of this was when Ron Weasley and Harry Potter found Aragog, however, this was more than likely an act of parental care as opposed to anger or hatred as Ron comes to think. However, the two managed to escape by sheer luck, as the Weasleys' enchanted [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]] emerged to extract them from the danger.<ref name="COS15"/>

{{Quote|We do not speak of it! We do not name it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.|Aragog's fear of Basilisks|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
Aragog, like all spiders, feared [[Basilisk]]s, (though the personality of the basilisk lurking in Hogwarts was most likely a contributing factor), and would not speak of one, not even to Hagrid himself, even though he had asked him about the creature many times. The way that Aragog would not speak their name or of them was similar to the way that [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] (amongst other [[creature]]s like [[House-elf|house-elves]] and [[goblin]]s) would not speak Voldemort's name, or discuss him even obliquely any more than was absolutely necessary, which was appropriate since he himself commanded the creature in his youth.<ref name="COS15"/>

==Etymology==
*Aragog comes from the words "Ara" which comes from "arachnid", which is the class [[spider]]s belong to. "Gog" and "Magog" are biblical names.
*Possibly derived from the Greek word "agog", meaning "leader", from which the modern English "demagogue" is an iteration.

*In {{COS|FA}}, Aragog was voiced by [[Julian Glover]]. The film also changed his dwelling in the castle from a cupboard to a treasure chest-like box.
*It is possible that Aragog could have been inspired by [[w:c:lotr:Shelob|Shelob]], another giant spider, from ''{{w|The Two Towers|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers}}''.
*A [[LEGO Harry Potter|LEGO]] version of Aragog was released, entitled ''4727 Aragog in the Dark Forest.'' A second was released in 2010 in which he appeared, named ''4738 Hagrid's Hut''.[http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=4727 LEGO Product page for ''4727 Aragog in the Dark Forest'']
*In the {{WWHP}}, visitors can purchase a plush version of Aragog.
*In {{COS|FA}}, Aragog was a massive animatronic creature. [[Rupert Grint]], the actor who plays Ron Weasley, is afraid of spiders just as much as his character is, and said the scenes with Aragog were easily the scariest scenes to film.<ref name="vogue">[https://www.vogue.fr/fashion-culture/article/3-things-you-didnt-know-about-harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets 3 things you didn't know about Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets] - Vogue, 22 April 2020</ref>
*An error in the accusation against Hagrid for having unleashed the monster from the Chamber of Secrets is that an Acromantula cannot petrify or kill with its stare, unlike a Basilisk.
*In {{HPFJ}}, Aragog can be seen in the [[Forbidden Forest]] scene. When the riders encounter Aragog, he squirts fake [[Acromantula venom|venom]], which is actually water. Aragog is a giant prop for the ride, and he doesn't seem to do anything.
*According to {{HPV|CR}}, Aragog "was such a beloved character that the design crew wore black armbands while the spider's final scene (Aragog's funeral) was filmed."
*The animatronic puppet of Aragog can be found on display at {{MHP}} studio tour in Leavesden.
*In 2017, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of "Harry Potter" franchise, arachnologists Anton A. Nadolny and Alireza Zamani named a new species of Iranian wolf spiders (Lycosidae) after Aragog, as ''Lycosa aragogi''. The single specimen was collected on April 26, 2016, almost 19 years to the day after Aragog died (April 20, 1997 in the world of the book), according to the "Harry Potter" series, by J.K. Rowling.<ref name="wolf spider">[https://www.livescience.com/59729-wolf-spider-honors-harry-potter-aragog.html / Wolf Spider honours Harry Potter's Aragog]</ref>
