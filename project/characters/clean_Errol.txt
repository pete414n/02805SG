'''Errol''' was one of the [[Weasley family]]'s [[owl]]s. or ''Strix nebulosa''.

He was "ancient" by 1992, and his poor eyesight caused him to hit objects in flight. According to [[Harry Potter]], he resembled a moulting feather duster.


Errol had been with the [[Weasley family]] since at least [[1984]], before [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] started at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]]. During a game of truth-or-dare with friends sometime during in [[1989–1990 school year|1989–1990]], [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] revealed that, in his youth, Charlie used to try and turn the family pets into dragons. Since this was before he knew any spells, he settled on sticking paper wings on [[Peter Pettigrew#Scabbers|Scabbers]] using [[Spellotape]] and on making Errol fly around with a dragon mask, and then following them around while jotting down his "observations of dragon behaviour".


When Ron Weasley didn't hear from Harry Potter all summer, he initially thought it was Errol's fault because it wouldn't be the first time he collapsed on delivery. Errol was absolved when Ron learned that [[Dobby]] had deliberately prevented Harry from receiving post.

Errol later delivered [[Hermione Granger's letter to Ronald Weasley and Harry Potter|Hermione Granger's letter]] to Ron and Harry. [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] advised Ron to use another owl next time because another delivery might finish Errol off. He also delivered [[Molly Weasley's Howler to Ronald Weasley|Molly Weasley's Howler]] to Ron after he and Harry stole Arthur Weasley's flying [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]] and drove it to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].

 and a Hogwarts owl]]
On [[31 July]] [[1993]], on Ron's behalf, Errol delivered Harry's [[Sneakoscope|first birthday present]], a [[Ronald Weasley's letter to Harry Potter (1993)|letter]], and the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' [[MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE|article]] about the Weasleys winning the [[Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw|Grand Prize Galleon Draw]] before his [[third year]] at Hogwarts. He lost consciousness during the journey, and he had to be carried into [[4 Privet Drive]] by Harry's owl [[Hedwig]] and a [[Unidentified Hogwarts owl|Hogwarts owl]]. Later that day, Harry sent Hedwig to stay at [[the Burrow]] with Errol while [[Marjorie Dursley|Marge Dursley]] visited Privet Drive.

When she heard that Harry was expected to live on an extreme diet in the summer of 1994, Mrs Weasley sent Errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted pasties. This was too much for Errol, whom Harry described as "elderly and feeble," and he needed five full days to recover. Errol and [[Percy Weasley]]'s owl [[Hermes]] had become annoyed by Ron's excitable owl [[Pigwidgeon]], which forced Ron to keep him in his own room.

Errol was last mentioned in [[August]] [[1994]], and subsequent letters from [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]] were delivered by an unidentified [[barn owl]] and by [[Fawkes]]. Considering Errol's advanced age, it is likely that he had passed away after that time, although this is unconfirmed.


In [[April]] [[2020]], Errol appeared as a [[Foundable]] during another surge of the [[Calamity]]. Volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] were able to return him to his original time.


Errol is a village in [[Scotland]], near Perth, which may have served as inspiration for the name of the Weasley family owl.

It is also the name of a dragon in an early Terry Pratchett novel that flies into windows and has the tendency to explode.

It is also possible that his name refers to "error" (as the two words are similar), because of the bird's age and known characteristics.



*Errol appears in , as he bumps into the kitchen window at [[The Burrow]]. Later in the film, he lands in a bowl of crisps in the [[Great Hall]] in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] when delivering Ron a [[Howler]] from his [[Molly Weasley|mom]]. It is later mentioned that he was used by Ron to deliver [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s release papers. Due to the fact that Errol got lost, Hagrid's release from [[Azkaban|prison]] was delayed.
*When [[J. K. Rowling]] first dreamt up Errol, she had in her mind a picture she had seen of "''a very comical, large, fluffy, grey, bewildered-looking bird whose breed I had never known''". When she first visited the aviary at [[Wikipedia:Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Studios]], when ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' was being filmed, she saw a big line of great grey owls that were "''an exact replica''" of what she had in mind.
