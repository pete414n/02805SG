'''Professor Dilys Derwent''' (d. [[1768]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who worked as a [[Healer]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] and was a celebrated [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Her [[portrait]] hangs not only in the [[Headmaster's office|Headmaster's Office]] along with the [[Headmaster portraits|portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses]], but also in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]' main admitting area.



Derwent started working at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] in [[1722]].

Derwent left the job in [[1741]] and became the [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] that same year. She proved very popular among students and teachers, gaining her the status of one of the "most celebrated [[Headmaster|Heads]]" among Dumbledore and Everard. She died in the post in 1768.



When [[Arthur Weasley]] was [[Attack on Arthur Weasley|attacked]] by Voldemort's [[snake]] [[Nagini]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]] in late [[1995]], [[Albus Dumbledore]], then-[[Headmaster]], asked Derwent to go to her portrait at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]'s main admitting area in order to keep Dumbledore apprised on Mr Weasley's condition.

When [[Harry Potter]] went to the [[Headmaster's office]], shortly after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s defeat and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Dilys Derwent joined the ovation made by the previous Hogwarts Headmasters, sobbing unashamedly.


*'''[[Healing magic]]''': As a professional [[Healer]] who worked at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], Derwent would have been very accomplished and talented in the field of medical magic.
*'''Leadership skills''': As a former [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of Hogwarts school, Derwent was presumably a very capable headmistress and school leader, given her widespread popularity amongst both staff and students.


The name "Dilys" means "genuine" in Welsh. Derwent may be from the name of an English lake in Cumbria, in the Lake District called "Derwent Water".
