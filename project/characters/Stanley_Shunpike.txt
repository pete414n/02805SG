'''Stanley "Stan" Shunpike''' (born between [[15 September]] [[1974]] and [[13 September]] [[1975]]) 

On [[14 September]] [[1996]], he was arrested and sent to [[Azkaban]] for being a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] when he was overheard claiming to have inside information about the organisation, although in all likelihood, he was only fooling around. In [[1997]], he broke free from prison and joined the Death Eaters under the [[Imperius Curse]]. 

His fate after the war is unknown; he most likely awoke from the curse following [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s ultimate defeat, like all the other Imperiused victims, and returned to his job.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Stanley was born between [[15 September]] [[1974]] and [[13 September]] [[1975]], and possibly grew up in inner [[London]], as he had a strong [[Wikipedia:Cockney|Cockney]] accent. It is unknown if he ever attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], but if so, he would have attended from [[1986]] to [[1993]], unless he was born in early September.

===Conductor of the Knight Bus===
{{Quote|Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand, step on board, and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve— What were you doin’ down there?|Stan Shunpike greeting Harry Potter in 1993|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:300px-Stan Shunpike-1-.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Stan Shunpike in the [[Knight Bus]]]]
Stan was a skilled motorist, but not a man of high intelligence. As such, Stan failed to recognise [[Harry Potter]] who had just fled from [[4 Privet Drive]] and instead believed his alias of [[Neville Longbottom]].

When talking to Harry and others on the Knight Bus he showed his love of gossip and of having inside information. He was shocked when Harry nonchalantly spoke the name "[[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]", and even when later meeting up with [[Cornelius Fudge]], who confirmed Harry's true identity, Stan continued to refer Harry as "Neville" for the rest of that trip.

Stan attended the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]], and after the match, Stan and several others were witnessed by Harry and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] trying to chat up a group of [[Veela]], with Stan making the outrageous and false comment of him being "''about to be made the youngest [[Minister for Magic]] ever''", in an effort to impress them.

===Second Wizarding War===

====Transporting the Order of the Phoenix====
{{Quote|You keepin' well, then, 'Arry? I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer, but it weren’t never nuffink very nice. ... I said to Ern, I said, ' 'e didn't seem like a nutter when we met 'im, just goes to show, dunnit?'|Stan's well-meaning recklessness|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Stan met [[Harry Potter|Harry]] once again when he, along with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and his siblings were being transported by the [[Knight Bus]] back to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[January]] [[1996]]. Stan, this time, realised who Harry was, though made the mistake of blurting out his name to his friend, the driver, [[Ernest Prang|Ernie Prang]]. Harry's primary bodyguard; the expertly-disguised [[Auror]] [[Nymphadora Tonks]], threatened to "[[curse]] Stan into oblivion" if he did it again, as they were concerned for Harry's security.

====Imprisonment in Azkaban====
{{Quote|Stanley Shunpike, conductor of the popular Wizarding conveyance the [[Knight Bus]], has been arrested on suspicion of [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] activity. Mr Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his [[Stanley Shunpike's home|Clapham home]]....|Excerpt from a ''[[Daily Prophet]] ''article about Stan Shunpike's arrest|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Stan, true to his vain nature, tried to impress his friends at a local pub by making the statement that he had inside knowledge of the [[Death Eaters]]' plans. The [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], now [[Minister for Magic|led]] by [[Rufus Scrimgeour]], found out and raided his [[Stanley Shunpike's home|home]] in [[Clapham]], taking him into custody on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Stan was then sent to [[Azkaban]] prison. Stan continued his incarceration throughout 1996, and was one of the reasons that Harry refused to cooperate with Scrimgeour, or serve as the Ministry's "poster child", as Harry refused to believe that Stan could be a Death Eater. Indeed, the interrogation with Stan revealed that he had absolutely no link with the Death Eaters, but the Ministry kept him in order to put up a façade of progress.

====Escape from Azkaban====
In [[1997]], Azkaban experienced a [[Azkaban_escapes#1997|breakout]] at the hands of Death Eaters. Although Stan was no Death Eater, he was still freed from his cell (perhaps because he was close to the others, or the Death Eaters might have simply wanted to show the Ministry they had no power in Azkaban). Either way, Stan joined the Death Eaters' ranks, albeit under the [[Imperius Curse]].

===== Battle of the Seven Potters =====
{{Quote|I saw Stan Shunpike.... You know, the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of — well, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!|Harry Potter discussing Stan after the Battle of the Seven Potters|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Stan took part in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], during which he and nearly thirty other Death Eaters flew into battle against members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] who were trying to transport Harry Potter to safety. Stan and several others, unknowingly, tracked down the real Harry (who had been given decoys to lure pursuers away). 

In combat, Harry fired a spell that knocked Stan's Death Eater mask off, exposing his "''blank eyes''" (a tell-tale sign of Imperius control), and, because a [[Stunning Spell]] while over a hundred feet in the air would result in Stan falling to his [[death]], Harry elected to shoot a [[Disarming Charm]], blowing Stan's wand out of his hand, though Stan's comrades recognised this as Harry's "signature move" and broke off their attack, instead summoning [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] himself into the fray.

Later that year, [[Ronald Weasley]] used Stan's identity to trick a gang of [[Snatchers]] he encountered somewhere in [[England]] to avoid them arresting him as a [[Muggle-born]], which succeeded. Ron later used his identity again to fool [[Scabior]]'s gang of Snatchers in [[March]] [[1998]], which unlike previously, was unsuccessful, as Scabior was not fooled as he knew Shunpike personally.

It is unknown what Shunpike proceeded to do, although shortly before the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]], Scabior mentioned that Shunpike "put a bit of work our way". It is also unknown if he participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

===Later life===
Following the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], it was reported that hundreds of people under the control of the Imperius curse were freed. If Stan survived to this point, he most likely returned to his job on the Knight Bus. However, his fate is currently unknown.

==Physical description==
He was described as being "''eighteen or nineteen at most''" in [[1993|1993,]] and as having "''large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples''". He wore a purple uniform as to go with the colour of the [[Knight Bus]]. He had a fairly slovenly appearance and was somewhat more unkempt appearance than most wizards (although not to the extent of the likes of [[Morfin Gaunt]]).

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|I'm about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic, I am.|Shunpike trying to impress a group of [[Veela]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
In spite of being a friendly and well-meaning wizard, Stan Shunpike was not very bright, as he failed to recognise the child celebrity [[Harry Potter]]. But then again it might have simply been that he did not get time to properly examine Harry's scar, as Harry hid it immediately after Stan showed interest, which would have likely confirmed Harry's true identity. He loved gossip and having inside information, a trait that later landed him in [[Azkaban]]. Like most wizards, he was openly disturbed when wizards spoke the name "[[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]".

Stan was very vain, a trait akin to [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], although less pronounced. Lockhart easily made women and girls swoon over him, whereas Stan had often resorted to boasting when in the presence of attractive young women in order to try and impress them. His slovenly appearance suggested that he resorted to toughness to bolster his perceived credibility with girls. The two most infamous examples of his vanity is his trying to chat up [[Veela]] that he would become the [[Minister for Magic]], and falsely boasting in a pub that he knew of the [[Death Eaters]]' secret plans, the latter which got him into huge trouble when the corrupt Ministry tried to make it appear as they were making progress, even at Stan's expense.

{{Quote|Them! Don’ listen properly, do they? Don’ look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don’.|Stan's mockery of Muggles|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
He seemed to disdain [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] to some degree, as when Harry asked him whether the Muggles were able to see and hear the [[Knight Bus]], Stan contemptuously remarked that Muggles did not listen or see properly, not to mention they never noticed anything [[magic]]al, in his eyes.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Stan was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]. This is a highly advanced form of [[magic]].

==Etymology==
The name Stanley also belonged to one of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s grandfathers, with the other one being named Ernie, which was the name given to the driver of the [[Knight Bus]], [[Ernest Prang|Ernie Prang]]. The name {{Wplink|Shunpike}} may refer to "shunning a pike", i.e. swerving onto to a highway exit in order to avoid a toll booth on the turnpike.

*Stan Shunpike was played by [[Lee Ingleby]] in {{POA|FA}}. His character was cut from the remainder of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] in which he would have appeared. He was originally rumoured to be returning to the role in [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game)|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1'']]'', ''but that rumour didn't turn out to be true.
*Despite being described in the books as looking like he was in his late teens, with a pimply face, Stan was played by nearly 30 year old Ingleby in {{POA|FA}}.
*Since Stan was omitted from the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{POA}}, his role when he talked to Harry about [[Sirius Black]] was replaced with Ron.
*During the events in {{DH}}, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] pretended to be Stan Shunpike twice. The first time when he was caught by a couple of [[Snatchers]] and later to [[Werewolf]], [[Fenrir Greyback]]. Greyback knew that Ron was not Stan.
*Stanley was named after [[J. K. Rowling]]'s grandfather, Stanley Volant.
*In the 2004 {{LEGO}} set 4755 [[Knight Bus]], Stan replaces [[Ernest Prang]] as the driver of the [[Knight Bus]].
