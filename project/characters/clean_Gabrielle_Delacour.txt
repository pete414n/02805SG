'''Gabrielle Delacour''' was a [[Half-Veela|quarter-Veela]] [[France|French]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the daughter of [[Delacour sisters' father|Monsieur Delacour]] and [[Apolline Delacour]]. She had one older sister, [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]. Through Fleur, Gabrielle was related to the [[Weasley family]]. She was saved in the Second Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] by [[Harry Potter]], whom her sister became good friends with. Through Fleur, she was the aunt of [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]] and [[Louis Weasley]].



Gabrielle was born between [[31 July]] [[1985]] and [[30 July]] [[1986]] to a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], [[Delacour sisters' father|Monsieur Delacour]], and a [[half-Veela]] witch, [[Apolline Delacour]], in [[France]]. Her [[Apolline Delacour's mother|grandmother]] was a full [[Veela]], who married a wizard and whose [[Veela hair|hair]] was the core of her older sister Fleur's wand. She and her sister [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] were one-quarter [[Veela]] through their mother's side of the family.




On [[31 October]] [[1994]], Gabrielle's older sister, Fleur was chosen as [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]]'s champion in the [[Triwizard Tournament]], which was understandably considered to be a great honour. Because eight-year-old Gabrielle was treasured by Fleur above anything else she was taken into the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]] under the influence of a [[bewitched sleep|magical spell]] during the Second Task. 

Fleur failed to reach her due to a [[grindylow]] attack and the negative effects of being underwater. [[Harry Potter]], the fourth champion of the tournament, had already found the hostages and held off a hoard of [[Merpeople]]. Harry then brought Gabrielle to the surface of the lake, along with his own hostage and best friend [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].


From that time on, both Fleur and Gabrielle treated Harry and Ron with a great deal of kindness. Gabrielle waved at Harry on the day of the Third Task, when visiting her sister along with her parents. She then returned to France with her family after the tournament ended.




Gabrielle was chosen as a bridesmaid for her older sister's [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] to [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] at the [[the Burrow|Burrow]] in the summer of [[1997]], when she was eleven years old. When the [[Delacour family|Delacours]] first arrived Gabrielle shot a "glowing look" at Harry. She then batted her eyelashes, possibly indicating that she had a crush on her former saviour. [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], Fleur's other bridesmaid, cleared her throat loudly at this, as she was evidently still somewhat possessive of Harry. 

Gabrielle then assisted Fleur with wedding preparations, speaking rapidly in French as she went. She participated in the ceremony wearing [[Gabrielle_Delacour's_bridesmaid_dress|a golden dress]] and looking "''even prettier than [[Veela|usual]]''".

Gabrielle became the sister-in-law of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and the aunt of [[Victoire Weasley]], [[Dominique Weasley]], and [[Louis Weasley]] due to the wedding. She also became a relative by marriage of the famous [[Harry Potter]], through his marriage to [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]].


It isn't known what Gabrielle did after the war, but it is likely she attended Beauxbatons Academy of Magic like her sister.


Gabrielle was described as being her older sister, [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]], in miniature, and therefore breathtakingly beautiful: she had waist-length, silvery-blonde hair, and a smile described as "dazzling".


Much like her other family members, Gabrielle appeared to be a gracious and pleasant girl, as she was immensely grateful towards Harry Potter for having honourably saved her in the Second Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. She may have even developed a crush on Harry afterwards, as at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of her sister and brother-in-law, she was noted to have given Harry a "glowing look" and batted her eyelashes, but she might have just been very appreciative of him instead.


* is the French feminine form of the Hebrew name ''Gabriel'', meaning "man of god". In the bible, Gabriel is the name of a prominent angel.
*"Delacour" is formed by the three French words "de", "la" and "cour" which directly translates to "of the court".



*In , Gabrielle, at 8 years old, is already attending [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] based on her attire. This means that she is 11 years-old at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour]], but looks much older. Alternately, it is possible Gabrielle is older in the films than in the books, in the same way that [[Romilda Vane]] is two years older in film continuity.
*Gabrielle is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actress [[Angelica Mandy]] in  and the .
*In the film adaptation of , she says goodbye to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and gives him a kiss on the cheek. In the novel, she does not say goodbye to Ron.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|film adaptation]], she is seen doing back flips down the aisle. We later see her sitting next to her sister looking at the cup.
*In , it is confirmed that Gabrielle already has a wand at age eight and that she can perform [[magic]] of the level of a [[fourth year]] Hogwarts student. This seems to support the theory that Beauxbatons students start at a younger age than Hogwarts students. However, her ability to work quite advanced magic in such game might be just down to game-play reasons, as her [[spell]]-casting abilities are no different from any accomplished wizard character in the game.
