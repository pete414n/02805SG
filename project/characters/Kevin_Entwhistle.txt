==Etymology==
*Anglicised form of the Irish name Caoimhín, derived from the older Irish Cóemgein, composed of the Old Irish elements cóem "kind, gentle, handsome" and gein "birth". Saint Caoimhín established a monastery in Glendalough, Ireland in the 6th century and is the patron saint of Dublin.
*''Entwhistle'' could be a form of ''Entwistle'' which is an English habitual name from the village of Entwisle in Lancashire, named from Old English henna ‘(water) hen’ or ened ‘duck’ + twisla ‘tongue of land in a river fork’[https://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=entwistle].
==Behind the scenes==
*Kevin Entwhistle is listed as a [[Ravenclaw]] on the list of students in a page of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s notes shown on {{HPM}}. However, as two listed Hufflepuffs ([[Anthony Goldstein]] and [[Michael Corner]]) had their houses changed to Ravenclaw in the novels as published, two of those listed as Ravenclaws must have been changed to Hufflepuff. Entwhistle may be one of those whose house was changed.
**He is also listed as a [[Muggle-born]].
