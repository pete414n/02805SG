The '''Fat Lady''' was a [[portrait]] who guarded the entrance to [[Gryffindor Tower]] at [[Hogwarts Castle]]. She asked for a [[password]] before letting anyone in, then swung her picture backward so that students could enter through a portrait hole.



Next to nothing is known about the Fat Lady's early life or what her name was when she was alive. She presumably was educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] house.

It is unknown when or how she died, but it was by some time in the 1890s at the very latest (since her portrait already guarded the entrance to [[Gryffindor Tower]] by then).



After the Fat Lady died, a painting depicting her was hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]], guarding the [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor Common Room]]. It is also unknown who or what, if anything, guarded the common room before her. The Fat Lady was a dutiful guardian to the Gryffindor Tower, only granting entrance to those who produce the correct password. She had, however, been known for reprimanding students when they returned late, annoyed that they woke her up from her sleep. She had been known to move about occasionally and had a friend, [[Violet]], who visited her, especially during such holidays as Christmas break. The two drank together frequently, once consuming several vats of wine that were in a picture of some drunk monks.

[[1960s]]
When [[Molly Weasley|Molly Prewett]] was a student, she returned to Gryffindor Tower at four o'clock in the morning after taking a late night stroll with her then boyfriend (now husband), [[Arthur Weasley]], and they both got a telling-off from the Fat Lady.

[[1975]]
After the end of their friendship, Severus Snape remained outside the Gryffindor Common Room until Lily came out to talk to him.

[[1991–1992 school year]]
 
In [[1991]], the Fat Lady allowed [[first year]] Gryffindors into Gryffindor tower with the correct password. When [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley]] had left the dormitory late one night to [[Duelling|duel]] [[Draco Malfoy]] at the third floor, she went off for a nightime visit, therefore meaning they, [[Hermione Granger]] (who had tried to stop them leaving) and [[Neville Longbottom]] (who had forgotten the password), could not enter, resulting in all four of them heading down to the third floor. By the time she had returned to her portrait and the four of them had returned back to the dormitory, she questioned them on where they had been. Later in December [[1991]], when Harry Potter left the dormitory at night under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisbility Cloak]], she questioned who was there when Harry came through her portrait, as she could not see him due to him being fully [[Invisibility|invisible]].

[[1992–1993 school year]]
At the start of the school year when [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley]] arrived late to the castle, due to missing the [[Hogwarts Express]] and being forced to drive the [[Flying Ford Anglia]] to school (and crashing it into the [[Whomping Willow]]), the two initially did not know the password to enter. However, their friend [[Hermione Granger]] soon arrived to tell them the password.

[[1993–1994 school year]]


On [[Hallowe'en]] [[1993]], the Fat Lady's portrait was [[Sirius Black's break-in of Hogwarts Castle (1993)|ruined]] by [[Sirius Black]] and pulled off the wall. She was temporarily replaced by [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]] because nobody else wanted the job. After Sir Cadogan was fired when Sirius Black used the list of passwords he obtained by getting Hermione's cat, [[Crookshanks]], to steal it from [[Neville Longbottom]] to enter the Gryffindor tower to (unseccessfully) murder Ron's pet rat, [[Scabbers]] and returned to the seventh floor, the Fat Lady's portrait was restored by [[Argus Filch]] at this time. She agreed to return to her original location and duties in exchange for protection. This caused several [[security troll]]s to be hired to patrol the hallways to prevent further vandalism and fight off any intruders.

[[1994–1995 school year]]

In [[1994]], when [[Harry Potter]] had been chosen as the fourth [[Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard]] champion, the Fat Lady was informed of this by her friend and fellow portrait [[Violet]]. She seemed very eager to meet Harry when he went back to the common room, even bringing her friends from portraits with her.

When Harry Potter and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] were called by [[Hermione Granger]] to go to the [[Hogwarts kitchens|kitchen]], the Fat Lady was annoyed that she had to open the door just after they planned to not use it. Later that year, after the [[Yule Ball]] ended, the Fat Lady and Violet were both drunk, and Harry Potter had some trouble getting her to open the door. Again, when Harry tried to enter the tower, the Fat Lady was asleep and he had to yell the password to wake her up, much to her irritation.

[[1995–1996 school year]]

At the start of the school year, the Fat Lady initially refused to allow Harry to enter as he did not know the password, but [[Neville Longbottom]] arrived and gave the correct password (''[[Mimbulus mimbletonia]]'') and she allowed them entry. When Harry, Ron and Hermione were discussing [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s [[Black Quill|draconian]] detentions for Harry outside the common room, the Fat Lady was annoyed at them for waking her up with their talking. At the end of the school year, when Harry Potter sprinted out of the common room, she called upon him not to miss the [[End-of-Term Feast]].

[[1996–1997 school year]]

She and her friend Violet had overindulged on an entire vat of five-hundred year old [[wine]] over [[Christmas]] [[1996]], meaning she was rather hungover and pale looking when Harry and Ron returned to Hogwarts in the castle a few days after the New Year in [[1997]].

Once, when Harry Potter returned late and woke her up, she refused to let him in, claiming that the password changed overnight. When Harry ran off to see Dumbledore regarding Slughorn's memory, she called after him and admitted that she was just kidding, though Harry proceeded to Dumbledore's office anyway.

Later that year, when Dumbledore was seemingly [[Killing Curse|murdered]] by [[Severus Snape]], the Fat Lady was in sorrow and she allowed Harry to enter the Tower without the password, while she cried. She presumably continued to carry out her same role after the [[Second Wizarding War|war]].

The Fat Lady was, as suggested by her nickname, a "very fat woman" who was painted wearing a pink silk dress. which is either a mistake or evidence that the Fat Lady was capable of changing her clothes. 

She looked "rather paler than usual" while suffering the effects of a hangover, which might suggest that she had a pale complexion under normal circumstances.



The Fat Lady was well known during her life for her indulgence in good food and drink, as well as a passion for "tip-top security," traits that her portrait would later possess.

As the guardian of the [[Gryffindor Tower]]'s entrance, she was very dutiful, refusing entry to students who did not know the correct password. She was often irritated by those who would return late, waking her from her sleep. At such times, she would not hesitate to even lie to such students that the password has changed overnight, making them believe they have to sleep outside for the night.

Despite her dutiful and strict nature, she did have a sensitive side. After [[Sirius Black]] slashed her portrait, the Fat Lady was too scared to continue her duties until [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] provided her corridor with several [[Security troll]]s. After Dumbledore's death, she was so distraught that she allowed [[Harry Potter]] entry without the password and she began to cry.





*In , the Fat Lady is played by the late [[Elizabeth Spriggs]]. She is shown with black hair and a pink silk dress and she doesn't seem to have much personality. Oddly, this version of her is not particularly fat. Her portrait is located at the end of a corridor somewhere in the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]], but its location is never specified.
**The Fat Lady as portrayed by Spriggs moves only when approached by a student and very little at that. She also asks for the password, ensuring more effective concealment of the common room. In the first film, given the Fat Lady's dress and background, she seems to have lived in the sixteenth century Europe.
**The Spriggs version of the Fat Lady's portrait is also used in the video game adaptations of ''Philosopher's Stone'' and ''Chamber of Secrets''.
*In , she is played by [[Dawn French]], who portrays the character with a more humorous side, such as giving her a bad singing voice (possibly from the saying "the fat lady sings"). This iteration of her is larger than the previous one. She is much louder and more flamboyant and would be obvious to any passing members of other houses, who would also be able to hear Gryffindor students as they gave her the password, which this version of the portrait is reluctant to listen to. By this time, her portrait has been moved to the [[Hogwarts Castle|seventh floor]] of the [[Marble Staircase Tower|Grand Staircase Tower]]. The portrait is shown to swing backwards rather than forwards in this film as well. In the third film, given the Fat Lady's dress and background, she seems to have lived during the . When the Gryffindor students aren't impressed with her singing, she mutters "Plebs" as they pass her. She also wears a white dress instead of a pink one.
**The reason why the location of the Fat Lady's portrait was changed in the third film was because the filmmakers opted not to return to Gloucester Cathedral, where the scenes for the Fat Lady in the first film were shot.
*In , it is suggested that the Fat Lady's portrait may actually be a hidden passageway or shortcut. This is because the Gryffindor Boys' Dormitory is shown to be located in a small tower at the corner of the [[The Quad|Paved Courtyard]] close to the [[Clock Tower]] and it is presumed the Fat Lady's portrait remains located in the [[Grand Staircase]].
*In the American versions of the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|''Chamber of Secrets'' video game]], she is instead named '''The Pink Lady'''.
*In the video game versions of the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|fifth]] and [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|sixth]] films, characters do not give the Fat Lady a password, as she simply opens to admit them upon recognising them.
*It can also be noted that although the location of the portrait changes in the films, the size and shape of the actual [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor Common Room]] remains the same.
*The Fat Lady is a playable character in , in which she, despite being opaque and not floating like ghosts, only has [[ghost]]ly abilities (like scaring other characters).
*In , the entrance to the Gryffindor Common Room appears to be a normal door, though it is possible that it leads to the Fat Lady's corridor.
