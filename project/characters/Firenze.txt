{{Quote|[[Centaur]]s are not the servants or playthings of [[human]]s.|Firenze regarding centaur and human relations|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Professor Firenze''' was a [[centaur]], part of the [[Forbidden Forest Centaur colony]], and a [[Divination]] teacher at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1996]]-[[1998]].

Before sometime in March 1996, he lived with the colony in the [[Forbidden Forest]], on the borders of Hogwarts in [[Scotland]]. In 1992, Firenze saved [[Harry Potter]] in the forest from [[Quirinus Quirrell]], who was possessed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], frightening Quirrell away and carrying Harry on his back to safety. Despite his heroics, his herd saw this as a dishonourable act, as they considered themselves too great to be ridden by humans.

About four years later, in March 1996, [[Albus Dumbledore]], [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], hired him to teach Divination in [[Sybill Trelawney]]'s stead, after she was sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]]. But once again, the other centaurs saw this as servitude, and his colony attacked and banished him. They would have killed him were it not for the intervention of [[Rubeus Hagrid]].

After Dumbledore was reinstated as headmaster, Trelawney was returned to her classroom. However, since Firenze was still estranged with his colony, Dumbledore allowed them both to continue teaching, though Trelawney was uncomfortable with sharing her classes with a centaur.

When Firenze was injured fighting in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], he returned to his colony later when the other centaurs had come to the opinion that his pro-human leanings were not so shameful. Despite this, he  continued to share the post of Divination professor at Hogwarts with [[Sybill Trelawney]].<ref name="Of Horse And Man">{{WU}} - "An overnight seminar is hosted in the [[Forbidden Forest]] by Firenze, [[centaur]] and [[Divination]] teacher at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]."</ref>

==Biography==
===Life with his herd===
{{Quote|This is where I leave you. You are safe now. Good luck, Harry Potter. The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.|Firenze bids Harry Potter goodbye after seeing him to safety|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Firenze was, presumably, born to the centaur colony in the Forbidden Forest, and lived part of his life there.<ref name="PS15" /> He was gifted in [[Divination]] and taught fellow centaur [[Torvus]] about it.<ref name="HM6ch4">{{HM|6|4}}</ref>

[[File:Firenze in the Forbidden Forest HM625.png|250px|thumb|right|Firenze in the Forbidden Forest]]
In the [[1989–1990 school year]], Firenze was chosen as the centaur who decided whether [[Jacob's sibling]] was allowed to visit the [[Centaur Camp]] based on the three gifts offered by them. Firenze decided the student could stay, and helped them figure out what [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]]'s prophecy meant.<ref name="HM6ch4"/> Jacob's sibling later spoke to [[Torvus]] and Firenze in the [[Centaur Camp]] to discuss Trelawney's prophecy and how Jacob's sibling would face the final [[Buried Vault|Cursed Vault]]. Firenze told them that his prediction implied they would face a powerful decision, a powerful adversary and another loss, but that he could not be entirely certain his prediction was correct.<ref name="HM625">{{HM|6|25}}</ref>

On the night of 26 May 1992, Hagrid took Harry, [[Hermione Granger]], [[Neville Longbottom]], and [[Draco Malfoy]] to their detention in the forest. Their task was to find out why [[unicorn]]s were turning up mauled and dead.<ref name="PS15"/>[[File:Firenze talking to Harry.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Firenze telling [[Harry Potter|Harry]] about the unicorn in the [[Forbidden Forest]]]]
Harry and Draco later discovered a dead unicorn and a hooded figure ([[Quirinus Quirrell]] in disguise) drinking its [[Unicorn blood|blood]]. As Draco ran away, horrified, the hooded Quirrell turned to face Harry. The pain on his [[Harry Potter's scars#The lightning-bolt scar|scar]] made him fall to his knees, but Firenze, coming across the scene, galloped forwards and charged at Quirrell, scaring him away.<ref name="PS15" /> Harry found out afterwards, it was [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] who, drinking the unicorns' blood while sharing Quirrell's body, tried to remain alive long enough so that he could drink the [[Elixir of Life]] and return to both his body and full strength.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>[[File:Harry Potter and Firenze in the Forbidden Forest.jpg|250px|thumb|Firenze meets Harry Potter after saving him from Quirrell and Voldemort|alt=]]Realising how dangerous it would be to let Harry stay in the Forest, he let him on his back so that he could take him to safety. [[Bane]] and [[Ronan]], two other centaurs from the colony, arrived there and, while Ronan said he was sure Firenze thought he had been acting for the best, Bane started yelling at him because he regarded it as a despicable action, because a centaur is not for humans to ride. Firenze was angered and, leaving both centaurs behind, carried Harry on his back to safety where he was reunited with Hermione, Neville, Draco and Hagrid.<ref name="PS15" />

===Life as Hogwarts professor===
====1995-1996 school year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Parvati Patil|Professor Trelawney did astrology with us! Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that, and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now — that means people need to be extra careful when handling hot things— |Firenze|That is human nonsense. Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents, these are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe, and are unaffected by planetary movements.|Firenze teaching his first Divination lesson|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Firenze PM.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Firenze talking with [[Harry Potter]] and Ron Weasley after his first Divination lesson|alt=]]
In March 1996, Dumbledore hired Firenze as the [[Divination (class)|Divination]] teacher when Dolores Umbridge (then-[[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor of Hogwarts]]) sacked Sybill Trelawney.<ref name="OP26" />

This resulted in Firenze being cast out of his colony, since agreeing to work for a human was considered a betrayal of their kind. His colony had even attacked him, and might have killed him if not for the intervention of Hagrid.<ref name="OOTP30">{{OOTP|B|30}}</ref>

Dumbledore transformed the classroom into a forest-type state for Firenze, and students were requested to lie back and look at the stars on the small enchanted ceiling. [[Lavender Brown]] and [[Parvati Patil]] found him very appealing and looked forward to his lessons, even though they liked Professor Trelawney as well.<ref name="OP27">{{OOTP|B|27}}</ref>

====1996-1997 school year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Sybill Trelawney|Good evening, my dear. I haven't seen you in my classes lately...|Luna Lovegood|No, I've got Firenze this year.|Oh, of course. Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no... we share classes... It’s an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know...|Discussion of Firenze at the Slug Club Christmas party|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
With the departure of the headmistress [[Dolores Umbridge]] from Hogwarts at the end of the school year, Professor Trelawney was reinstated by Dumbledore to her post of Divination Professor. Firenze, however, could not return to his still resentful colony, so Dumbledore let him continue teaching Divination alongside Trelawney.<ref name="HBP20">{{HBP|B|20}}</ref>

Firenze taught the fifth-year [[Ravenclaw]]s,<ref name="HBP15" /> though sharing classes with him caused Trelawney much consternation, as she considered it an insult to be sharing classes with a "horse".<ref name="HBP15" /> In turn, Firenze did not seem to think much of Trelawney, seeming to find her attempts at [[Cartomancy]] "almost comical."<ref name="HBP25" />

[[File:Funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|Firenze atttended the funeral of Albus Dumbledore|alt=]]
After Dumbledore's death at the hands of [[Severus Snape]] atop the [[Astronomy Tower]] on the evening of 30 June 1997, Firenze attended Dumbledore's funeral. He stood "like a sentinel" by the shores of the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]], paying his respects to the wizard who had welcomed him and given him a job and a home. Dolores Umbridge was startled by his appearance at the funeral, considering her previous experience with Centaurs.<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>

====1997-1998 school year and Battle of Hogwarts====
{{Quote|Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand.|Description of his injury during the battle|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Firenze continued teaching at Hogwarts during Snape's tenure as Headmaster, and the [[Death Eaters]]' control over Wizarding Britain.<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

In the evening of [[1 May]], [[1998]], Firenze stood with the remaining teachers and members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] who had arrived to fight after Snape's ousting.<ref name="DH31" /> 

[[Minerva McGonagall]] talked to students about how the underage among them, and those who were not willing to fight, were going to be evacuated before the start of the battle that would soon ensue, as Voldemort and his Death Eaters were going to start their attack at midnight.<ref name="DH31" />

[[File:Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|left|Firenze witnesses Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the Second Wizarding War|alt=]]
Firenze stayed to fight, and was seriously injured on his flank which poured copious amounts of [[blood]]. He was laid on the raised platform at the [[Great Hall]] during the hour-long fighting interregnum, and was shaking and unable to stand by himself.<ref name="DH33">{{DH|B|33}}</ref> Given his state, it is most likely Firenze did not partake in the second half of the Battle. It is likely, however, that Firenze witnessed the [[Voldemort's Last Stand|duel]] between Harry and Voldemort in the Great Hall and Voldemort's final defeat.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>

A celebration feast was later held, but teachers, parents and students were all jumbled up. Firenze, however, lay recovering in a corner after having received treatment by [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]].<ref name="DH36" />

===Later life===
After the Battle, Firenze was welcomed back into his colony, when they were forced to acknowledge that Firenze's pro-human leanings were not shameful, but honourable.<ref name="JKLC">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html "J.K. Rowling and the Live Chat, Bloomsbury.com, July 30, 2007 (2.00-3.00pm BST)"] on [http://www.accio-quote.org/index.html Accio Quote!]</ref> Despite this, he still remained a [[Divination]] professor at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], continuing to share the role with [[Sybill Trelawney]].<ref name="Of Horse And Man">{{WU}} - "An overnight seminar is hosted in the [[Forbidden Forest]] by Firenze, [[centaur]] and [[Divination]] teacher at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]."</ref>

In a winter between [[2008]] and [[2015]], Firenze greeted [[Robyn Thistlethwaite]] and [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|her friend]] outside the [[Forbidden Forest]] and warned them not to go in despite their interest in investigating a case that possibly involved a [[Yeti]].<ref name="MA">{{MA}} - [[December]] [[2021]] special event (it's unclear in what in-universe year the event is set)</ref>

During the [[Calamity]], Firenze helped members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] who sought a Magizoologist profession by leading a week-long [[Camp Firenze|camp]] to enhance their physical attributes,<ref name="Camp Firenze">{{WU}} - [https://web.archive.org/web/20210612175133/https://wizardsunitehub.info/profession-skill/camp-firenze/ Camp Firenze]</ref>
while he offered a mind-over-matter seminar to those who sought a Professorship profession to increase their focus.<ref name="Master Mind">{{WU}} - [https://web.archive.org/web/20210121024604/https://wizardsunitehub.info/profession-skill/master-mind/ Master Mind]</ref> He also offered an interactive overnight seminar in the [[Forbidden Forest]] regarding astronomical [[Divination]], which was attended by a [[Calamity Investigator]] working for the Task Force.<ref name="Of Horse And Man" />

==Physical appearance==
Firenze was a centaur with a palomino [[horse]] hindbody and blond [[human]] hair. He had blue eyes and looked younger than both Bane and Ronan.<ref name="PS15" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Do you not see that unicorn? Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.|Firenze defending his helping of [[human]]s|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Firenze was a courageous [[centaur]] who was not as traditional or proud as most of his kind.<ref name="PS15"/> Whereas most centaurs believed it was shameful to work alongside humans, Firenze was happy to allow Harry to ride him.<ref name="PS15"/> and became a teacher at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].<ref name="OP27"/>

Firenze was willing to stand up for what he believed in even if it meant defying his colony;<ref name="PS15"/> unfortunately this resulted in him nearly being stomped to death by the other centaurs.<ref name="OOTP30"/> However, after the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], his colony acknowledged his ways as being honourable and welcomed him back.

He was friendly with [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]],<ref name="PS15"/> and seemed to get on quite well with [[Harry Potter]],<ref name="PS15"/> who was on speaking terms with him unlike most students, who initially found him intimidating.<ref name="OP27"/>

Like all centaurs, Firenze commonly tried to read the future in the stars, and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] considered him to be a slightly better teacher than [[Sybill Trelawney]], though he was still frustrated that Firenze seemed to be able to provide very little definite information.<ref name="OP27"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|Centaurs have unravelled the mysteries of these movements over centuries. Our findings teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us...|Firenze's attitude towards Divination|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
*'''[[Divination]]''': Being a [[Centaur]] (and therefore a natural-born [[Seer]]), Firenze was naturally gifted in the [[magic]]al art of divination, and even taught the [[Divination (class)|subject]] at Hogwarts from 1996-1998. Being a centaur, Firenze performed divination through observing planets, [[moon]]s and stars, and had a low opinion of human divination, viewing it as nonsensical.<ref name="OP27"/> 
*'''Combat''': Firenze was also highly skilful in physical combat as he notably saved [[Harry Potter]]'s life in the [[Forbidden Forest]] by charging at [[Quirinus Quirrell]] and forcing him to flee before he could attack Harry. This was especially notable as Quirrell was possessed by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] at the time, which enhanced his magical powers, although Voldemort was also in a weakened form at the time.<ref name="PS15"/> Despite getting injured in the first half of the battle,<ref name="DH33"/> he also survived the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] with no fatal injury.<ref name="DH36"/>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Firenze WU.png|150px|thumb|Firenze as he appears in {{WU}}]]
*He is portrayed by [[Ray Fearon]] in {{PS|FA}}, but does not appear in any of the later films.
*In the [[Harry Potter (book series)|books]], Firenze is said to have silver-blond hair and is even considered handsome by some students. In the ''Philosopher's Stone'' film, however, he has dark hair. He doesn't stay with Harry or let him ride on his back either, because [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and the others appear straight away.
*It is possible that Firenze is based on the legend of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron Chiron], a centaur from Greek mythology who left his "wild and lusty" brethren to instead tutor heroes.
*In the film of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,'' Firenze is shown to have strikingly, almost glowing, amber eyes instead of blue eyes.
*Firenze is the fourth known professor to not be completely human, after [[Filius Flitwick]] (part-[[goblin]]), [[Remus Lupin]] (a [[werewolf]]), and Rubeus Hagrid (a half-[[giant]]).
*In addition, out of all the known professors at Hogwarts (including [[Cuthbert Binns]], who was a wizard during his lifetime and is now a ghost), Firenze is the only one who is not a wizard.

==Etymology==
*"Firenze" is the Italian name for the city of [[Wikipedia:Florence|Florence]]. It is interesting to note that Galileo Galilei, one of history's greatest astronomers, lived out his final years there. Firenze's teaching of Divination deals with Astrology and Astronomy, as opposed to Trelawney's fortune-telling, hence this connection.
*The meaning of the name Firenze is Flower, Blossom.
