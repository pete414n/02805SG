This '''individual''' was a knight and a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] in his life, who died when he was shot by an arrow in his forehead. He returned after his death as a ghost.


On [[31 October]], [[1992]], he attended [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]]'s [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|five-hundredth deathday party]] at [[Hogwarts Castle]] and engaged in conversation with the [[Fat Friar]].


*It is unknown if this ghost resided at [[Hogwarts Castle]], or if he only came there to celebrate Sir Nicholas's Deathday. If the former is true, he may be intended to be the [[Black Knight]], a ghost ultimately cut from [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|the first book]].
*It has also been speculated that he is the ghost of [[Wikipedia:Harold Godwinson|Harold II]] (1022â€”1066), the last Saxon king of [[England]]. Harold was defeated at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 by William the Conqueror when an arrow pierced his eye.
