'''Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy''' (b. [[2006]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[pure-blood]] He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[2017]] and onwards and was sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. He was a classmate of [[Rose Granger-Weasley]] and [[Albus Potter]], and he made a strong bond with the latter. He, however, struggled with a mistaken belief held by many against him that he was secretly the son of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and not Draco Malfoy.



Scorpius was born circa [[2006]] to [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]]. He was raised in [[Malfoy Manor]] and was said to have inherited his father's and [[Lucius Malfoy|grandfather]]'s looks; blonde hair, grey eyes, and a pale pointed face. In contrast to his parents and grandparents, Scorpius was not raised with traditional [[pure-blood]] beliefs that taught him to regard [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and non-pure-blood wizards as inferior, so he was much more tolerant of them.

Childhood for Scorpius was one of isolation within Malfoy Manor. He had no interactions with children of his age before he began attending at Hogwarts. Scorpius read the Malfoy collection of books, and became knowledgeable about the [[wizarding world]], the [[Second Wizarding War]] and [[Harry Potter]], through reading these books.


First year


In [[2017]], Scorpius was accompanied by his parents to [[King's Cross Station]] to go to his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Others in his year included [[Albus Potter]] and [[Rose Granger-Weasley]]; Rose was discouraged by her father from becoming "too friendly" with Scorpius and was encouraged to beat him in every test.

Scorpius sat in an empty compartment on the [[Hogwarts Express]] until he was later joined by Albus and Rose. He awkwardly introduced himself and said he had sweets they can share. Rose decided to leave but Albus stayed, joking that he only did for the sweets. They shared the sweets along with stories on their journey to Hogwarts, beginning their friendship.

Scorpius was sorted into [[Slytherin]] and sat next to Albus at the [[Start-of-Term Feast]]. He had a hard time at Hogwarts since his fellow students made jokes about his parentage while they also mocked Albus for being a Potter in Slytherin. Regardless, he and Albus became great friends and Scorpius encouraged him to ignore what the students were saying about them. He also developed a crush on [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] but she did not return his feelings.

Third year
Shortly before his third year at Hogwarts, in the summer of [[2019]], Scorpius lost his mother to [[Blood malediction|an illness]] which left him and his father grief-stricken and heart-broken. Meeting Albus on Platform 9Â¾, he asked his friend to come to the funeral.

Fourth year
Fleeing the Hogwarts Express

Before going to school for his fourth year, Albus told his father that he was having a hard time at school. Harry was hurt by learning this and thought Scorpius was the reason why, requesting Albus end his friendship with him, but Albus refused to give up his best friend.

On the Hogwarts Express, when Albus told him about his meeting with [[Amos Diggory]] and the discovery of a [[Time-Turner]], they made a plan to retrieve the Time-Turner and travel back in time to save [[Cedric Diggory]]. They tried to jump from the train by climbing up to the roof through a window only to find the [[trolley witch]], who tried to stop them from leaving the moving train. They later managed to find [[Delphini|Delphi]], who had agreed to help Albus.

Working with Delphini

They travelled to [[St Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards|St Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards]] where he met [[Amos Diggory]] and Delphi. They agreed to a plan and with Delphi's help, Albus, Scorpius, and Delphi used [[Polyjuice Potion]] to disguise themselves as Ron, Harry, and Hermione respectively and sneaked into the [[Ministry of Magic]]. Scorpius, as Harry, helped to solve a series of puzzles from Hermione's bookcase where they finally discovered and stole the Time-Turner.

Leaving Delphi behind, Albus and Scorpius used the Time-Turner to travel to the [[Triwizard Tournament]]'s first task where they dressed up as [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]] students and intervened with Cedric's part by making him lose his wand. After five minutes, they returned to the present.

Albus and Scorpius discovered that they had created an [[alternate reality]] where Cedric still died, and Hermione and Ron never got together meaning Rose no longer existed. Albus is not in Slytherin anymore and Harry tells Albus he will have to end his friendship with Scorpius and that he will be keeping an eye on him to ensure he does.


They returned to normal school life where Albus and Scorpius did not speak anymore. Eventually, Delphi turned up at Hogwarts and made Albus and Scorpius reconcile. They decided to put their mistake right and hoped that by intervening with the second task, they would properly save Cedric.

They succeeded and returned to the present only to find that they had created another alternate reality. Cedric survived and became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. Cedric killed [[Neville Longbottom]], who had been crucial to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s defeat who won instead. Harry Potter died meaning Albus did not exist anymore either, leaving Scorpius alone to try and right their mistake. 

In the alternate timeline [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] is the head of magical law enforcement, [[Dolores Umbridge]] is the Headmistress of Hogwarts, and Scorpius is known as the "Scorpion King".

With the help of resistance fighters [[Severus Snape]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], Scorpius later managed to change time again by time-travelling to the past and using a [[Shield Charm]] to stop his other self intervening. He restored the original timeline along with Albus and Rose back into existence.

Scorpius and Albus returned to the present through the [[Great Lake]], where they were found by their parents. With the approval of [[Harry Potter|Harry]], they were allowed to keep their friendship. They tell their parents that they lost the [[Time-Turner]] although Scorpius later admitted to Albus that he knows he lost it in the lake. They decided to retrieve it and destroy it. They invited [[Delphini|Delphi]] to help.

Trapped in 1981
When they met her, Scorpius noticed that [[Delphini|Delphi]] had an [[Augurey]] tattoo, which reminded him of a witch in the alternate reality where [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] won. He realised that she was raised by the [[Rowle family|Rowles]], who were well known [[Death Eaters]]. Delphi then revealed that she was never actually planning to destroy the Time-Turner, and that she hoped to revive [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. She snapped their wands and killed [[Craig Bowker Junior|Craig Bowker Jnr]] who was sent to find them, before she made Albus and Scorpius travel back in time with her to the third task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]].

Albus and Scorpius, knowing the Time-Turner only kept them in the past for five minutes, tried to stall Delphi and ended up meeting Cedric Diggory in the maze. Cedric helped Albus and Scorpius and retrieved the Time-Turner, believing it to be part of the tournament. As he left, Albus and Scorpius told him that his father Amos loved him. However, Delphi managed to get the Time-Turner back and went back in time to [[30 October]] [[1981]], the day before [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]] died. Delphi then destroyed the Time-Turner and left, abandoning Albus and Scorpius.


Believing Delphi hoped to murder Harry herself so the spell wouldn't rebound on Voldemort, Albus and Scorpius went to [[Godric's Hollow]] and saw James and Lily alive with their baby Harry. To warn everyone in the future what is happening, Albus and Scorpius used Harry's blanket to send a message through time. Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Draco deciphered the message and used a more advanced Time-Turner to travel back to 1981 and join their children.

[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] realised Delphi only meant to stop Voldemort going into the house and murdering the Potters, so his downfall never happened. Harry transfigured himself to look like Voldemort and planned to apprehend Delphi. Delphi pleaded with Voldemort, actually Harry, to accept her. However, the Transfiguration spell faded, and Delphi and Harry duelled. Scorpius and the others joined Harry and finally stopped Delphi. They then returned to the present.

Returning to present time
After their traumatic experiences with the time-turner, Albus and Scorpius returned to normal life and Scorpius asked Rose out, and she turned him down, but Scorpius was excited because she had pity in her eyes and not hate, saying it "was a foundation for a palace of love" and Rose later talked to Scorpius and called him "Scorpion King" then left with a smile on her face.


Scorpius inherited his father [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s physical traits, meaning that he likely had blond hair, grey eyes, and a pale pointed face. He was also noted for looking almost the same as his father did at age eleven. He was said to resemble Draco as much as [[Albus Potter]] resembled [[Harry Potter]].



Scorpius was shown to be a brave, intelligent, and understanding individual. However, despite his traits, he was shown to be incredibly lonely and insecure, who suffered from slight depression throughout his childhood and eventual years at Hogwarts. Scorpius was noted to be extremely kind, according to Albus.

Scorpius was known to have a personality that Albus and himself describe as "nerdy" and "geeky", and was known to be something of a loner. A consummate social outcast, Scorpius relied on his romantic and amorous personality to lighten his burdens in life. A particular trait of his was his long-standing romantic interest in [[Rose Granger-Weasley]], his best friend's cousin and unreachable goal. Scorpius was rather persistent when he wanted something and vaguely shows his ambitious side in the fact that no other girl has ever caught his eye before, potentially referencing another part of his identity he, himself had yet to figure out. His overall neutral want to restore Rose's existence to the timeline shows that his interest in her was apparently more than just a simple schoolboy crush to the audience and can be implied that he actually [[love]]s her. However, this desperation to restore a timeline was sidelined by the overwhelming relationship between Scorpius and Albus as well as the confirmation from [[Severus Snape|Snape]] that Scorpius was generally "giving up his kingdom" by restoring the timelines all for Albus.

Living in a timeline without Albus being his friend was shown to be more unbearable and saddening for Scorpius than living in a timeline without Rose's existence altogether.


Scorpius was also known to be prone to feelings of jealousy. His jealousy was shown from when Scorpius once observed Albus showing interest in a girl, [[Delphini|Delphi]]. In an alternate timeline when Albus was ordered by his father to stay away from Scorpius, Delphi admitted that in the letters Albus wrote to her so she could feel Scorpius's absence from his life. Scorpius retorted that it seemed like he had found another shoulder to cry on and inquired how many owls they had sent to one another. Through his backhanded comment, this jealousy can be inferred, but it was unknown what these complicated feelings really meant.

In another alternate timeline where Albus was never born and Voldemort ruled, Scorpius was apparently more of a bully, as he allegedly forced [[Craig Bowker Junior|Craig Bowker Jnr]] to do his homework for him. The Scorpius who inadvertently made this timeline shift was rather surprised and shocked at this revelation.


*'''[[Charm]]s''': Scorpius demonstrated a proficiency with charm-work from a young age, being able to perform a number of highly useful charms successfully, such as the [[Cushioning Charm]], [[Engorgement Charm]], [[Shield Charm]] and [[Unlocking Charm]].
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Scorpius was highly knowledgeable of [[potion]]s, being able to understand how potions were brewed correctly, along with mistakes in potion making. His friend [[Albus Potter]] described him as a "Potions expert", showing his proficiency in this field. He was also knowledgeable about [[love potion]]s and their composition.



*'''[[Scorpius Malfoy's wand|Wand]]''': Scorpius owned a [[wand]] which was made of [[willow]] and was of unknown length and [[Wand core|core]] material. He presumably purchased it from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]] before starting his [[first year]] in [[2017]], and used it through his school years.



Scorpius had a close relationship with both his parents. He loved his [[Astoria Malfoy|mother]] very much, and was very grief-stricken by her death. He believed she saw the best in him and his [[Draco Malfoy|father]]. His relationship with his father was slightly different, but he loved and admired him very much, believing he could depend on him to save him. He confided in his father who he relied on for comfort following his mother's death and had his approval for his friendship with Albus. Astoria and Draco raised Scorpius with the love and affection they did not have when they were children, and cared for him and his wellbeing. Unlike Draco himself, they did not spoil Scorpius, nor teach him their families' historical prejudice against Muggles. Indeed, when Scorpius and Albus were facing punishment for using the Time-Turner that caused a catastrophic change in reality (that he managed to reverse), Draco was prepared to accept any punishment that Professor McGonagall was about to hand down to the students.




Scorpius became friends with [[Albus Potter]] when they met on the [[Hogwarts Express]] during their first journey to Hogwarts, even though Albus was the son of Harry Potter, the former archrival of Scorpius's father. They awkwardly introduced themselves and shared a compartment, sharing sweets and stories. They were later placed in [[Slytherin]] together and became close during their first few years at Hogwarts even though they were made fun of by other students. Albus became isolated because of the jokes being made about him which led Harry to believe that Scorpius was the one influencing him instead. He told Albus to end his friendship with Scorpius which he refused to do.

In their fourth year, Scorpius decided to help Albus change the past by time-travelling to 1994 and trying to save [[Cedric Diggory]]. In one [[alternate reality]], they did not speak to each other for a few weeks when Harry told Albus to end their friendship again, which immensely upset Scorpius. Regardless, the two later made up and took another trip in time. Scorpius was upset when he found out they had created another alternate reality where Albus no longer existed, and resolved to put time right again. 


He was later happily reunited with Albus where which he hugged him while submerged in water. On their next trip in time, he helps him and Harry duel Delphi. They later returned to normal school life, with the approval of Harry to be friends again.

The two boys are known to also have a rather close relationship in which hugging often takes place.



Scorpius was apparently romantically interested in [[Rose Granger-Weasley]], complimenting her by saying she smelled of something nice, "like a mixture of fresh flowers and fresh bread". After helping to restore Rose's existence in the current timeline, he attempted to hug her after she called him "Bread-head", but was welcomed with a kick to the shin. Near the end of his fourth year, Scorpius asked Rose out, however, he was rejected. Interestingly, at the very last moment, Rose passed Scorpius and Albus on the stairs. She told him, "This is only going to be weird if you let it be weird," to which he responded, "Received and totally understood." She called him "Scorpion King" and walked off with a smile on her face. It is unknown what this means.


*The word ''Scorpius'' is Latin for "scorpion". Like his father (and to an extension of the [[House of Black|Black family]]), Scorpius was named after a [[Wikipedia:Scorpius|constellation]], carrying on the tradition of giving astronomical names, started by the [[House of Black|family]] of his paternal [[Narcissa Malfoy|grandmother]].
