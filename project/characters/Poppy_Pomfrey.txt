{{Quote|Madam Pomfrey, the matron, was a nice woman, but very strict.|Pomfrey's stern and kind disposition|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
'''Madam Poppy Pomfrey''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] or [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the matron at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She was a very competent [[Healer]], having been in the position for, at least, the last quarter of the [[20th century]].

Madam Pomfrey was very possessive of the patients in her care while in the [[Hospital Wing]], and their visitors upset her somewhat, as she frequently insisted they must rest and demanded the visitors leave. She was proficient in her area of expertise ([[healing magic]]) and able to take care of some ailments "''in a heartbeat''". She fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], the final battle of the [[Second Wizarding War]], during which she personally dispatched at least one Death Eater in a duel, and was seen after the battle treating the wounded and attending to the dead.

Not much is known about Madam Pomfrey's life after the final battle. By [[2014]], she had retired or was thinking of retiring, since [[Hannah Abbott]] reportedly applied for the position of matron at Hogwarts.

==Biography==
===Matron at Hogwarts===
Madam Pomfrey began her career at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] sometime before [[1971]], being trusted in that year by [[Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore]] to escort new [[Gryffindor]] student [[Remus Lupin]], who was infected with [[lycanthropy]] due to a bite from [[Fenrir Greyback]], to the [[Whomping Willow]] every full moon.

At some point before [[1 November]], [[1981]], Madam Pomfrey complimented Dumbledore on a set of [[earmuffs]] he had recently acquired. The compliment made him blush in such a manner that would only be rivalled when [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] compared his [[magic]]al prowess favourably against those of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]].

====[[1985–1986 school year]]====
[[File:Jacob's sibling entering Hospital Wing HM24.png|right|thumb|250px|Jacob's sibling approaching Madam Pomfrey in the Hospital Wing]]
In addition to treating [[Ben Copper]], [[Rowan Khanna]], and [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], all of whom at various times throughout the year was injured by the [[cursed ice]] spreading throughout the castle, an assortment of injuries caused by [[Quidditch]], [[duelling]], classroom accidents and general clumsiness kept Poppy very busy, including a student who was [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] into a teapot.

The same year, she enlisted [[Jacob's sibling]] to be her assistant, impressed with their bedside manner when their friend Ben was injured. One of the things she tasked said assistant with was researching sleepwalking, and teaching them to [[Episkey|fix relatively minor injuries in a heartbeat]].

====[[1987–1988 school year]]====
In addition to caring for students stricken by the [[sleepwalking curse]], she took time to teach [[Jacob's sibling]] the [[Bandaging Charm]].

====[[1988–1989 school year]]====
During this school year, Madam Pomfrey treated an injured [[Rowan Khanna]] in the Hospital Wing, who had fallen victim to the [[Imperius Curse]], much to her correct assumption. She explained the nature of the [[curse]] to [[Jacob's sibling]] when they came to visit them, while [[Patricia Rakepick]] and [[Severus Snape]] were too present. Following an argument between the two rival [[Professor]]s, she told the two of them to take their arguing outside like bickering children.

Towards the end of the school year, when Jacob's sibling and their friends arrived in the [[Great Hall]] via [[Vault portrait|Portkey]] following their expedition into the [[Buried Vault]], Madam Pomfrey took a severely injured [[Merula Snyde]] up to the Hospital Wing, as she had been tortured with Rakepick's [[Cruciatus Curse]].

====[[1989–1990 school year]]====
[[File:Pomfrey Petrified.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Madam Pomfrey petrified by the statue curse]]
Poppy Pomfrey dedicated much of her time treating two students who had been [[Petrification|petrified]] as a result of the [[statue curse]] as well as treating other students. She had help from a few students, including [[Chiara Lobosca]] and [[Cedric Diggory]]. At some point during the school year, Madam Pomfrey was petrified. Eventually, she was cured and continued to be the matron at Hogwarts.

====[[1990–1991 school year]]====
[[File:Madam Pomfrey pleased HM719.png|thumb|250px|right|Madam Pomfrey whilst tending to patients in the Hospital Wing]]
During this school, an infestation of [[Doxy|doxies]] swarmed [[Hogwarts Castle]] that left many students bitten with [[Doxy venom|venomous]] doxy bites, making them seek treatment in the Hospital Wing, where Madam Pomfrey cared for them. As Madam Pomfrey and the Hospital Wing were overwhelmed with students suffering from doxy bites, she enlisted the help of some [[Seventh year|seventh-year]] students to help her look after the injured students: [[Chiara Lobosca]], [[Victor Ketsueki]] and [[Penny Haywood]]. Jacob's sibling also showed up to help Pomfrey treat the students. Jacob's sibling helped Madam Pomfrey treat a student with stomach ache in the Hosptial Wing as part of their [[St Mungo's student programme|assignment]] in learning how to become a [[Healer]] with [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]].

====[[1991–1992 school year]]====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Harry Potter|You let Professor Dumbledore in....|Poppy|Well, of course, that was the Headmaster, quite different. You need ''rest''.|I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on Madam Pomfrey....|Harry pleading with Madam Pomfrey to allow Ron and Hermione to visit him|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
In [[1991]], Madam Pomfrey was able to mend [[Neville Longbottom]]'s broken arm in "about a minute" after he had injured himself during [[Flying (class)|Flying class]].

In [[1992]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] was required to go to Madam Pomfrey after visiting [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and being bitten by the [[dragon]] [[Norberta]]. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] told her that he had been bitten by a dog, but Madam Pomfrey had doubts about his honesty due to the unusual colour of the purple, green, and black wound. However, she did not press him and treated him regardless.

[[File:B1C17M2 Harry's first Hospital Wing stay.png|250px|thumb|Harry Potter on bed rest after the attack in the Underground Chambers, as ordered by Madam Pomfrey]]
Later on in the year, after [[Harry Potter]] fought [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] in the Hogwarts dungeons for possession of the [[Philosopher's Stone]], he spent three days unconscious in the hospital wing under Madam Pomfrey's care. She was reluctant for Harry to have any visitors, even Ron Weasley and [[Hermione Granger]], as she thought that Harry needed bed rest, but she allowed headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] to visit Harry time to time, saying that the reason he was allowed to visit was because he was the Headmaster.

====[[1992–1993 school year]]====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Poppy|You should have come straight to me!... I can mend bones in a second — but growing them back —|Harry Potter|You will be able to, won't you?|I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful... you'll have to stay the night....|Harry Potter and Madam Pomfrey in [[1992]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Pomfrey1992.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Pomfrey seeing to an injured Harry Potter after a disastrous Quidditch match]]
In 1992, Madam Pomfrey administered [[Skele-Gro]] on Harry to regrow the bones in his arm after [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s [[Brackium Emendo|attempt]] to fix a Quidditch-caused broken bone failed disastrously. Pomfrey was annoyed that Harry had not been brought straight to her in the first place, as re-growing bones is a much more difficult task than mending bones, which she claimed she could do "in a heartbeat".

In the same year, Hermione Granger ended up in the hospital wing for a month after an accident in an unauthorised high-level [[Potion|Potion-making]] ([[Polyjuice Potion]]) left her half-feline; apparently the group felt comfortable letting Madam Pomfrey to treat her since she would not ask too many questions and just get on with the job in hand. Hermione was allowed visitors, but it bothered Madam Pomfrey somewhat.

[[File:B2C14M1 Petrified students in the Hospital Wing.jpg|250px|thumb|Madam Pomfrey attending Hermione Granger's bedside after she was [[Petrification|Petrified]]]]
Hogwarts was also facing potential closure as a [[Serpent of Slytherin|monster]] had been attacking Muggle-born students around the school and [[Full Body-Bind Curse|Petrifying]] them as a result. It was Madam Pomfrey's job to make sure that these students were found and treated to the best of her ability, though she could not cure students without [[Pomona Sprout]]'s [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]], which took weeks to brew. She refused to allow any students to visit the victims, in fear of the attacker returning to finish them, but allowed Harry and Ron to visit Hermione with [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s permission. 

[[File:Dumbledore, Pomfrey and Sprout at the End-of-Term Feast.PNG|250px|thumb|left|Dumbledore, Pomfrey and Sprout at the End-of-Term Feast]]
Eventually, they managed to get the potion made and cured the victims — Hermione Granger, [[Colin Creevey]], [[Penelope Clearwater]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]], and [[Mrs Norris]]. At the end of the year, Madam Pomfrey and Professor Sprout sat at the staff table and Albus Dumbledore asked the whole school to thank them both for their efforts in helping all petrified students, as well as applauding in Lockhart's departure and Hagrid's return.

====[[1993–1994 school year]]====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Poppy|Oh, it's you is it?... I suppose you've been doing something dangerous again?|Minerva McGonagall|It was a dementor, Poppy.|Setting dementors around a school... He won't be the last one that collapses. Yes, he's all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they have on people who are already delicate —|Poppy and [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] discussing the effect that Dementors had on people|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Madam Pomfrey and Professor Sprout clapping COSF.jpg|250px|thumb|Pomfrey and [[Pomona Sprout]] seated at the [[High Table]] in the [[Great Hall]]]]
During the [[1993–1994 school year]], Hogwarts found itself under the questionable protection of the [[Dementor]]s of [[Azkaban]], horrible creatures whose mere presence was enough to induce the worst feelings and sensations in people. When one took it upon itself to inspect the [[Hogwarts Express]] for the escaped criminal [[Sirius Black]], it caused many students great distress and actually caused Harry Potter to pass out due to recalling his mother's death. Madam Pomfrey was summoned to Minerva McGonagall's office to see if Harry was alright and administer treatment. 

While inspecting the boy, she exchanged a significant look with Professor McGonagall and expressed her disapproval of setting Dementors around the school, anticipating many more collapses all over the place due to the effect they had on people, particularly those who were 'delicate'. Madam Pomfrey recommended some [[chocolate]], but was surprised and very pleased to hear that he had already been given some by the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, [[Remus Lupin]].

During the [[Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match (1993)|1993 Quidditch match]] between [[Gryffindor]] and [[Hufflepuff]], Madam Pomfrey tended to the injured, including Harry Potter, who fell over fifty feet due to Dementors being on the pitch, a Hufflepuff team member, and [[Angelina Johnson]] who was injured after the tail of her broomstick caught [[fire]].

At the end of 1994, Harry, Ron, and Hermione all had endured injuries following the events that took place when Sirius Black returned to Hogwarts and revealed [[Peter Pettigrew]] to be alive. The three all woke up in the hospital wing, Ron having broken his leg, and both Harry and Hermione having passed out from the Dementor attack, along with Sirius Black. Madam Pomfrey was not surprised to have the three in her care again.

[[File:Dumbledore, Pomfrey and Sprout at the End-of-Term Feast.PNG|250px|thumb|left|Pomfrey sitting with fellow staff members in the Great Hall]]
Whilst in the Hospital Wing, Hermione, at Dumbledore's hint, used her [[Time-Turner]] to go back in time with Harry to three hours previously. They rescued Sirius Black on [[Buckbeak]] the hippogriff to prevent him from being administered the [[Dementor's Kiss]]. They managed to get back in time without Madam Pomfrey realising what they had done, something that would have caused dire consequences. 

Madam Pomfrey also spoke approvingly of Remus Lupin's use of chocolate to relieve the effects of a Dementor's presence on students, commenting that Hogwarts has "''finally got a [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher who knows his remedies''", as the previous DADA predecessors were not particularly good teachers with any real expertise.

====[[1994–1995 school year]]====
{{Quote|Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next?|Madam Pomfrey complaining about the Triwizard Tournament|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
When several students, including [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Fawcett|S. Fawcett]], and [[Summers]] "''decided to age themselves up a little''" in order to be eligible to enter the 1994 [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Madam Pomfrey subsequently had to remove the beards which they had grown in attempting to cross Dumbledore's [[Age Line]]. She was most annoyed by the students actions and treated them with regret. She felt that the [[Triwizard Tournament]] would bring the school nothing but grief.

During the same school year, it was Madam Pomfrey's job to tend to the injuries that the four Triwizard Champions — Harry Potter, [[Viktor Krum]], [[Fleur Delacour]], and [[Cedric Diggory]] — received during the course of the tournament, and expressed distaste for the dragons for the first task.

[[File:B4C36M1 Snape Dark Mark reveal.png|250px|thumb|Snape using his Dark Mark as proof that Voldemort had returned]]
She was also responsible for later taking the body of Cedric Diggory to the Hospital Wing after he had been murdered by Peter Pettigrew under the order of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the last task. Later, after being questioned by Albus Dumbledore on the details of the incident, Harry was sent to the hospital where Madam Pomfrey prescribed a [[Potion for Dreamless Sleep|Dreamless Sleep Potion]] for him, in order for him to get some rest. Madam Pomfrey was also present when Minister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] visited the wing; the Minister refused to believe that Voldemort returned, causing ex-[[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] Professor Snape to reveal his restored [[Dark Mark]] as proof.

====1995–1996 school year====
{{Quote|I don't wonder you're shocked, Potter, as if one of them could have stunned Minerva McGonagall face-on by daylight! Cowardice, that's what it was... despicable cowardice... if I wasn't worried what would happen to you students without me, I'd resign in protest!|Madam Pomfrey to Harry Potter on her intention to resign|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
In 1996, Hogwarts was under the control of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. Albus Dumbledore had escaped after facing potential imprisonment in Azkaban and [[Dolores Umbridge]] had taken over as Headmistress. [[Minerva McGonagall]], Madam Pomfrey's close friend, was hit by four [[Stunning Spell]]s to the chest by [[Auror]]s while Umbridge was trying to sack and remove Hagrid from Hogwarts, very nearly killing her in the process. Madam Pomfrey was deeply shocked by this attack and was unable to help McGonagall. She transferred her to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] where she could receive better treatment by qualified healers.

Also, after the [[Dumbledore's Army]]'s traitor, [[Marietta Edgecombe]], was struck with Hermione Granger's [[Dumbledore's Army parchment jinx]], Madam Pomfrey could not do the slightest in improving the pustules instilled on Marietta's face. Marietta was stuck with this reminder of her betrayal into the next school year, where not even a heavy layer of makeup could fully obscure the marks. That school year, she also healed [[Alicia Spinnet]]'s eyebrows after they were [[jinx]]ed by [[Miles Bletchley]], and also administered a [[Calming Draught]] to [[Hannah Abbott]] after she had burst into tears during a [[Herbology]] class over anxiety surrounding her upcoming [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]s.

Madam Pomfrey considered resigning in protest after the attack on McGonagall, but did not as she cared and feared for the students too much.

====[[1996–1997 school year]]====
{{Quote|No more than six visitors at a time!|Pomfrey enforcing the rules of the Hospital Wing|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
In 1997, Madam Pomfrey examined [[Katie Bell]] after she had been [[curse]]d by an [[Opal Necklace]]. She could not help Bell and transferred her to St Mungo's for specialist treatment.

[[File:Madam Pomfrey treating Ron Weasley in the Hospital Wing HBPF.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Poppy attending to Ron Weasley after he was poisoned]]
Madam Pomfrey later tended to Ron after he had almost been [[poison]]ed after drinking a glass of [[mead]], which had been laced by [[Draco Malfoy]] in an attempt to kill Dumbledore.

She also helped Harry after his skull was cracked open by a [[Bludger]] which had been hit by [[Cormac McLaggen]] (whom she had presumably treated when he foolishly ate a pound of toxic [[Doxy egg]]s the previous year) during a Quidditch match; the injury was mended in an instant, but she kept him in overnight so as to ensure he did not undergo anything strenuous, which included taking revenge on McLaggen for his actions.

[[File:Ron, Luna, & Pomfrey raise wands.jpg|250px|thumb|Poppy raising her wand with students]]
Later in the year, the [[Death Eaters]] attacked Hogwarts. Several students and Aurors were caught up in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], a battle which resulted in the death of headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Madam Pomfrey tended to the wounds and injuries of those in the battle; [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] was injured the worst of all, as werewolf [[Fenrir Greyback]] in human form had savaged and bitten him, causing Bill to be badly scarred. Madam Pomfrey noted that there is no cure for werewolf bites and scars. 

Lupin, being a werewolf himself, assumed that Bill would not take the form of a true werewolf since he might not be entirely infected with Lycanthropy due to Greyback being in a human form when the attack happened, though he could develop lupine qualities. Since it was an unique case, neither Madam Pomfrey nor the others knew what would become of Bill when he awoke. When he woke up, the only change was that he developed a liking for raw meat.

[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|left|The funeral of Albus Dumbledore]]
Shortly afterwards, Madam Pomfrey was one of the hundreds of witches and wizards who attended the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore]]. During the funeral she paid her respects to the passing of a great wizard, friend, and colleague. She was devastated by his death, being brought to tears after Harry Potter told her of his demise at the hands of former colleague and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|DADA]] teacher [[Severus Snape]].

====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
{{Quote|I know that you are preparing to fight. Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood. Give me Harry Potter, and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. You have until midnight.|Lord Voldemort's ultimatum|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Defenders of Hogwarts in mourning.jpg|250px|thumb|Madam Pomfrey and others were shocked after seeing Harry's "dead" body]]
Following the death of former [[headmaster]] Albus Dumbledore, Lord Voldemort took control of Hogwarts and the [[Ministry of Magic]]. He had appointed Severus Snape as Headmaster, along with cruel Death Eaters [[Amycus Carrow|Amycus]] and [[Alecto Carrow]] as Defence Against the Dark Arts (renamed simply Dark Arts) and Muggle Studies professors respectively. Detentions and punishments imposed on students by the Carrows were severe. Students were noted to be in and out of the Hospital Wing often. In particular, [[Seamus Finnigan]]'s face was unrecognisable with bruises.

[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|left|Pomfrey witnessing Harry Potter's final defeat of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the end of the Second Wizarding War]]
Later on in the year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to Hogwarts in search of the final [[Horcrux]] in Hogwarts, triggering a battle. Before the battle started, she and [[Argus Filch]] were tasked with the evacuation of students from the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]] by [[Minerva McGonagall]]. The staff and students defended the school against Voldemort and his Death Eater army bravely whilst Harry searched for the Horcrux, with Poppy herself engaging and defeating a female Death Eater in the Great Hall.  At the end of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], many students and staff alike were injured or dead. After the battle, Madam Pomfrey tended to all the wounded.

===Later life===
She was still working at Hogwarts by [[2010]].

By [[2014]], Madam Pomfrey had retired or was thinking of retiring, since [[Hannah Abbott]] reportedly applied for the position of Matron at Hogwarts. In [[2019]], she assisted prospective members of the then recently established [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] seeking a career as [[Magizoologist]]s, whom she taught a rudimentary variation of the [[Mending Charm]], hoping it would help them in the field. Eventually, she would later teach the same members some advanced concepts relating to this spell, allowing them to improve its effectiveness. 

She also instructed them how to refine the [[Reviving Spell|Reviving Charm]] they learned from [[Rosmerta]] and upon being helped in tending to a student with a painful Quidditch injury, gave them practical advice over pain management to be applied to increase resilience. Regardless, either because she decided not to leave, or because she ended her retirement, she was working at Hogwarts in [[2020]].

In an [[alternate reality]] created when [[Albus Potter]] travelled back in time to [[1994]] and broke his arm in the process, Madame Pomfrey placed him in an induced sleep for twenty-four hours so that the arm could be reset. Unsure of what else to prescribe, she recommended eating lots of [[chocolate]].

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|No charm will work on these, I’ve tried everything I know, but there is no cure for [[werewolf]] bites.|Pomfrey excessively attending to Bill Weasley's wounds|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince}}
Madam Pomfrey was described by her students as being exceptionally kind, but even more so strict. She was very obsessive, lining up her patients' sweet boxes in neat rows, and was intensely worried about all of the students under her care, believing even feasts to be risky. Working in a school where magical accidents were almost an undeniable certainty, she appeared to have resigned herself to treating whoever came her way. Indeed, she never asked questions about how her patients received their ailments or questioning the sometimes ludicrous stories they told her, but instead immediately set to fixing them up.

She had a tendency to burst into tears at moments where great sorrow was appropriate, but she was capable of controlling herself if need be. She also has her standards and loyalty, as she would have resigned in protest when [[Minerva McGonagall]] was shot down by four Stunning Spells from a cowardly Ministry attack, were she not worried for the students.

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|She cleaned the cut with a dab of some [[Wound-Cleaning Potion|purple liquid]] that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.|Madam Pomfrey healing [[Harry Potter]]'s injured shoulder after the first task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Being the Hogwarts Matron, Madam Pomfrey was a talented [[Healer]] who was very well-versed in medical magic. She had a very high understanding of [[Healing spell|medical charms]] and could mend broken bones in seconds. [[Harry Potter]], for example, held her skill in Healing spells in very high regard.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': She was proficient in transfiguration, being able to quickly and [[Nonverbal spell|wordlessly]] [[Chair-conjuring spell|conjure a chair]] for [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] to sit on after hearing of the death of [[Albus Dumbledore]]. [[Conjuration]] was noted to be particularly advanced form of Transfiguration, showing her skill.
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Pomfrey was able to produce a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]. This was an impressive feat, as the Patronus Charm was noted to be extremely difficult.
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Pomfrey was very knowledgeable of healing potions and was skilled in their application. and her own tonic [[Pomfrey's Pick-Me-Up]], showing her to have been proficient in the art of potion-making.

==Possessions==
[[File:Poppy Pomfrey's Wand.jpg|thumb|Pomfrey's wand]]
*'''[[Poppy Pomfrey's wand|Wand]]''': Pomfrey owned a [[wand]], which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[wand core|core]].
*'''[[Poppy Pomfrey's office|Office]]''': Pomfrey occupied an office at Hogwarts in the [[Hospital Wing]], in which she used for her professional duties as well as her place of residence in the castle.

==Etymology==
*Poppy juice, better known as opium, is one of the oldest known medicines; it has been used as a painkiller and soporific for, at the very least, thousands of years. King Tutankhamun's tomb contained jars of poppy juice, presumably to relieve the pain he suffered from a head injury. Although it is mostly known today as an addictive drug, opium's derivatives, such as morphine and codeine, are vital to modern medicine for their anaesthetic properties.
*Pomfrey sounds like [[wikipedia:comfrey|comfrey]], a plant in the borage family which can be made into a soothing salve. Meanings of her names are, therefore, both in some way medically related. Pomfrey or Pomfret cakes (named after mediaeval names for the Yorkshire town of [[wikipedia:Pontefract|Pontefract]], once a centre of liquorice cultivation) are small, sweet lozenges made from the roots of the licorice plant. Liquorice also has been a medicinal ingredient for hundreds of years.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Gemma_Jones2.png|220x220px|thumb|[[Miriam Margolyes]] as [[Pomona Sprout]] and [[Gemma Jones]] as Poppy Pomfrey]]
[[File:Poppylego.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Poppy Pomfrey in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
[[File:Madam Pomfrey LEGO Y2.png|thumb|Poppy Pomfrey in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]
*"Matron" is a specific title used for a senior nurse at various institutions in Britain. In this context, a matron is the school nurse at a British boarding school, in charge of the general health and welfare of its students.
*Pomfrey is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actress [[Gemma Jones]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]],'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]''.
*In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]], Madam Pomfrey wears a cloth in her hair similar to caps worn by British Nurses at various points in history. Her uniform costume as seen in the second film is very similar and could be based on Victorian and Edwardian nurse's uniforms. Her uniform that we see in the 6th and 8th films is very similar and could be based on very early NHS nurse's uniforms from the 1940's and 50's.
*In the German audio books, Madam Pomfrey speaks with a French accent.
*In the books, the [[trio]] seems to place a lot of faith in Madam Pomfrey, to the point of overly doing so. When Dumbledore's hand was [[Curse on Marvolo Gaunt's ring|cursed]] and the damage remained visible, when Katie was [[Opal Necklace|cursed]], and when Dumbledore was greatly weakened by the [[Emerald Potion]], Harry always expected that Pomfrey would be able to cure them, and even suggesting in those situations that she be summoned for assistance, instead of the more Dark Arts-experienced Snape, who was more proficient in handling dangerous curses.
