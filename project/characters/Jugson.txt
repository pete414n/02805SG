{{Quote|Jugson, come here, we must be organised! We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary...|[[Lucius Malfoy]] to Jugson, during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Jugson''' was a [[Dark Wizard]] and a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. It is possible that he had been an [[Azkaban escapes#1996|Azkaban escapee]]. He fought in several battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]], including the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], after which he was defeated and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] along with fellow Death Eaters. It is possible that he escaped in [[1997]], along with other [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] convicts, and that he fought in several other battles, including the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. After the battle and [[Duel in the Great Hall|Voldemort's final defeat]], Jugson was presumably killed or imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] again.<ref name="OOTP35">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref>

==Biography==
{{Quote|Jugson, [[Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]], to that door...|[[Lucius Malfoy]] gives orders to the group of Death Eaters|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Jugson was one of the many Death Eaters who fought in the [[Second Wizarding War]]. It is unknown if he also fought in the [[First Wizarding War|First War]], and if he was imprisoned or he managed to avoid [[Azkaban]]. It is most likely that he was one of the Death Eaters who didn't search for Voldemort after his downfall.<ref name="OOTP35"/>

Jugson participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in [[1996]]. During the battle, Jugson temporarily separated from the other [[Death Eaters]], possibly because he wanted to capture [[Harry Potter]] or help [[Nott]] who was stunned, as [[Lucius Malfoy]], the commander, told him to "come here". He was paired with [[Antonin Dolohov]], and they pursued [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Neville Longbottom]], hitting all three with [[Impediment Jinx]]es. Afterwards, Harry struck him with a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]], leaving him incapacitated, though he likely came around on time to confront Harry in the Death Chamber with the other Death Eaters. He also likely took part in the resulting battle against the Order of the Phoenix members. He was presumably recaptured and sent to [[Azkaban]] following the battle.<ref name="OOTP35"/>

He likely broke out in [[1997]] and joined in [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] activities. It is possible that he fought in several other battles, including the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

After Voldemort's defeat, Jugson was presumably killed or imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] again, along with all the other surviving Death Eaters.

==Personality and traits==
Jugson seemed to be a somewhat impatient man, as shown when he shoved Dolohov aside after the latter had been hit with a [[Silencing Charm]]. Despite this he may have possibly cared about his comrades to an extent, as he may have been attempting to help [[Nott]] after he was injured when Lucius told him to "come here", though it is equally possible that he was merely trying to catch up to Harry Potter.<ref name="OOTP35"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Jugson was able to cast an [[Impediment Jinx]], along with [[Antonin Dolohov]], during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. They hit [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Neville Longbottom]], but Jugson was later hit by a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]].<ref name="OOTP35"/> He also likely took part in the battle against the Order of the Phoenix later on. It is possible that he also took part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, Jugson would have been proficient in the dark arts and the casting of various [[dark charm]]s, including the [[Unforgivable Curses]]. He was proficient with the casting of the [[Impediment Jinx]].<ref name="OOTP35"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Though unconfirmed, he may have been the bald Death Eater in {{DH|F1}} commenting on the Death Eaters infiltrating the ministry. He also may have been the Death Eater who ran into Hermione (disguised as Bellatrix) in Knockturn Alley in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]'', or the [[Unidentified Death Eater killed by Kingsley Shacklebolt|unidentified Death Eater killed by]] [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]].
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, it is [[Neville Longbottom]] who hits Jugson with a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] rather than Harry Potter, as he does in the book.

==Appearances==
*{{OOTP}} {{1st}}
*{{OOTP|F}}<ref>Despite this character not actually being identified in the film, there were more than ten [[Death Eaters]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and the character was identified in the book as being one of the Death Eaters present during that battle. In the book, both he and Dolohov are hit with the Full Body Bind, and Dolohov is identified in the Deathly Hallows film.</ref>
