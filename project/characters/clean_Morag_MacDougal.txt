She was the witch who [[Neville Longbottom]] had to give the [[Sorting Hat]] back to when he accidentally ran off with it after being sorted.


*Based on a list of students revealed by [[J. K. Rowling]] in , this character was originally named "Katrina" and later changed to "Isobel".
*A student named [[Morag]] appeared in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (PC, Mac)|PC version]] of [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' (video game)]]. She worked with matches in [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s [[Transfiguration (class)|transfiguration class]]. It is possible that this is Morag MacDougal, who may have repeated her first year. ([[Match to needle spell|Match to needle]] is a spell known to be covered in first year transfiguration classes.)


Morag is from Gaelic m√≥r, "tall." Dougall is from the Gaelic Dubhgall, or "dark stranger," and "Mac" is "son of."
