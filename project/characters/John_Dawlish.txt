==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|I seem to remember that you achieved 'Outstanding' in all your NEWTs...|Dawlish's impressive N.E.W.T. results|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
John was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], into the wizarding [[Dawlish family]] at some point before [[1975]] and attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he would achieve an impressive academic record by finishing his education earning at least five [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]],<ref name="Auror">In {{OOTP|B|29}}, Minerva McGonagall establishes that Aurors require a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s in order to be elegible for training to join the Auror Office.</ref> all of them with '[[Outstanding]]' marks.<ref name="OP27">{{OOTP|B|27}}</ref>

===Career as an Auror===
Sometime after his seventeenth birthday, Dawlish joined the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], and completed a stringent series of character and aptitude tests to be accepted into the comprehensive [[Auror training|three year long programme]] proscribed for the applicants of the [[Auror Office]].<ref name="OOTP29">{{OOTP|B|29}}</ref> Having successfully passed the skills and character requirements, in the years that followed, Dawlish fought and captured [[Dark Wizard]]s alongside [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Gawain Robards]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and others under the command of [[Rufus Scrimgeour]].

====Under Minister Cornelius Fudge====
{{Quote|Enough of this rubbish! Dawlish! Shacklebolt! Take him!|Cornelius Fudge orders [[Auror]]s to seize Albus Dumbledore|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Kingsleywithfudge.JPG|236x236px|thumb|left|John Dawlish with Dolores Umbridge, Cornelius Fudge, and Kingsley Shacklebolt in Dumbledore's office]]

On [[20 April]], [[1996]], after [[Marietta Edgecombe]] denounced the illegal [[Dumbledore's Army]] to [[Dolores Umbridge]], Minister [[Cornelius Fudge]] travelled to [[Hogwarts Castle]] in an attempt to expel [[Harry Potter]], who was leading the outlawed student group. [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and John Dawlish escorted the Minister there, and were positioned on either side of the door to the [[Headmaster's office]].<ref name="OP27" />

Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] took the blame instead, with a false confession. After Fudge accused him of treason and sedition against himself and the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], Fudge made a small choking noise, and then looked round at Kingsley and Dawlish. Dawlish nodded reassuringly and moved forwards, his hand drifting towards the wand in his pocket. Dumbledore warned him not to be foolish, saying that he would have to hurt Dawlish if he attacked him, and the [[Auror]] blinked rather foolishly, without a clue as to what to do next. Fudge ordered the Aurors to seize Dumbledore, but the [[Headmaster]] easily defeated the Ministry officials, leaving Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley and Dawlish unconscious on the floor as he escaped. Dawlish was the first to come to, stirring on the floor. When the wizards noted Dumbledore's absence, Dawlish fruitlessly tried to intercept him by wrenching the door to the office open and disappearing down the stairs, followed closely by Kingsley and Umbridge.<ref name="OP27" />

[[File:Auror Dawlish, Cornelius Fudge and Percy Weasley.JPG|250x250px|thumb|Dawlish alongside Cornelius Fudge and [[Percy Weasley]], after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]
In the early minutes of [[17 June]], just after midnight, Dawlish was among the number of Ministry officials who, led by Umbridge, attacked [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in order to arrest him and sack him from his positions of [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|Gamekeeper]] and [[Professor]]. While trying to [[Stunning Spell|stun]] him, Dawlish pleaded Hagrid to "be reasonable". It is unclear whether Dawlish was one of the Aurors physically knocked-out by Hagrid, or the one who, like Umbridge, was left unharmed, but tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over. In the course of the battle, Dawlish and his colleagues were also responsible for the near-fatal injury of [[Minerva McGonagall]] as she came running from the castle to try and prevent the attack on Hagrid, hitting her with four simultaneous Stunning Spells that resulted in her being committed to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] for treatment.<ref name="OP31">{{OOTP|B|31}}</ref>

After the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Dawlish was one of the Aurors who arrived with Cornelius Fudge into the [[Atrium|Ministry Atrium]]. Fudge sent Dawlish and [[Williamson]] down to the [[Department of Mysteries]] to see if there were, as Albus Dumbledore told him, escaped [[Death Eaters]] in the [[Death Chamber]], bound by an [[Anti-Disapparation Jinx]].<ref name="OP36">{{OOTP|B|36}}</ref>

===Second Wizarding War===

====Under Minister Rufus Scrimgeour====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you're not at Hogwarts.|Albus Dumbledore|Yes, he is very nosy about that. He has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn't kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.|Dawlish was ordered by the Minister to tail Dumbledore|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
When [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] succeeded [[Cornelius Fudge]] as [[Minister for Magic]] due to his failure to announce the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], Dawlish was overlooked as his successor as Head Auror and instead assigned to a task force of [[Auror]]s stationed in [[Hogsmeade]] to provide [[Hogwarts Castle]] with extra security, which also included [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Proudfoot]] and [[Savage]].<ref name="HBP8">{{HBP|B|8}}</ref>

Intrigued by [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s activities outside [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|his school]], [[Minister for Magic|Minister]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour|Scrimgeour]] assigned Dawlish to follow Dumbledore, only to be discovered and jinxed by the headmaster to stop his pursuit.<ref name="HBP17">{{HBP|B|17}}</ref>

In the summer of [[1997]], Dawlish was put into the [[Confundus Charm]] by someone in the [[Order of the Phoenix]], in order to provide the [[Death Eaters]] with a false trail as to when [[Harry Potter]] would depart from [[4 Privet Drive]]. Sure enough, [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]] extracted information from him, and he told him that he would be moved on [[30 July]], escorted by an entire party of [[Auror]]s. [[Severus Snape]], however, knew this was a false trail (even noting that Dawlish was especially susceptible to the Confundus Charm) and told Voldemort the [[Order of the Phoenix]] would move Harry on [[27 July]].<ref name="DH1">{{DH|B|1}}</ref>

====Under Minister Pius Thicknesse====
{{Quote|But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That's when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran... Thing was, they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn't need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway, Dawlish is still in St Mungo's and Gran's on the run.|Dawlish was no match for Augusta Longbottom|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
On [[1 August]], [[1997]] the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|taken over]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]]<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref> as [[Minister for Magic|Minister]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] was killed and replaced by [[Pius Thicknesse]], who was under the [[Imperius Curse]].<ref name="DH11">{{DH|B|11}}</ref> Following this event, the Aurors was decommissioned, and many of Dawlish's colleagues were [[wandless|stripped of their wands and jobs]].<ref name="DP 1997">See [[:File:Dp severus snape.jpg|this image]]</ref> while he himself were reassigned to the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]], in which capacity he was required to assist the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]-controlled Ministry with the capture of [[Muggle-born]]s for the purported crime of "stealing magic", as well as with transporting them to [[Azkaban]].<ref name="DH15">{{DH|B|15}}</ref>

Still under the effects of the [[Confundus Charm]], Dawlish was [[Stunning Spell|Stunned]] by [[Dirk Cresswell]] halfway on their flight to [[Azkaban]]. Cresswell was not sure if he was left alright, but took [[John Dawlish's broomstick|Dawlish's broomstick]] and went on the run.<ref name="DH15" />

When [[Neville Longbottom]] stepped over the line in rebelling against [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Dawlish was sent to take [[Augusta Longbottom]] as a hostage to get Neville to cooperate with the new regime. However, the Ministry had heavily underestimated Augusta, and she caused him sufficient injury to merit admittance into [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]].<ref name="DH29">{{DH|B|29}}</ref>

===Later life===
What happened to Dawlish after the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] is unknown. However, a [[Confundus Charm]] had been placed on John Dawlish the previous July, and he continued to act "not quite right" for some time thereafter, and unless there were sufficient evidence to implicate his guilt as having served Voldemort's Ministry of his own volition, it is possible that he was never charged with anything. Indeed, if his chosen career as a Dark Wizard catcher were any indication, it is safe to say that Dawlish was not a likely sympathiser of the Dark witches and wizards that had briefly risen to dominance of the wizarding community and presumably somehow coerced into helping them.

==Physical appearance==
Dawlish was described as looking very capable and self-assured, a "tough-looking wizard" with "very short, wiry" grey hair.<ref name="hair" /> When hesitant or unsure of himself, he would blink and look "rather foolish".<ref name="OP27" />

==Personality and traits==
A dedicated and hard-working individual already in his youth, John Dawlish was a man of diligence, as shown by the fact that he completed his magical education with top marks on all of his [[N.E.W.T.|N.E.W.T. exams]]<ref name="OP27" /> and successfully passed the highly demanding [[Auror recruitment programme|character and skill requirements]] needed to join the [[Auror Office]].<ref name="OOTP29" /> His conscientiousness in this regard was further reflected by how even [[Albus Dumbledore]], quite possibly the greatest wizard of all time, considered him to be an excellent [[Auror]].<ref name="OP27" /> He was shown to carry out his career duties diligently from his superiors.<ref name="OP272"/><ref name="OP31" />

As a general rule, however, in his capacity as an Auror, Dawlish was appeared to be tough-minded man of action who took his duties very seriously. His unflappability was particularly evident during the Ministry's attempt to arrest [[Albus Dumbledore]] in [[1996]], after the headmaster falsely confessed to having conspired against the Ministry and planned to use Hogwarts to rise an army to overthrow the Ministry: not only did he not hesitate to step forward to challenge him single-handedly on this occasion,<ref name="OP272"/> something not even [[Lord Voldemort]] wanted to do if it could be avoided,<ref name="pottercast" /> but showed no reluctance in pursuing after the Professor's escape when he believed it was still possible to catch him.<ref name="OP272">{{OOTP|B|27}}</ref> 

For all his good intentions in joining the ranks of the wizarding world's best defence against the practitioners of the [[Dark Arts]], however, it was nevertheless the case that John Dawlish ultimately owed his allegiance to a bureaucratic and corrupt institution whose directives frequently placed him in morally questionable situations. He dutifully assisted [[Dolores Umbridge]] with the arrest and forced removal of [[Rubeus Hagrid]], despite said professor having done nothing to warrant the unceremonious eviction from a place that had been his home since childhood.<ref name="OP31"/> And while he was originally stationed in [[Hogsmeade]] to provide extra security to Hogwarts following the discovery that Lord Voldemort had [[Return of Lord Voldemort|returned]] and at large once again, he was known to have briefly abandoned his post at the behest of [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] to spy on Albus Dumbledore, which led the latter to [[jinx]] him a second time in as many school years.<ref name="HBP17" />

While he was a wizard of skill, however, Dawlish was still vulnerable to attack from people who was aware of and knew how to exploit them: One such person was [[Albus Dumbledore]],<ref name="pottercast"/> who knew them well enough to effortlessly best him on at least two occasions, and allowed the [[Order of the Phoenix]] to take advantage of his susceptibility to the [[Confundus Charm]] to lay a false trail for the [[Death Eaters]] regarding the [[Battle of the Seven Potters|relocation]] of Harry Potter. Dawlish became the "favourite punching bag" of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] in the time that followed the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic]], to the point where, when he was sent to apprehend [[Augusta Longbottom]] as a way of trying to force her compliance, he got severely injured by the elderly witch and ended up in St Mungo's, underestimating her.<ref name="DH27">{{DH|B|27}}</ref> Dawlish was described as having been a bit punch-drunk and no longer firing on all cylinders when she hospitalised him.<ref name="pottercast" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': John Dawlish was a wizard of considerable ability, excelling in his studies and ultimately achieving an impressive academic record by earning top marks on all of his [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]]. Sometime after his graduation from Hogwarts, he went on to become an [[Auror]], which by all accounts served as a further testament of the fact that he was an unusually accomplished wizard, as only the best and brightest could ever have passed the highly demanding training programme. As an official [[Dark Wizard]] catcher, he was more than proficient in at least [[Potions (class)|Potions]], [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], [[Herbology]], and [[Charms (class)|Charms]],<ref name="OOTP29"/> as well as a very capable investigator [[Auror training|trained extensively]] in specialised areas such as [[Concealment and Disguise]] and [[Stealth and Tracking]].
*'''[[Auror]] skills''': By the mid-[[1990s]], Dawlish was regarded as an excellent Auror. Ultimately, he proved to be reputable enough to perform assignments of great responsibility: he served as bodyguard on at least one occasion to [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]], he was stationed in the village of [[Hogsmeade]] to guard [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from potential [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] attacks during the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]], and he was sent to tail [[Albus Dumbledore]] when he was under suspicion by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].
*'''[[Martial magic]]''': As a professional Dark Wizard catcher, Dawlish was well versed in offensive magic, but by the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]], a combination of unfamiliar situations, far superior opponents, sheer bad luck, and [[Confundus Charm]]s effectively meant that Dawlish was prevented from exercising the full extent of his skill. His two encounters with [[Albus Dumbledore]] aside, both of which predictably enough ended in him being easily defeated,<ref name="OP27"/><ref name="HBP17" /> the rest of his subsequent failures came about from various unforeseen factors rather than any actual ineptitude on Dawlish's part: during the attempted dismissal of [[Rubeus Hagrid]] from Hogwarts, the magical resistance that came with Hagrid being a [[Half-Giant]] made the task of forcibly evicting him from the ground without using deadly force significantly more difficult;<ref name="OP31"/> when he was knocked unconscious by [[Dirk Cresswell]] while he transporting the former to Azkaban, Cresswell himself attributed his escape to Dawlish having been [[Confundus Charm|Confunded]] beforehand; by the time he was sent to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] by [[Augusta Longbottom]], he had been the "favourite punching-bag" of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] for some time and was somewhat "punch-drunk", in addition to being often put under the effects of the [[Confundus Charm]].
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Dawlish was also shown be a competent [[broomstick]] flyer, as whilst working for the corrupt [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]], he transported falsely convicted [[Muggle-born]] individuals to the prison [[Azkaban]] via broomstick flight, meaning he was accomplished with this method of [[Magical transportation|wizarding transportation]].<ref name="DH15"/>

==Possessions==
*'''[[Wand]]''': Dawlish owned a wand, which was of unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. He used his wand in his career as an Auror.<ref name="OP27"/><ref name="OP31"/>
*'''[[John Dawlish's broomstick|Broomstick]]''': John Dawlish owned his own [[broomstick]], which was of an unknown make and brand, to transport Muggle-borns to Azkaban via broomstick flight. However, he was [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] and had his broomstick stolen from him by [[Dirk Cresswell]], who subsequently escaped and took it with him instead.<ref name="DH15"/>

==Etymology==
The name "John" is the English form of ''Iohannes'', the Latin form of the Greek name Ιωαννης (''Ioannes''), itself derived from the Hebrew name יוֹחָנָן (''Yochanan'') meaning "Yahweh is gracious".

"{{wplink|Dawlish}}" is the name of a seaside town in Devon. It's name comes from a nearby stream, once called "Deawlisc", meaning "devil [[water]]".

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Jo, ''[John Noe]'' idolises a man, an Auror, who got {{wplink|pwn}}d by an old lady wearing a dead bird on her head. You know, on her hat. Now, come on!|[[Sue Upton]] on John Noe's obsession with Dawlish.|J.K. Rowling PotterCast Interview}}
*Dawlish is portrayed in {{OOTP|FA}} by British actor [[Richard Leaf]].
*He was named after [[John Noe]], co-host of [[PotterCast]] after a friend of John's asked J. K. Rowling what Dawlish's first name was, and displayed an obsession with the character throughout the podcast.<ref name="pottercast" />
*In the video game adaptations of the Harry Potter series, there is a recurring [[Ravenclaw]] student by the name of [[Helen Dawlish]]. Given the unlikelihood of there being two unrelated families with the same name due to the relatively small size of the magical community in Britain, if Helen was a close relative of John's, such as a daughter or niece, her mandatory attendance at Hogwarts during the [[1997–1998 school year]] where she was at the mercy of the [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow|Carrows]] presumably played a part in his cooperation with the new regime.
*Dawlish's frequent injuries and incapacitations are somewhat of a running joke in the last three instalments of the series. His role is largely omitted in the [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]], and his appearances are diminished to two background appearances with no lines in {{OOTP|FA}}, and a brief mention in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|first part of the film adaptation]] of {{DH}}. [[J. K. Rowling]] stated that "there's no dishonour to Dawlish", as anyone would have been in trouble going up against Dumbledore and that he was "punch drunk" by the time that he faced Augusta Longbottom, who was nevertheless a powerful witch.<ref name="pottercast" />
*He was occasionally the subject of a joke saying that he would have some real significance in the last book. An example of this joke can be seen at the poll on [http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/ The Leaky Cauldron].
