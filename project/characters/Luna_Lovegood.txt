'''Luna Scamander'''<ref name="lastname">{{WU}} {{see image|File:Luna-Scamander-WU.jpg}}</ref><ref name="MA May"/> (née '''Lovegood''')''' '''(b. [[13 February]] [[1981]])<ref name="JKR-twitter-birthday" /> was a [[wizardkind|witch]] and the only child and daughter of [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]] and [[Pandora Lovegood]]. Her mother accidentally [[Death|died]] while experimenting with [[spell]]s when Luna was nine and thus Luna was raised by her father, editor of the magazine ''[[The Quibbler]]'', in a [[Lovegood House|rook-like house]] near the village of [[Ottery St Catchpole]] in [[Devon]]. 

Luna attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1992]]-[[1999]] and was sorted into [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]]. In her fourth year, Luna joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]], of which she became an important member. She participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] ([[1996]]) and the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] ([[1997]]), and co-led the reconstituted [[Dumbledore's Army]] when [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] fell under the control of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] with Severus Snape as headmaster. 

Because of her father's political dissidence at the time, Luna was abducted by [[Death Eaters]] to be held ransom, and imprisoned in the dungeons of [[Malfoy Manor]] for months. She was [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|freed]] by [[Dobby]] along with several other prisoners in the spring of [[1998]], and stayed at [[Shell Cottage]] until she returned to Hogwarts to participate in the [[Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]] of the [[Second Wizarding War]].

After the war, Luna became a [[Magizoologist]], discovering and classifying many magical species that had never been encountered before. She eventually married [[Rolf Scamander]], the grandson of [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], a famed Magizoologist, with whom she had twin sons, [[Lorcan and Lysander]]. Luna's good friends [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]] also named their daughter and third child [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]] in honour of her.

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1981–1992}}===
Luna was born on [[13 February]] [[1981]], the only child of [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]] and [[Pandora Lovegood]]. It is presumed that Luna had a nice family life based on her later attitude about her life. However, this was all changed when Pandora was accidentally killed while experimenting with a spell that she created when Luna was nine years old. Thus, Luna was subsequently raised by Xenophilius alone for the rest of her life. As she witnessed her mother's death, she was able to see [[Thestral]]s, the magical skeletal black horses that led the Hogwarts carriages, from that point onward.<ref name="OTP"/>

===Hogwarts years {{C|1992–1998}}===
====Early years====
{{Quote|Some people call me 'Loony' Lovegood, actually.|Hogwarts students' view of Luna|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Luna attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1992]] and was sorted into [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]]. One year behind the famous Harry Potter, she noticed [[Thestral]]s on her very first day of school, [[1 September]] [[1992]].

During her years at Hogwarts, she was often teased by many of the other students due to her strange behaviour and odd beliefs. Some time during her early years at Hogwarts students had also taken to calling her "Loony Lovegood". Luna also met and became a friend of [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who was in the same year as her. In the summer of [[1994]], she went to the [[Quidditch World Cup]] with her father.<ref name="GOF8">{{GOF|B|8}}</ref>

In her [[third year]] at Hogwarts, she chose [[Divination (class)|Divination]] as an elective, as in the [[1996–1997 school year]] [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] claimed to miss her in class; Luna explained she had [[Firenze]] that year.<ref name="HBP15">{{HBP|B|15}}</ref> She may also have attended [[Study of Ancient Runes]], as before the [[1995–1996 school year]], she was seen reading an article written about runes in ''[[The Quibbler]].''<ref name="OOTP10">{{OOTP|B|10}}</ref>

====Fourth year====
<!-- Don't change this to fifth, she's younger than Harry. -->{{Quote|There's room in this one, there's only Loony Lovegood in here — Don't be silly, she's all right.|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] introducing Luna to Nevile Longbottom|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-3530.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Luna meeting the [[trio]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] for the first time]]
In Luna's fourth year, she met and befriended [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Neville Longbottom]]. She also was one of the few who believed Harry's declaration that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was back. As the year progressed, she was invited to join an underground [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] group called [[Dumbledore's Army]], which was taught and led by Harry Potter. This organisation was to teach practical defence so that students could fend off Death Eaters. 

Luna eagerly accepted the request, working hard along with the others and enjoying their company. In an effort to make people believe Harry's story, Hermione arranged an interview for him with [[Rita Skeeter]] at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] — Luna accompanied them so as to persuade her father to publish the interview in ''[[The Quibbler]]''. The copy sold out, every Hogwarts student and possibly every professor as well, read the copy because of the Education Decree that stated that it was banned on school grounds.<ref name="OTP" />

[[File:Dean in d.a..jpg|250px|thumb|Luna standing next to [[Dean Thomas]] and [[Cho Chang]] during a [[Dumbledore's Army]] meeting]]
Near the end of the year, Harry had a vision that his godfather, [[Sirius Black]], was being tortured by Lord Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. Luna and Ginny stood guard while Harry and Hermione snuck into [[Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]'s office, to use the fireplace to try to contact Sirius, while Ron attempted to distract Umbridge. However, they were caught, along with Neville Longbottom, by Umbridge and members of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]]. They were restrained and gagged, but Luna hardly seemed bothered by this as she was staring, dreamily, through the window as if bored.<ref name="OTP" /> 

Harry and Hermione drew Umbridge away into the [[Forbidden Forest]], and Luna, Ginny, Ron, and Neville managed to escape from the Inquisitorial Squad using a variety of hexes and jinxes. When they all met up again in the forest, Harry planned to go to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Luna reminded Harry about the [[Thestral]]s and suggested using them to get to the Ministry. She then mounted her Thestral side-saddle, "as though she did this every day". She also helped Ron, Hermione and Ginny mount their Thestrals, as the animals were invisible to them. The six D.A. members flew to the Ministry and entered the [[Department of Mysteries]], where Luna heard voices coming from behind a [[Veil]], just as Harry did. The group was soon ambushed by twelve [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="OTP" />

{{Main|Battle of the Department of Mysteries}}
[[File:Tonks and Moody helping Luna escape GIF.gif|250px|thumb|left|Moody and Tonks helping Luna during the stand-off in the [[Death Chamber]]]]
Luna participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|battle]] that ensued. She mainly protected Ron, who had been hit with a [[Confundus Charm|spell]] that made him highly confused. Luna also attacked a Death Eater who had seized Ginny's ankle with the [[Reductor Curse]], which destroyed a model of the planet Pluto. The model blew up in the Death Eater's face; however, the impact broke Ginny's ankle. Luna then guided both the injured Ginny and the [[Confundus Charm|Confunded]] Ron until they met up with Harry and Neville. 

Luna was one of the last D.A. members to fall, eventually being [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by a Death Eater and thrown across the room. She regained focus just before the end of the battle and survived relatively unscathed. At the end of the school year, Luna spoke to Harry, who was mourning the murder of his godfather and had found no comfort in talking to [[ghost]]s. Luna told him about [[Pandora Lovegood|her mother]]'s death and her belief that she would see her again someday, and how Harry might be able to see his godfather again, which was a comforting thought to Harry.<ref name="OTP" />

That summer, Luna and [[Xenophilius Lovegood|her father]] went to [[Sweden]] using the money the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' paid them to reprint ''The Quibbler''<nowiki/>'s interview with Harry to see if they could catch a [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]].<ref name="OTP">{{OOTP}}</ref>

====Fifth year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a-b|Harry Potter|So have you had a good term?|Luna|Oh, it's been alright. A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day —|How would you like to come with me to [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]]'s party tonight?|Slughorn's party? With you?|Yeah, We're supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like... I mean... I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don't want to...|Oh no, I'd love to go with you as friends! Nobody's ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I dye mine too?|Discussion of Luna's school term|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Halfblood-00660.jpg|250px|thumb|Luna on the Hogwarts Express talking to Ginny Weasley and Dean Thomas]]
This year was Luna's [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] year. On her way to Hogwarts in the [[Hogwarts Express]], Luna shared a compartment with [[Harry Potter]] and she was accompanied by [[Neville Longbottom]]. Luna was holding another edition of the Quibbler, which she told Harry was going strong because of his interview. She then put on a brightly coloured pair of free "Spectrespecs" that were from inside the Quibbler. She was very disappointed to find out that the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] would not continue that year. When [[Romilda Vane]] asked Harry if he wanted to join her and her friends in another compartment, while treating Luna and Neville with disdain, Harry coldly rebuffed her, stating that they were his friends. Luna correctly observed that people expected Harry to associate with "cooler" people; he replied that she and Neville were cool, and among his closest and most trustworthy friends.<ref name="HBP" />

Towards Christmas, Luna comforted [[Hermione Granger]] after [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] mocked her in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] and Hermione ran into the girl's bathroom in tears. Luna had found Hermione crying and Harry had been looking for Hermione to return the books she left in Transfiguration class. After Hermione left, Harry asked Luna if she would like to go to Professor Slughorn's Christmas party with him, just as friends, and Luna excitedly accepted his invitation.<ref name="HBP" /> 

[[File:Slug Club party.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Luna as Harry's date at Slughorn's Christmas party]]
Luna wore a set of spangled silver robes that was attracting a certain amount of giggling from the onlookers, but she otherwise looked quite nice. While there, she conversed with multiple people, and took an interest in [[Sanguini]], a [[vampire]] guest. She also made Harry laugh so hard that mead came out of his nose when she discussed the [[Rotfang Conspiracy]] after [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] sneered at Harry's ambition to become an [[Auror]]. She continued the discussion of the Rotfang Conspiracy with [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], who seemed completely interested. Luna was also present when Draco Malfoy was caught out of bed after hours by Filch and dragged into the party to be punished.<ref name="HBP" />

Also that year, Luna would temporarily replace [[Zacharias Smith]] as [[Quidditch]] commentator for the school. Many found Luna's commentary amusing, as Luna forgot players' names and went off on tangents such as speculating that Smith, who was unable to maintain procession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from "[[Loser's Lurgy]]", or saying how a cloud was interestingly shaped. She never actually attempted reported the score, and [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] had to report it. However, after Ron heard this commentary, which he found highly amusing, he said "''you know, Luna's grown on me,''" when previously he found her very strange and slightly off-putting.<ref name="HBP" />

[[File:Ron, Luna, & Pomfrey raise wands.jpg|250px|thumb|Luna raising her wand after the death of Albus Dumbledore, along with Ron Weasley and [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]]]]
Luna once gave Harry a note from [[Albus Dumbledore]] telling him to come to his office for a private lesson. At the end of the school year, the castle came under attack by [[Death Eaters]], and Luna was one of the few D.A. members to participate in the ensuing [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], along with Neville, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], Ron, and Hermione. Harry asked her and Hermione to watch Snape's office, which they did, but Snape told them that Death Eaters were in the castle and that they had to look after [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], whom he claimed had collapsed. After taking [[Felix Felicis]] from Harry, the D.A. members were almost untouchable, and all survived the battle unscathed except Neville, who was injured but soon recovered. Luna helped him into his seat when they attended Albus Dumbledore's funeral at the end of the school year.<ref name="HBP">{{HBP}}</ref>

====Sixth year====
<!-- Don't change this to seventh, she's younger than Harry. -->{{Dialogue a-b-a|Harry Potter|The [[Lovegood family|Lovegoods]] are quite unusual.

[[File:Deathly Hallows - Harry, Luna and X Lovegood.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Luna and her father talking with Harry at [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|Bill and Fleur's wedding]]]]
On [[1 August]] [[1997]], Luna and her father attended the wedding of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] at the[[the Burrow| Burrow]]. Luna was able to instantly recognise [[Harry Potter]], who was disguised as a [[Weasley family|Weasley]] cousin by use of [[Polyjuice Potion]], by only his expression. She wore yellow robes, at her father's insistence, and had a sunflower in her hair. Her father believed that wearing sun colours to weddings brought luck. Luna sat at the same table as Harry, [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]]. At one point, while under the influence of gnome saliva, Luna started dancing by herself, twirling on the dance floor with her arms raised. This drew attention from a few onlookers, as it was a very bizarre sight.<ref name="DH" />

[[File:DH1 Death Eaters inside Hogwarts Express 02.jpg|250px|thumb|Death Eaters conducting a raid on the [[Hogwarts Express]] in an attempt to capture Harry Potter]]
That day, the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was taken over by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], so it was to a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]-controlled [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] that Luna returned for her sixth year. On 1 September, Death Eaters boarded the train in search of Harry Potter, but were unsuccessful in capturing him because he wasn't on board. [[Severus Snape]] had also been appointed headmaster and Death Eaters [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]] professors. Early in the year, Luna, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] attempted to steal the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] from the Headmaster's office, in an effort to help Harry. Snape caught them and sent them into the [[Forbidden Forest]] with [[Rubeus Hagrid]] as punishment. The three of them revived and led [[Dumbledore's Army]], which tried to sabotage the Death Eaters' control of the school and to help Harry, Ron and Hermione — who were off hunting down Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es — in any way they could.<ref name="DH" />

On her way home over the Christmas holidays, Death Eaters captured Luna because her father had been printing stories in support of Harry.<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

=====Capture and escape=====
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger |Where's Luna? Let's see what she thinks.|Ron Weasley |Cowardly old wart. Luna's got ten times his guts.|The trio visiting the Lovegood home|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:LunaandOllivander.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Ollivander and Luna held captive in the basement of [[Malfoy Manor]]]]
It was believed that Luna was held captive at [[Azkaban]], though she was actually imprisoned in the basement of [[Malfoy Manor]], along with the famed [[wandmaker]] [[Garrick Ollivander]], to whom she proved a great comfort. Her father was so desperate to get her back that he tried to turn Harry, Hermione, and Ron over to the Ministry in exchange for her freedom; the trio escaped, but Hermione ensured that the Death Eaters [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]] called glimpsed Harry as they left, so that neither he nor Luna would be punished. The [[Lovegood House|Lovegoods' home]] was largely destroyed with an erumpent horn, which Xenophilius had believed to be a [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]]'s, blew up inside. After the failed ambush Xeno was taken to Azkaban prison for the remainder of the war.<ref name="DH" />

{{Main|Skirmish at Malfoy Manor}}
[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hollows-p2-harry luna dobby.jpg|250px|thumb|Luna comforting Harry while he held a deceased Dobby]]
The prisoners in Malfoy Manor were soon joined by Harry, Ron, [[Dean Thomas]], and [[Griphook]] the goblin, while Hermione was [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] for information upstairs by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. After Luna helped cut the ropes off their new cell-mates, [[Dobby]] the [[house-elf]] came to free them. He took Luna, Dean and Ollivander to [[Shell Cottage]], the home of [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur Weasley]], and then returned to assist Harry, Hermione, Ron and Griphook in escaping the Manor. He died in rescuing them.<ref name="DH" /> 

Up until the Battle of Hogwarts, Luna stayed at the cottage for the remainder of the war, and when Dobby was buried, she closed the house-elf's eyes and provided the eulogy, thanking him for rescuing her. During her stay, she practised using a new wand that Ollivander had made for her. She also seemed to have started a friendship with Dean. It is unknown what Luna did after Harry, Ron and Hermione left Shell Cottage in order to [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)|break into]] [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], but she returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in May when Neville signalled her as to the trio's return. All of Dumbledore's Army was reassembled and prepared to fight.<ref name="DH" />

=====Battle of Hogwarts=====
{{Main|Battle of Hogwarts}}
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Luna|That's right. That's right, Harry ... come on, think of something happy ...|Harry Potter|Something happy?|We're all still here, we're still fighting. Come on, now ...|Luna encouraging Harry to perform the [[Patronus Charm]] during the battle|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Deathly-hallows-part2-still07.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry and Luna in [[Ravenclaw Tower]] looking for clues]]
When the trio asked the [[Ravenclaw]] [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members if they were familiar with an item that had once belonged to their house founder, Luna mentioned the [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|lost diadem]]. She took Harry to the Ravenclaw common room, answering the riddle, "''What came first, the Phoenix or the flame?''", with "''A circle has no beginning.''", in order to gain entrance, in order to show him a replica of the diadem. There, she stunned [[Alecto Carrow]], who was waiting for them per [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s orders. When given the choice, she joined the battle rather than evacuating with the younger students. She stood side-by-side with fellow D.A. members, students, as well as her professors and helped hold back Voldemort's army of Death Eaters and Dark creatures.<ref name="DH" />

It is unknown exactly what Luna did after accompanying Harry to Ravenclaw Tower. However, at one point she, [[Ernest Macmillan]], and [[Seamus Finnigan]] helped the trio drive off a group of [[Dementor]]s that attacked them by casting their [[Patronus Charm|Patronuses]]. Luna encouraged Harry to think of something happy, enabling him to summon his Patronus as well. It was Harry's Patronus that caused the Dementors to finally scatter. Luna and the others slipped back into the battle. She was present when Voldemort reported Harry supposed "death" and when Neville bravely stood up to Voldemort. It can be assumed that she was horrified when Neville was set on fire because of his defiance of the Dark Lord.<ref name="DH" />

[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|Luna witnessing Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort]]
Near the end of the battle, she fought against [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], alongside Hermione and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. When Bellatrix cast a [[Killing Curse]] at Ginny that missed by a mere milometer, [[Molly Weasley]] stepped in and killed her. Luna witnessed [[Harry Potter]]'s final defeat of Lord Voldemort and was among the first to congratulate him. A little while later, she created a diversion so that Harry could slip away from the victory celebrations with Ron and Hermione, and have a little break.<ref name="DH" />

===Later life {{C|1998–2014}}===

====Manticore investigation====
[[File:Luna, Hagrid and the player talking MA.png|250px|thumb|right|Luna talking with Hagrid and the student]]
In the [[2010–2011 school year]], Luna returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to assist [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in investigating the mysterious infestation of baby [[Manticore]]s within the school grounds. She brought a [[Luna Lovegood's suitcase|suitcase]] that contained magical creatures including a [[Hippogriff]] and several [[Thunderbird]]s, and released them when she opened it. She watched some students playing on the [[Hogwarts Quidditch pitch|Quidditch pitch]] with Hagrid and spotted the Manticores on the field, heading towards the [[Forbidden Forest]]. They were later joined by [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|one of the students]], who flew towards [[Hagrid's Hut]] on a [[Broomstick|broom]] and was forced to land early due to one of the Thunderbirds "sneezing" by creating a local thunderstorm. They conversed about the possibility of a Manticore mother existing somewhere on the grounds.<ref name="MA May">{{MA}} - [[May]] [[2022]] special event</ref>

[[File:Player and Luna encountering mother Manticore MA.png|250px|thumb|left|Luna and the student encountering the mother Manticore]]
Later, Luna went to the Forbidden Forest to investigate and was found by the student. [[Limbic mimicry|Imitating their walk]], they got near the baby Manticores and eventually arrived at a dark cave. The Manticore mother appeared in a clearing and attempted to attack them, and they defended themselves against her. After the student managed to temporarily restrain the Manticore using the [[Incarcerous Spell]], Luna grabbed them and [[Apparition|Apparated]] back to the edge of the forest where they were greeted by Hagrid.<ref name="MA May"/>

[[File:Luna, Hagrid and the player talking at dusk MA.png|250px|thumb|right|Luna entrusting the suitcase to Hagrid and the student]]
When Luna was preparing to leave Hogwarts, she left the suitcase in Hagrid's hands and they asked the student to help him with it. She recalled that [[Rolf Scamander|her husband]]'s grandfather, [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], had a [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|suitcase]] just like this one, which was filled with dozens of different environments designed for different creatures. This excited the student, and Luna encouraged them to be kind and respectful to the beasts within the suitcase so that they could offer much in return.<ref name="MA May"/>

====2014 Quidditch World Cup====
Luna and Rolf attended the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]] along with the rest of her friends in Dumbledore's Army. She wore robes made of the flags of all sixteen qualifying countries, but her twins were at home with their grandpa and did not come. At the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup final]], she sat in the VIP boxes with [[Dumbledore's Army]] and her husband, where he held her hands, which might have been because he was trying to prevent his wife from putting on one of her famous [[Special Event Hat]]s.<ref name="PMQuidditch">{{PM}} - [[2014 Quidditch World Cup final]] (Archived)</ref>

====The Calamity====
In [[2019]], she met [[Magizoologist|at least one]] of the members of the recently created [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]], whom she dazzled with her knowledge about the many ways in which magical creatures protect themselves.<ref name="WU">{{WU}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCIfSWgMX-c&t=8s see video])</ref> Luna also instructed them on how she performed the [[Stamina Charm]], which instantly improved their casting both when used on themselves and teammates and allowed them to accompany her in her search for [[Bowtruckle]]s and [[Thunderbird]]s to mentor them how to detect and look after them, improving their focus.

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|She had straggly, waist-length, dirty blonde hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look.|Description of Luna's physical appearance|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:Luna HPHBP.jpg|244x244px|thumb|Luna in her fifth year, age 15]]

In [[1995]], fourteen-year-old Luna had waist-length, straggly, dirty blonde hair,<ref name="hair" /> protuberant silvery eyes,<ref name="eyes" /> which often seemed to be dreamily distracted, and faint eyebrows. She had an aura of "distinct dottiness" about her,<ref name="OOTP10" /> and was known to put [[Luna Lovegood's wands|her wand]] behind her left ear for safekeeping.

Luna had a unique fashion sense that other people usually found bizarre. She often wore odd pieces of jewellery such as a [[Butterbeer]] cork necklace and [[Dirigible plum earrings]], and in 1996, a pair of [[Spectrespecs]].<ref name="HBP" /> Luna also did not wear shoes because students in her house would take her shoes and hide them.<ref name="OTP" />

At Hogwarts [[Quidditch]] matches, Luna supported [[Gryffindor]] against every House except [[Ravenclaw]]; to show her support for Gryffindor, she would wear a hat in the shape of a lion head that roars, and to show support for Ravenclaw she would wear an eagle hat with flapping wings.<ref name="OTP" /> At [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] in 1996, she wore spangled silver robes.<ref name="HBP" /> At [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s wedding, she wore bright yellow robes because she was taught it brought luck to a wedding to wear sun colours and had a sunflower in her hair, as well.<ref name="DH" /> She was described as "pretty" on some occasions, despite her odd clothes.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Luna was once again demonstrating her usual knack of speaking of uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her.|Luna's unusual character traits|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Harry-potter-and-the-half--blood-prince-Luna.jpg|282x282px|thumb|left|Luna's unusual appearance]]

Luna was an extremely quirky girl, with a serene disposition and many eccentric beliefs and qualities. She was a complete nonconformist; she lacked self-consciousness and was not afraid to show who she truly was. Luna was also intelligent and unusually perceptive, having been sorted into [[Ravenclaw]]<ref name="OTP" /> ''"where those of wit and learning will always find their kind.''" A prime example of Luna's perceptiveness was when she pointed out the ironically drastic measures taken against [[Sirius Black]] when he escaped Azkaban, but when ten Death Eaters (including [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]) escaped, barely any measures were taken to recapture them.

Although many thought Luna was bizarre, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, Dean Thomas and Ollivander eventually became very fond of her.<ref name="HBP" />

Luna's demeanour and voice were often distant and dreamy; she would drift away from a conversation she did not find interesting. However, whenever someone made fun of her father or his magazine ''[[The Quibbler]]'', the dreamy quality in her voice would vanish and be replaced by one of steel, and she would immediately become very angry. She had an uncanny way of making others uncomfortable by being bluntly honest — [[Harry Potter]] described her as having a "''knack for embarrassing honesty''". She was also completely unflappable and rarely seemed anxious or stressed, even under difficult circumstances such as being a prisoner of [[Malfoy Manor]]. Luna was very good at comforting others. She comforted Harry after [[Sirius Black|his godfather]]'s death<ref name="OTP" /> and [[Garrick Ollivander|Mr Ollivander]] while they were imprisoned together.<ref name="DH" />
[[File:Luna and Harry.gif|245px|thumb|Luna comforting Harry after the death of his godfather]]

Luna was often the subject of ridicule and had difficulty making friends. Other students gave her the nickname of "Loony Lovegood" and even stole and hid her things. She was unfazed by this, and instead chose to be nonjudgmental and accepting of those around her.<ref name="OTP" /> She once said that she did not like dancing much, though she did dance some at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding of Bill and Fleur]], along with her father. 

Luna seemed to have enjoyed artistic pursuits in her free time; her house was filled with various things that she painted.<ref name="DH" /> She even painted very life-like portraits of her friends that seemed to breathe. Luna was very loyal to the few friends she had — she published Rita Skeeter's interview of Harry Potter on ''The Quibbler'' (March issue, 1996)<ref>{{OOTP|B|26}}. Rita Skeeter interviewed Harry at the end of Chapter 25 (''The Beetle at Bay'').</ref> during the latter's fifth year and supported Harry even when he was outlawed by the Ministry of Magic. Ron stated that she certainly has far more courage than her father, who was at the time stressed when under duress. She also displayed admirable bravery during both the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and the Battle of Hogwarts.

===Luna's beliefs===
{{Quote|The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They're working from within to bring down the Ministry of Magic using a combination of Dark magic and gum disease.|Luna after [[Harry Potter]] discussed his wish to become an Auror|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

Luna believed in many things that few others do; given her inclination towards superstition, she would have probably liked [[Divination]]. However, as she grew older, she came to accept that some things simply do not exist.<ref name="blc" /><ref name="msnbc" /> 

[[File:06 Dobby rescuing Mr. Ollivander and Luna Lovegood.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Luna Lovegood addresses [[Dobby]] as "Sir" at the [[Malfoy Manor]]]]

She seemed to believe everything she read in ''[[The Quibbler]]'', mainly because her father wrote it. Some theories she believed in included: [[Sirius Black]] being [[Stubby Boardman]], that [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] was a [[vampire]], that the [[Auror]]s were part of the [[Rotfang Conspiracy]] to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using [[Dark Arts|Dark magic]] and gum disease, that the [[Tutshill Tornados]] were top of the league by a combination of bewitched brooms and torture, that [[Cornelius Fudge]] ordered [[goblin]]s to be made into pies, drowned, or assassinated in other various ways, had an army of [[Heliopath]]s, and used the [[Department of Mysteries]] to develop terrible poisons to feed to anyone who disagreed with him.

{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Luna|I still feel very sad about it sometimes. But I've still got Dad. And anyway, it's not as though I'll never see Mum again, is it?|Harry Potter|Er — isn't it?|Oh, come on.

You heard them.|Luna's perspective on her [[Pandora Lovegood|mother]]'s death, showing her belief in the [[Afterlife]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

Luna also believed in things that were proven true: Harry's story about [[Return of Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's return]], the voices beyond the [[veil]] and the belief that there were people behind it, and that [[Hufflepuff]] [[Chaser]] [[Zacharias Smith]] was suffering from [[Loser's Lurgy]]. Loser's Lurgy is not proven to exist, but it was true that when Smith lost in Quidditch he thus acted accordingly.

Some of the animals she believed in were: [[Moon Frog]]s, [[Blibbering Humdinger]]s, [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]]s, [[Heliopath]]s, [[Umgubular Slashkilter]]s, [[Nargle]]s, [[Aquavirius Maggot]]s, [[Wrackspurt]]s, [[Gulping Plimpy|Gulping Plimpies]], and [[Dabberblimp]]s.

She also believed in the fable of [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|Lost Diadem]], a crucial Ravenclaw item and a [[horcrux]], which turned out to be a turning point in Harry's battle against Voldemort.<ref name="DH" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
[[File:Patronus2.gif|250px|thumb|right|Luna conjuring a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] in the form of a hare at age fourteen]]
Luna was shown to be a very powerful and talented witch. At the age of fourteen, she was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus — a very advanced piece of magic and proof that she possessed superior magical ability.<ref name="PM">{{WW|patronus-charm}}</ref>

*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': As a committed member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], Luna learned how to cast numerous defensive and offensive spells under the instruction of [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="OTP"/> Luna demonstrated her excellent defensive abilities by fighting in both the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against numerous [[Death Eaters]], and surviving all of them. 
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Despite her young age, Luna was a very competent duellist. At the age of fifteen, she participated in and survived the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] with no more than a few minor injuries. She also emerged from the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] with no major injuries. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] she, [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] duelled against the notorious [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and emerged as one of the survivors.{{Quote|I've never Stunned anyone except in our DA lessons. That was noisier than I thought it would be.|Luna after having non-verbally stunned Alecto Carrow|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
*'''[[Charm]]s''': In her fourth year, Luna learned how to conjure a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] in the form of a [[hare]],<ref name="DH" /><ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/translation-evanna-lynch-interview-46573/ "Harry Latino Interview"] retrieved from [http://www.snitchseeker.com/ Snitch Seeker]</ref> which is an incredibly advanced, powerful and protective charm, as well as a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability and talent, showing her proficiency for charm-work. She could also cast simple charms such as the [[Locking Spell]], [[Reductor Curse]], [[Stunning Spell]], [[Levitation Charm]], [[Revelio Charm]] and [[Wand-Lighting Charm]] successfully without difficulty.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': In 1998, Luna wordlessly stunned the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Alecto Carrow]] with the [[Stunning Spell]], while inside Ravenclaw Tower.<ref name="DH" /> The fact that she could effectively cast it nonverbally is a testament of sorts to her skill, since non-verbal magic is highly difficult, [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level magic.
[[File:Thestrals WB F5 ThestralsHarryAndLunaInTheForest Illust 100615 Land.jpg|250px|thumb|Luna and Harry, looking at the [[Thestral]]s. Luna Lovegood associated very well with animals]]
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': She may have studied this subject at Hogwarts. As an adult Luna became a famous [[Magizoologist]], a wizarding naturalist. She discovered and classified many species that had never been encountered before.<ref name="blc" /> She was also shown to be very skilled at handling various [[magic]]al [[creature]]s, such as [[Thestral]]s, showing her proficiency in [[Magizoology]].
*'''[[Study of Ancient Runes]]''': In the [[July]]/[[August]] edition of ''[[The Quibbler]]'' in [[1995]], Luna was able to read that issue's segment written in Ancient [[rune]]s upside down, heavily implying she was able to understand and translate such runes. This also implies that she may have studied the subject at Hogwarts.<ref name="OOTP10">{{OOTP|B|10}}</ref>
*'''Creative intellect''': Luna was a very creative, artistic and witty witch. She invented a [[Luna Lovegood's lion-topped hat|lion-shaped hat]] that, with a tap of a wand, made a realistic roar, and she made a [[Luna Lovegood's eagle hat|flapping eagle hat]] of the same kind. She also painted on her bedroom's ceiling the portraits of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, and Neville Longbottom, woving them with a "chain" consisting of a single word, "''friends''", "''repeated a thousand of times in golden ink''",<ref>{{OOTP|B|21}}.</ref> and it is suggested that she painted birds, flowers and insects on the walls of the kitchen of her family house.<ref>{{OOTP|B|20}}.</ref> All of this show her impressive skills as an artist.
*'''Leadership skills''': At the age of sixteen, Luna co-led Dumbledore's Army along with her friends, Ginny and Neville. Their leadership was so efficient that she was abducted in an attempt to force the resistance to surrender, though she was ultimately rescued by Harry and Ron.

==Possessions==
[[File:Luna first wand.jpg|130px|thumb|Luna's first wand]]
*'''[[Luna Lovegood's wands|Wand]]''': Luna Lovegood's first wand was of unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. This wand she used through out her life as a Hogwarts student, until she was captured and her wand confiscated and broken by Death Eaters in the middle of her sixth year. Her second wand was of unknown length, wood, and core material as well. It was made by [[Garrick Ollivander]] in the spring of [[1998]] after his rescue from [[Malfoy Manor]].
[[File:Lion Lovegood.jpg|200px|thumb|Luna wearing her lion hat in support of Gryffindor]]
*'''[[Luna Lovegood's lion-topped hat|Lion hat]]''': Luna created this hat that had the appearance of an ordinary pointed hat topped with a fake stuffed lion. When she tapped the hat with her wand, it let out an extremely realistic roar. She wore it to show her support of [[Gryffindor]] whenever they played against the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]].
*'''[[Luna Lovegood's eagle hat|Eagle hat]]''': Luna wore this hat whenever the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]] played against the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. On top of the hat is what appears to be a living eagle, which flapped its wings.
*'''[[Luna Lovegood's dress robes|Dress robes]]''': Luna wore silver dress robes to the [[Slug Club Christmas party]] in 1996 when she was taken as a guest by Harry Potter. Luna also owned a pair of [[Luna Lovegood's yellow dress robes|yellow dress robes]] that she wore to the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding of Bill and Fleur]] in 1997.
*'''[[Luna Lovegood's beetle wing earrings|Beetle wing earrings]]''': This was one of the items on her lost possessions list. She, at first, had believed they were stolen and taken away by [[Nargle]]s, but then later realised it was just her classmates.
*'''[[Luna Lovegood's silver star earrings|Silver star earrings]]''': Luna wore these to the Slug Club Christmas Party in 1996, along with her silver dress robes.
*'''[[Dirigible plum earrings|Dirigible plum-shaped earrings]]''': Luna wore these earrings when she expressed her belief in Harry, during 1995. In 1998 Harry noticed a bush covered in exceptionally strange and orange, radish-like fruit called [[Dirigible plum]] and notes their striking resemblance to Luna's earrings.
*'''[[Luna Lovegood's hare bracelet|Hare bracelet]]''': This bracelet was owned by Luna. It was made of a golden material and adorned with a small hare penchant, similar to her [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]].
*'''Patterned shoes''': Luna has a pair of patterned Converse sneakers, with what looks likes strawberries on them. They were stolen by some other pupils and hidden, with the rest of her shoes. Luna had to walk around barefoot for most of the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]] because of this.
*'''[[Purple Quill]]''': Luna owned this quill during the [[1995–1996 school year]] before it was stolen by her classmates. It was produced from a feather of a woodpecker.
[[File:Luna Lovegood's Butterbeer Cork Necklace.jpg|209x209px|thumb|Luna's necklace]]
*'''[[Butterbeer cork necklace]]''': She often wore it during her school days, to keep away Nargles. Many of the students found this odd.
*'''[[Beetle ring]]''': Luna wore this ring in 1995 and possibly earlier.
*'''[[Bubble Bow Booster]]: '''Luna owned a kit that was still in its original packaging, but someone took it from her and hid it during the 1995-1996 school year.
*'''[[Sum-solving ink]]''': This was a type of ink that presumably helped solve mathematical problems. Luna owned a bottle of turquoise sum-solving ink, but someone took it from her and hid it during her fourth year.
*'''[[Dumbledore's Army coin]]''': Luna owned one of these coins as a member of Dumbledore's Army.
*'''''[[Easy Spells to Fool Muggles]]''''': Luna owned a copy of this book by [[Luca Caruso]] but, it was stolen from her sometime during the 1995-1996 school year.
[[File:Spectrespecs 02.jpg|215px|thumb|Spectrespecs]]
*'''[[Spectrespecs]]''': Luna owned and wore a pair of Spectrespecs on the [[Hogwarts Express|train]] ride to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in 1996. The spectrespecs were large and colourful and were given away free in an issue of [[The Quibbler]] in 1996.
*'''[[Luna Lovegood's suitcase|Suitcase]]''': Luna formerly owned a suitcase similar to her husband's [[Newton Scamander|grandfather]]'s that contained a [[Hippogriff]] and several [[Thunderbird]]s. In the [[2010–2011 school year]], she gave the suitcase to [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and an [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|unidentified Hogwarts student]].

==Relationships==
===Family===
[[File:XenophiliusLovegood.jpg|227x227px|thumb|left|Luna's father [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]]]]
{{Quote|They took my Luna because of what I've been writing. They took my Luna and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her back to me if I-If I help; I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave.|Xenophilius Lovegood talking to Harry, Ron, and Hermione|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
With the death of [[Pandora Lovegood|her mother]] when she was nine years old, Luna was raised solely by [[Xenophilius Lovegood|her father]]. Because of this, she was an only child and the two were very close. Xenophilius raised his daughter to share many of his unusual beliefs, and the two enjoyed going on holidays to look for creatures such as [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]]s in Sweden.<ref name="OTP" /> Luna believed anything her father wrote in [[The Quibbler]] magazine, and came to his defence when [[Hermione Granger]] claimed the magazine was "rubbish." 

When Luna was abducted by [[Death Eaters]] in [[1997]] to force Xenophilius to stop opposing the Voldemort-controlled [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in ''[[The Quibbler]]'', her father was beside himself. He was desperate to the point of ceasing his public support of [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ambush at the Lovegood House|attempting]] to turn him, Hermione Granger and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] over to the Death Eaters in exchange for Luna's safety. When he failed to do so, Xenophilius was arrested by [[Selwyn]] and [[Travers]].<ref name="DH" /> Luna would also eventually meet [[Rolf Scamander]], grandson of the famous [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] and his wife [[Porpentina Goldstein|Porpentina]]. Rolf would become her husband and the union would produce twins, [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]] and [[Lysander Scamander|Lysander]].

===Harry Potter===
[[File:Harry Potter.jpg|220x220px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], a close friend]] 
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Luna|People expect you to have cooler friends than us.|Harry Potter|You are cool. None of them were at the Ministry. They didn't [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|fight with me]].|That's a very nice thing to say.|Luna and Harry discuss their friendship in [[1996]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
When Harry Potter first met Luna in 1995, he found her rather odd, but was grateful that she was one of the few people to believe his story that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned, and sympathised with the loss of her mother and her status as an outcast. After the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, they discussed the death of [[Sirius Black]] and the possibility of an afterlife. Harry "''found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly.''"<ref name="OTP" />

At the beginning of the next school year, he reacted coldly when [[Romilda Vane]] implied that Luna and [[Neville Longbottom]] were not worth spending time with; a contrast to the previous year, when he felt slightly embarrassed that his crush [[Cho Chang]] saw him in Luna's company. In [[1996]], Harry asked Luna to attend [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] with him as friends after reflecting on how "''he had never met anyone quite like her.''"<ref name="HBP" /> Harry was one of the portraits of her friends that Luna painted and hung on her bedroom ceiling, to which, upon Harry's discovery in the last book during his Horcrux-seeking journey, made him feel "''a great rush of affection"'' towards her.
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Luna|I'd want some peace and quiet, if it were me.|Harry Potter|I'd love some.|I'll distract them all. Use your cloak. Oooh, look, a [[Blibbering Humdinger]]!|Luna creates a diversion for Harry after the battle, so he could rest|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
When Harry took [[Polyjuice Potion]] to look like Barny at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour]], she recognised him from the expression on his face, hinting again at the closeness of their friendship, as she was not fooled for a minute by his disguise. Shortly before going to sacrifice himself during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Harry noted that Luna was among his closest friends, whom he had hoped to see one last time before his death. After Voldemort's defeat at Harry's hands, Luna sensed that Harry wanted to get away from the victory celebrations, and created a distraction so that he could slip away with Ron and Hermione.<ref name="DH" />

Later in life, Harry and Luna would remain close friends. He and Ginny even gave their [[Lily L. Potter|daughter]] the middle name "Luna" in honour of her. It's also quite possible that Harry became friends with her husband ([[Rolf Scamander]]) and close to her twins, [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]] and [[Lysander Scamander|Lysander]].

===Hermione Granger===
[[File:Hermione Granger.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|[[Hermione Granger]], a close friend]]
{{Quote|Luna has told me all about you, young lady. You are, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited, narrow, close-minded.|[[Xenophilius Lovegood]] on what Luna has told him about Hermione|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Luna and Hermione Granger did not have an ideal first meeting, as Hermione called ''[[The Quibbler]] ''"rubbish" without knowing that Luna's father was the editor. She was initially frustrated with Luna's belief in all manner of things without logical grounds or proof. However, she invited Luna to [[Dumbledore's Army]] and the two became friends. Hermione's opinion of Luna particularly seemed to improve after Luna proved her loyalty and bravery by participating in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], as she simply accepted that she and Luna had very different world views.<ref name="OTP" /> The following school year, Luna comforted Hermione over her fight with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] when she ended up crying in the bathroom at one point.<ref name="HBP" />

At [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]], Hermione tried to kick Ron for teasing Luna, and later defended her again from the insults of the portrait of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]]. Hermione was among the portraits Luna painted on her bedroom ceiling, circled by the words "friends." When [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Luna's father]] attempted to turn Harry, Ron and Hermione over to [[Death Eaters]] in exchange for his daughter's safety in [[1998]], Hermione engineered their escape so that the Death Eaters saw Harry briefly, thus ensuring that both Luna and her father were not harmed.<ref name="DH" />

Luna and Hermione also fought at the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where she, Seamus Finnigan, and [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] saved Hermione, Harry and Ron from Dementors. During the final stage of the battle, Luna, Hermione, and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] fought together against [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s most powerful [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. Hermione and Luna both survived the war, and it can be presumed that the pair remained very good friends during adulthood as well. Luna may be one of the best female friends of Hermione (along with Ginny), as she was only seen with these girls during her school-time at Hogwarts.

===Ron Weasley===
[[File:Ron Weasley.jpg|220x220px|thumb|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], a close friend]]
{{Quote|He says very funny things sometimes, doesn't he? But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.|Luna regarding Ron Weasley in [[1996]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
At the beginning of their acquaintance, Ron Weasley thought Luna was weird and was not particularly interested in knowing her, even occasionally referring to her as "Loony." Luna, on the other hand, seemed to find Ron very funny but rather insensitive in his relationships at times. Ron eventually grew fonder of Luna, marking her as his good friend, after getting to know her better through [[Dumbledore's Army]] and her being one of the only D.A. members to come to the trio's assistance when they tried to save [[Sirius Black]], during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].<ref name="OTP" />

He was particularly amused by her [[Quidditch]] commentary in [[1996]]<ref name="HBP" /> and thought highly of her bravery. When she attended his brother Bill's wedding, Ron was further amused by her behaviour and remarked that she gave "good value." However, Ron was still prone to tease Luna and scoff at her unusual beliefs at times.<ref name="DH" /> Ron and Luna also fought at the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where she, [[Seamus Finnigan]] and Ernie Macmillan saved Ron, Harry and Hermione from Dementors. Ron and Luna both survived the war, and the good friends remained in contact in adulthood.

===Ginny Weasley===
[[File:Ginny Weasley.jpg|219x219px|thumb|left|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], her good friend]]
{{Quote|I do like her, she's very nice.|Luna Lovegood's opinion of Ginny Weasley|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Luna and Ginny Weasley were in the same year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], though in different houses; Ginny was in Gryffindor whereas Luna was in Ravenclaw. Ginny seemed to find Luna rather peculiar, as she first referred to Luna as "Loony Lovegood" (though in an affectionate way). The two were very friendly, as Ginny led [[Harry Potter]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] into her train compartment in [[1995]], conversing politely with her.<ref name="OTP" />

Luna became one of Ginny's best friends through [[Dumbledore's Army]], and Ginny began telling others not to call Luna "Loony," prompting Luna to randomly state during her [[Quidditch]] commentary that Ginny was nice and she liked her.<ref name="HBP" /> Along with Neville, Luna and Ginny led the re-formed Dumbledore's Army while Hogwarts was under Voldemort's control.<ref name="DH" /> Ginny was also one of the five portraits — along with Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and Neville — that Luna painted and hung from her bedroom ceiling, with the word "friends" joining them together in gold writing.

Ginny and Harry Potter named [[Lily L. Potter|their daughter]] after Luna, considering Luna is a "dear friend." Luna may be one of the best female friends of Ginny (along with Hermione), as she was only seen with these girls during her school-time at Hogwarts. Indeed, Ginny insisted Luna to guide Harry into [[Ravenclaw Tower]] over [[Cho Chang]], confidently trusting her to not incite any clash of romance as Cho might have.

===Neville Longbottom===
[[File:Neville Longbottom.jpg|233x233px|thumb|Neville Longbottom, a very close friend]]
{{Dialogue a-b-c|Luna Lovegood|And I don't know who you are.|Neville|I'm nobody.|Ginny Weasley|No, you're not. Neville Longbottom — Luna Lovegood...|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] introduces Neville and Luna|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Luna and [[Neville Longbottom]], a Gryffindor student, first met on the Hogwarts Express, in 1995. Neville found Luna a bit "odd," as she believed in the existence of strange, mythical creatures, had a tendency to read magazines upside down, and wore earrings that appeared to be made of radishes. Luna, like Harry and Neville, had the ability to see Thestrals, as they had all seen someone die. Neville fought alongside Luna at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of Hogwarts. 

At some point, they became very close friends. During Luna's sixth year at Hogwarts, she, Neville and Ginny, re-formed and co-led Dumbledore's Army in order to oppose the Carrows.

===Dumbledore's Army===
[[File:Dumbledore's_Army.jpg|240x240px|thumb|left|[[Dumbledore's Army]]]]
{{Quote|I enjoyed the [[Dumbledore's Army|meetings]] too,... it was like having friends.|Luna regarding the D.A.|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
After they were both [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|rescued from Malfoy Manor]] in [[1998]], Luna and [[Dean Thomas]] seemed to grow close while staying at [[Shell Cottage]]. Dean still seemed rather bemused at some of the odd things Luna said at times, but did not ridicule her and was seen helping her in the [[Room of Requirement]] just before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name="DH" /> Luna also grew close with many of the other D.A. members, such as [[Seamus Finnigan]] and Ernie Macmillan, who she was seen fighting alongside during the Battle of Hogwarts.

Luna had met other members of Dumbledore's Army; there were [[Padma Patil]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Michael Corner]], and [[Marietta Edgecombe]] from [[Ravenclaw|her house]] (all of them fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], except Marietta), [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Susan Bones]], and [[Zacharias Smith]] from [[Hufflepuff]] (it is possible that all of them fought at the Battle of Hogwarts, except Zacharias), and [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Katie Bell]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Lee Jordan]], [[Parvati Patil]], Padma's twin sister and [[Colin and Dennis Creevey]] from Gryffindor. Fred, Lavender and Colin were killed at the Battle of Hogwarts. While most of the Other D.A. Members, (with the exception of Marietta) are unknown following the Battle of Hogwarts.

===Other friendships===
[[File:Dobby.jpg|208x208px|thumb|[[Dobby]], her friend]]
{{Quote|Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It's so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and so brave. I'll always remember what you did for us. I hope you're happy now.|Luna's eulogy at Dobby's funeral|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Luna liked Dobby the [[house-elf]], who came to rescue her from [[Malfoy Manor]]. After Dobby was killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], Luna closed his eyes, to make him "''seem like he was sleeping''." She also said a few words to Dobby during his [[Funeral of Dobby|funeral]]. 

Luna had also met [[Garrick Ollivander]], the wandmaker, at the [[Malfoy Manor]], where they were both imprisoned. She comforted Ollivander, and gave him courage. After they both escaped, Ollivander, who had grown quite fond of Luna, made her a new wand. She also met [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] when she stayed for a few weeks at their house, [[Shell Cottage]]. She left Shell Cottage when she, Dean, Bill and Fleur went to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. 

Luna thought [[Rubeus Hagrid]] was a poor teacher, saying that the students in Ravenclaw thought him to be a bit of a joke, and that she preferred Professor Grubbly-Plank. It is possible this opinion started to change during Umbridge's control of Hogwarts, as they were both against Umbridge and Luna credited Hagrid's teaching of [[Thestral]]s, which allowed them to go to the Ministry of Magic when they believed [[Sirius Black]] was in danger. During the [[1997–1998 school year]], Luna and Hagrid both acted in opposition to the Death Eaters' regime at Hogwarts, and Luna, along with Ginny and Neville, once served detention with Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest when they were caught by Snape.

==Etymology==
*Luna means "Moon" in Latin (as well as in Italian, Russian, Spanish, Bulgarian and Romanian). People believed that the moon caused craziness, which may be why she's the way she is. Her nickname, "Loony", also references the moon and its ties with insanity, as it is short for "lunatic".
*''Lovegood'' is a real surname and a compound word (Love and Good). Speaking in accordance of her having good feelings for every person she knew, hence Lovegood.
*Luna Lovegood is also alliterative, for effect.

*Luna is the only one of Harry's close school friends who is not a fellow Gryffindor.
*Harry names his daughter, Lily Luna, after her. Luna is the only person still living to give their name to one of Harry's children.
*The [[Dirigible plum earrings]] Luna wears in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' were made by [[Evanna Lynch]] herself, as was a [[Luna Lovegood's hare bracelet|bracelet]] she wore (in the shape of Luna's patronus) in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, it is [[Hermione Granger]] who introduces Luna to her friends, instead of [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], though the books imply that Hermione had never met Luna before.
*Luna was the last person in the books known to commentate a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Quidditch]] match. It is unknown if she commented during the final match during [[Harry Potter]]'s sixth year.
*In {{HBP}}, [[Nymphadora Tonks]] rescues Harry from the [[Hogwarts Express]] after [[Draco Malfoy]] uses the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] on him. However, in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film version]], Luna is the one who rescues Harry, by using her [[spectrespecs]] to see the [[Wrackspurt]] buzzing around his head, alerting her to his presence under the [[Cloak of Invisibility|cloak]].
*In {{HBP}}, Hermione points out that Harry put something in Ron's drink before the Quidditch match, but in the film version, it is Luna who notices, thinking it is a tonic.
*According to {{HBP|FA}} Luna sleepwalks at night and says because of that she wears shoes to bed.
*It was rumoured that Severus Snape was Luna's father and that Luna and Neville Longbottom were going to end up together at the end of ''Deathly Hallows''. Both these rumours were false. However, in the film adaptation of {{DH|F2}}, [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] confesses to [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] that he is crazy for Luna. They are later seen sitting beside each other in the infirmary. However, [[Matthew Lewis]] has said that this is merely a "summer fling" before Neville marries [[Hannah Abbott]] and Luna marries [[Rolf Scamander]].<ref>http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/audio-harry-potter-cast-and-crew-at-deathly-hallows-part-2-nyc-press-conference-82597/</ref>.
*Luna and fellow [[Dumbledore's Army]] member, [[Neville Longbottom]], both have compound last names. Love and good for Luna, and long and bottom for Neville.
*In {{DH|F2}}, Luna seems to have an intimate friendship with [[Helena Ravenclaw]], who knew the location of the diadem of Ravenclaw.
*[[Evanna Lynch]], who plays Luna Lovegood in the film series, named her cats after Harry Potter characters: she has a cat named Luna and another named [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. She also had a cat named [[Crookshanks]], although it is now deceased.
*In a deleted scene from {{DH|F2}}, Luna leaves [[Shell Cottage]] to return to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Harry tells her that it is not the same, to which Luna replies: "Neither am I."<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfsZaXNMLjE</ref> This is a reference to Luna's more mature and realistic worldview following the war.
*[[Scarlett Byrne]] auditioned to play Luna,<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DwCGd-xpd0</ref> as did the famous Irish actress [[wikipedia: Saoirse Ronan|Saoirse Ronan]],<ref>.http://www.irishcentral.com/ent/Saoirse-Ronan-admits-disappointment-over-Harry-Potter-Luna-Lovegood-role-126725153.html</ref> and ''[[wikipedia: The Dark Knight Rises|The Dark Knight Rises]]'' star [[wikipedia: Juno Temple|Juno Temple]].<ref>http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/10/juno_temple.html</ref>
*Evanna recently portrayed Luna again for one of [[Jessie Cave]]'s Pindippy videos.
*In the film adaptation of {{DH|F2}}, Luna did not show the [[Ravenclaw Tower#Ravenclaw Common Room|Ravenclaw Common Room]] but instead shouted at [[Harry Potter]] because of his reluctance of listening to her attempts of her approach about finding [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem]].
*A variant of Luna is available in the "Downloadable Character Pack" [[Wikipedia:Downloadable content|DLC]] for {{LEGO|Y2}}. The variant is called "Luna (Lion Head)" because it portrays Luna wearing her [[Luna Lovegood's lion-topped hat|lion hat]].
*In Part 2 of the final film, Luna is not seen duelling [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] alongside [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] but can be seen duelling two Death Eaters alongside an unidentified student behind Bellatrix during her duel with [[Molly Weasley]].
*IGN listed Luna Lovegood as their 12th top ''Harry Potter'' character, saying that loony-ness made her a "delight".<ref>[http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/07/12/top-25-harry-potter-characters?page=3 IGN,Top 25 Harry Potter Characters]</ref>
*Empire Magazine listed Luna as their 10th favourite Harry Potter character in "The 25 Greatest Harry Potter Characters".<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/features/greatest-harry-potter-characters/16.asp Empire, The 25 Greatest Harry Potter Characters]</ref>
*In the early drafts, Luna's name was "Lily Moon," until [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] changed it.
*Luna is the only known member of the Lovegood family whose first name is not of Greek origin, rather it is of Latin origin.
*[[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] originally intended Luna and Neville to end up together. In an interview with USA Today, she stated that she "started to feel a bit of a pull between them" but added that if they were together by the end it would have "felt too neat". Additionally, she stated that "Neville would always find Luna's wilder flights of fancy alarming, despite their close friendship."<ref>
https://www.pottermore.com/features/things-you-may-not-have-noticed-about-luna-lovegood</ref>
*Evanna Lynch has stated that she considers Luna to be a [[Wikipedia:Vegetarianism|vegetarian]], as it is her belief that Luna would not [[Wikipedia:Vegetarianism#Treatment of animals|feel morally right eating animals who have suffered]].<ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/evanna-lynch-talks-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-gringotts-ride-projects-veganism-100060/ Video: Evanna Lynch talks Wizarding World of Harry Potter Gringotts ride, projects, veganism] at SnitchSeeker.com</ref> However, Luna has eaten meat dishes in the books, such as [[Gulping Plimpy]] soup.
*Rowling has stated that she could imagine Luna as a [[Wicca]]n, but felt that the notion of Wicca was too different from wizardry as presented in ''[[Harry Potter (book series)|Harry Potter]]'' for them to coexist.<ref>[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/545128335379283968 .@GredxForgex Me too!  But it's a different concept of magic to the one laid out in the books, so I don't really see how they can co-exist.]</ref>
===Author's comments===
[[J. K. Rowling]] has said that the character of Luna took her by surprise, but that she was very fun to write, and contrasted her with [[Hermione Granger]]: "''She's slightly out of step in many ways but she's the anti-Hermione. Hermione's so logical and inflexible in so many ways and Luna is likely to believe ten impossible things before breakfast.''"<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0626-alberthall-fry.htm 26 June 2003 J.K. Rowling at the Royal Albert Hall]</ref> Rowling has named Luna as one of her favourite characters.<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=8 F.A.Q.: Favourite Characters] at {{JKRS}}</ref> Together with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Draco, Luna is part of the "big seven" characters that Rowling considers to be the most major characters in the series.<ref name="rowlingtalksdeathly2">[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/video-j-k-rowling-talks-deathly-hallows-part-2-film-production-lead-characters-82483/ SnitchSeeker - J.K.

[[J. K. Rowling]]'s favourite character was [[Luna Lovegood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA_QYZBWQ88/ J.K. Rowling 2012 Interview – Harry Potter: Beyond the Page]</ref>

===Luna in the films===
[[File:Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) HP5 screenshot.JPG|150px|thumb|Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood]]
[[Evanna Lynch]] plays Luna in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], and since Evanna is [[Ireland|Irish]], Luna has a slight touch of an Irish accent. In the films, Harry meets her at the school carriages where she is introduced by Hermione instead of Ginny. Luna's [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] is revealed to be a Hare, this is later confirmed to be canon in {{DH}}. Luna is seen barefoot throughout the film because students had stolen her shoes. In addition, Luna seems to have a taste for pudding and introduces Harry to the [[Thestral]]s; she offers a young Thestral an apple, which was turned down, before offering it a bit of raw meat with an accepting smile.

She also skipped around the school. Her [[butterbeer]] cork necklace has only one cork, which she says is to repel [[Nargle]]s. She also wears a beetle ring. During the battle at the Ministry, instead of being knocked unconscious, she was hit in the mouth by a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] before using an unusual verbally-incanted version of ''[[Dangling Jinx|Levicorpus]]'' to hurl her attacker away. When Ginny disintegrates the prophecy shelves with a [[Reductor Curse]], Luna is so distracted by the light that she does not run away, but Neville saves her. She is then taken hostage along with all of Harry's companions but is rescued by the appearance of the Order of the Phoenix members (Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Kingsley, and Mad Eye).

In {{HBP|FA}}, she states that she often sleep-walks at night and wears her shoes to bed just in case.
Lynch was a huge fan of the series before she was cast.

===Luna in the games===
[[File:LEGO Luna.jpg|150px|thumb|Luna as a LEGO minifigure]]
Luna's role in the game is much the same as her role in the film, though we do not meet her until Harry goes to find the people who signed up for the D.A. to tell them about the [[Room of Requirement]]. The Player has to help Luna feed the Thestrals, and then she will appear in the Room of Requirement. Later in the game, [[Fred and George Weasley]] send Luna to tell Harry how to swamp the clock tower courtyard, with one of their [[Portable Swamp]]s. At the end of the game, the player must help Luna find her missing objects, which are: a jumper, a newspaper, a lion mask, a pair of pink shoes, and her purse. Luna is also a playable character in the HBP game. She is a two-player [[duelling]] character and is unlocked (with Draco Malfoy) by retrieving two crests.
