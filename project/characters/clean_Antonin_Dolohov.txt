'''Antonin Dolohov''' was a [[Dark Wizard]] and one of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]]. Dolohov was considered a powerful [[Wizardkind|wizard]].

He fought in the [[First Wizarding War]], during which he tortured many [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], and [[wizardkind|wizards and witches]] who were not supporters of the Dark Lord. Along with four other [[Death Eaters]], he participated in the murders of [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]]. Dolohov was caught, convicted of these crimes, and sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]].

He escaped from prison after Voldemort's [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] during the [[Azkaban escapes#1996|mass break-out]] of [[1996]], and participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], where he was re-captured and [[Incarceration|incarcerated]]. By the summer of [[1997]], Dolohov was at large again. He and [[Thorfinn Rowle]] attacked [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] at [[Tottenham Court Road]], but they were defeated and his memory was wiped.

In [[1998]], Dolohov fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], during which he murdered [[Remus Lupin]]. At the climax of the battle, he engaged [[Filius Flitwick]] in a duel and was defeated.



In [[1970]], Dolohov's master began open hostilities against the rest of the [[wizarding world]], beginning the [[First Wizarding War]].

According to [[Igor Karkaroff]], Dolohov was among the most important Death Eaters and tortured many [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and non-supporters of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]. He murdered [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], the brothers of [[Molly Weasley]] (née [[Prewett family|Prewett]]). He was not the only participant in the act, though, since "[[Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye" Moody]] informed [[Harry Potter]] years later that it took five Death Eaters to kill the two wizards, whose murders were described as "brutal."


Imprisonment

In the year before the fall of Voldemort on [[31 October]] [[1981]], Dolohov was captured and sent to [[Azkaban]] for his crimes. His name was the first one that [[Igor Karkaroff]] revealed to the [[Council of Magical Law]] in an attempt to get himself freed from Azkaban, only to be informed that Dolohov had been captured around the same time as him. Dolohov then spent the next 14 years in his maximum security cell surrounded by Dementors. His cell was close to that of Bellatrix Lestrange's.


Early in [[1996]], Dolohov, along with the [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]] and several other [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] convicts, [[Azkaban escapes#1996|escaped Azkaban]] and rejoined Voldemort. It was speculated in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' that the escape was aided by [[Sirius Black]], but that was refuted in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].

Battle of the Department of Mysteries



On [[18 June]] [[1996]] [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] lured Harry Potter to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] precipitating the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. During the battle, Dolohov was paired with [[Jugson]] as the [[Death Eaters]] searched for the five students who had come to the Ministry with Harry Potter. They tracked [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Neville Longbottom]] to a room off the [[Time Room]], hitting the three of them with [[Impediment Jinx]]es. When Dolohov began to alert the other Death Eaters as to their location, Hermione used [[Silencing Charm]] on him to prevent it. 

He retaliated with an [[Antonin Dolohov's curse|unnamed curse]] which, despite being weaker than normal, because it was cast [[nonverbal spell|non-verbally]], severely injured Hermione. With a kick, Dolohov broke Neville's wand and nose and then cornered Harry, wordlessly threatening him. However, he was momentarily distracted, giving Harry the chance to [[Full Body-Bind Curse|Body-Bind]] him.

Before several [[Order of the Phoenix]] members arrived, Dolohov recovered, and he was able to defeat [[Alastor Moody]] in a duel. He placed [[Neville Longbottom]] under [[Dancing Feet Spell]] and attacked Harry with the same spell he used on Hermione, but most of the harm was blocked by Harry's [[Shield Charm]]. Then he tried used [[Summoning Charm]] on the [[prophecy]] in Harry's hand, but he was pushed by [[Sirius Black]]. He duelled Black where he seemed to get the upper hand but was again incapacitated by Harry with Body-Bind before he could hit Sirius with his signature spell.

Presumably, Dolohov was captured in the aftermath of the battle by [[Auror]]s and returned to [[Azkaban]].

Death Eater plans
, during the height of the Second Wizarding War]]
In [[July]] of [[1997]], Dolohov was again at large following another [[Azkaban escapes#1997|Azkaban break-out]]. He attended the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] meeting at [[Malfoy Manor]] that summer and was seated between [[Corban Yaxley]] and [[Severus Snape]]. He was also impressed when Yaxley announced that he had placed [[Pius Thicknesse]], the head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], under the [[Imperius Curse]]. He along with other Death Eaters, laughed when [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] insulted [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and the Malfoy family, regarding [[Nymphadora Tonks]] marrying werewolf [[Remus Lupin]].

Luchino Caffe Duel


 before attacking the trio in a [[Tottenham Court Road]] café]]
Shortly after the Death Eaters took over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and placed the [[Taboo|Taboo curse]] on Voldemort's name, Dolohov and [[Thorfinn Rowle]] tracked the trio to a [[Luchino Caffe|café]] on Tottenham Court Road. Harry noticed their presence right away, including them reaching for their wands and mirrored the movement. The duel that followed was short but fierce. During the skirmish that ensued, Dolohov nonverbally bound [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] with [[Incarcerous Spell|conjured ropes]] and slammed an invisible Harry Potter into a wall with ''[[Expulso Curse|Expulso]]'', but just before Harry dropped his wand, Hermione Granger hit Dolohov with a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]]. Dolohov's and Rowle's memories were then [[Memory Charm|modified]] by Hermione shortly after.


This spell seemed to work well enough at the time, but it actually had not been very effective, as the three friends found out later when Harry had a vision of Voldemort forcing [[Draco Malfoy]] to torture Rowle; it is implied that Dolohov was subjected to the same punishment for their failure (and possibly also for summoning Voldemort unnecessarily when he was occupied with his search for the [[Elder Wand]]) by being subjected to the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. 

Dolohov may have been among the Death Eaters assigned to keep an eye out for [[12 Grimmauld Place]], former headquarters of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and temporary hide-out for Harry, Ron and Hermione, as one of the Death Eaters mentioned watching the gap between houses 11 and 13 on the first of September was "the man with the twisted face", a characteristic often used to identify Dolohov. The [[Death Eaters]] were able to find out Harry, Ron and Hermione's location because Lord Voldemort's name was [[Taboo]]ed.

Battle of Hogwarts

During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on [[2 May]] [[1998]], Dolohov was seen fighting against [[Dean Thomas]] and [[Parvati Patil]]; Parvati shot a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] at him in defence of Dean. Dolohov also murdered [[Remus Lupin]] in a duel. The nature of Remus's death was not revealed, but his body was peaceful-looking, suggesting that Dolohov used the [[Killing Curse]] or [[Antonin Dolohov's Curse|his own curse]], as neither left visible marks. After [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] called a retreat and gave [[Harry Potter]] one hour to turn himself over, Dolohov and Yaxley stood guard in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. Harry followed them to the Death Eater camp to confront Voldemort. When the battle later resumed, Dolohov was defeated by [[Filius Flitwick]], a former duelling champion.

His fate following the battle is unknown, though it is possible that he was killed by Flitwick. It is also possible that he was sent back to [[Azkaban]], if he survived, like other Death Eaters.



Dolohov was described as having a "''long, pale, twisted face''" and as "burly", although not as large as the "huge" [[Thorfinn Rowle]]. He had also dark hair. As a Death Eater, he bore the [[Dark Mark]] on his left inner forearm.


Dolohov was extremely loyal to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and was a merciless Death Eater willing to commit various atrocities without hesitation or regret. He showed no remorse about wounding sixteen-year-old Hermione Granger; in fact, he was grinning about it as he tried to persuade Harry Potter to hand over the prophecy they were fighting over. Dolohov was very proud when he defeated [[Alastor Moody]] in a duel, as Moody was a highly skilled wizard. 

Dolohov also displayed a highly arrogant and self-confident attitude and had developed a habit of engaging more than one opponent at a time or challenging powerful wizards such as the [[Prewett family|Prewett]] brothers, Moody, [[Sirius Black]], [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Filius Flitwick]].

Dolohov was on friendly terms with his fellow Death Eaters, as he seemed to consider [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]] and [[Thorfinn Rowle]] as close friends. When Voldemort spoke of how [[Charity Burbage]] supported [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] rights and would permit breeding with them, Dolohov smiled in a confused fashion as if he literally thought that the idea of doing such a thing was disgusting, showing that he, like other Death Eaters, hated Muggles, [[Muggle-born]]s and most likely people who were [[half-blood]]s and [[blood traitor]]s. Ironically, however, his master was in fact half-blood. It is not mentioned if Dolohov knew or not about Voldemort`s true [[blood status]].



One of the longest-serving, most devoted and sadistic of all of Lord Voldemort’s Death Eaters, Dolohov was a highly powerful and dangerous [[Dark Wizard]]. His immense [[magic]]al skills allowed him to go up against and defeat many powerful wizards and witches of great skill, including many [[Auror]]s and [[Order of the Phoenix]] members.

 duelling [[Sirius Black]] and [[Harry Potter]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]]]
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Antonin Dolohov was an extremely skilful duellist, and was one of the most dangerous and feared [[Death Eaters]]. He participated in the murders of [[Gideon Prewett|Gideon]] and [[Fabian Prewett]], both highly accomplished wizards, during the [[First Wizarding War]]. During the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], he duelled [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Neville Longbottom]] single-handedly, despite a [[Silencing Charm]] forcing him to use all [[nonverbal spell|nonverbal magic]] to do so. He incapacitated Hermione and broke Neville's nose, and Harry only managed to defeat him because he was momentarily distracted. Shortly afterwards, he defeated and injured [[Alastor Moody|Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody]], widely considered to be one of the best [[Auror]]s in recent times (and still highly respected even though he had retired), in a [[Duelling|duel]]. He then went on to duel [[Sirius Black]], and with whom he was equally matched until Harry knocked him out from behind. When he and fellow Death Eater [[Thorfinn Rowle]] ambushed Harry, Ron and Hermione in 1997, Dolohov lasted longer than his partner, defeating Harry and Ron in the process, and was only defeated by Hermione Granger due to a sneak attack. In the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Dolohov duelled and killed [[Remus Lupin]], a powerful wizard who was an expert in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], although it must be noted that Remus was not at the height of his duelling skills as he had spent two months not duelling due to having to constantly watch over his pregnant wife and thus his reflexes had been dulled, which contributed to Dolohov's success. However, although he put up a good fight, Dolohov proved to be unable to defeat the former duelling champion [[Filius Flitwick]], who ultimately bested him and possibly [[Curse-to-kill|cursed-to-kill]].
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a sadistic Death Eater, Dolohov was highly proficient and talented in dark magic and the casting of [[dark charm]]s, making him a formidable [[Dark Wizard]]. He was arrested for torturing Muggles and other enemies so it can be assumed that he was very competent with the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. He was also highly skilful with other [[dark charm]]s, most notably the [[Antonin Dolohov's curse|purple curse]] that he favoured on multiple occasions, as well as the [[Expulso Curse]] and [[Impediment Jinx]].
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Dolohov was able to [[Incarcerous Spell|conjure ropes]] from his wand, which implied he was highly proficient in this notably complicated branch of [[magic]], as [[conjuration]] is an advanced form of transfiguration.

*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Non-verbal magic]]''': Dolohov was highly skilled at nonverbal magic as shown during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] when he was hit with a Silencing Charm cast by Hermione Granger. Despite being unable to speak, he fought Hermione, Harry, and Neville all at once, incapacitating Hermione with [[Antonin Dolohov's curse|his signature spell]] (although its effects were not as powerful). He was also able to cast the [[Incarcerous Spell]] non-verbally.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Dolohov appeared to be skilled with charms, as he was able to cast the [[Summoning Charm]] in a failed attempt to get the prophecy from Harry Potter in 1996, as well as the [[Dancing Feet Spell]], which he successfully used on [[Neville Longbottom]] during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.
*'''[[Spell creation]] (possibly)''': [[Antonin Dolohov's Curse|Dolohov's signature spell]] involved using a slashing movement with his wand which would shoot purple [[fire]] at his victim. He used this spell several times during the battle of the Department of Mysteries ([[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] was the only one to be struck). Dolohov was the only known practitioner of this unidentified spell and may have even invented it himself.
