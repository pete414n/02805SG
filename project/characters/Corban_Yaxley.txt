{{Quote|You realise that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your [[Mary Cattermole|wife]], Cattermole? In fact, I'm quite surprised you’re not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a [[pure-blood]] next time... But if ''my'' wife were accused of being a [[Mudblood]] — not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth — and the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do this job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?|Yaxley cruelly threatening [[Ronald Weasley]], [[Polyjuice Potion|disguised]] as [[Reginald Cattermole]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
'''Corban''' '''Yaxley''' was a [[Dark Wizard]] and a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who fought during the [[First Wizarding War]]. Yaxley did not search for [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] after his first downfall, but this was forgiven after Voldemort's [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] in [[1995]].  

Yaxley also fought at several battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]], such as the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]. When Voldemort was in control of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], Yaxley became the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. He went on to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where he was subdued by [[George Weasley]] and [[Lee Jordan]].  

His fate after Voldemort's final defeat is uncertain, but he was most likely imprisoned in Azkaban for his crimes against Muggle-borns.  

==Biography==

===First Wizarding War===
Corban Yaxley was one of the many [[Death Eaters]] who fought in the [[First Wizarding War]]. After [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s first downfall, Yaxley managed to avoid imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. Like many others, Yaxley believed Voldemort had been finished and, thus, did not attempt to find him.

===Second Wizarding War===
Yaxley returned to Voldemort after his [[Return of Lord Voldemort|rebirth]]. Yaxley immediately became, once more, an active Death Eater during the [[Second Wizarding War]].

On [[27 June]] [[1995]], three nights following Voldemort's return, Yaxley arrived at [[Horace Slughorn's house|Slughorn's house]] under cover of dark, intending to recruit him or take him by force to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. Transfiguring himself into an armchair, Slughorn successfully evaded the Death Eater's detection. A few days later, Slughorn locked up his house and went on the run, often squatting in Muggle dwellings while the owners were away, where he felt undetectable.

====Battle of the Astronomy Tower====
{{Quote|We've got orders. Draco's got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.|Yaxley pressures Draco to murder Dumbledore|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Dark Mark over Hogwarts 2.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|The [[Dark Mark]] above the [[Astronomy Tower]]]]

In June of [[1997]], Yaxley was among the group of [[Death Eaters]] who led an assault at [[Hogwarts Castle]]. Along with [[Alecto Carrow]], [[Amycus Carrow]], and [[Fenrir Greyback]], they managed to overpower the [[Auror]]s who were assigned to guard the castle, reaching the Astronomy Tower where he pressured [[Draco Malfoy]] to do the deed Voldemort ordered him to perform: murder [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Yaxley was determined to follow the orders, attacking [[Fenrir Greyback|Greyback]] when he moved forward to attack Dumbledore. Before Draco could bring himself to kill him, [[Severus Snape]] arrived and, seeing Draco unable to do it, murdered the Headmaster himself, blasting the body from the tower. The Death Eaters had stood aside due to a fear/respect for Snape's presence, as Yaxley did not try to argue.

The Death Eaters proceeded to flee from the castle before any of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] summoned [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] reinforcements. While getting down from the Astronomy Tower, Yaxley was hit with a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] by [[Harry Potter]].

Later, when Ministry of Magic officials searched the Tower, they found Yaxley and he was likely arrested and taken to [[Azkaban]].

====Ministry take-over====
{{Quote|Yes — my Lord, that is true — but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy, now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring [[Rufus Scrimgeour|Scrimgeour]] down.|Yaxley elaborates on the plan to overthrow the Ministry|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Meeting at Malfoy Manor DHF1.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|Yaxley during the Death Eater meeting at Malfoy Manor]]
A few weeks later, Yaxley had already broken out of [[Azkaban]] and instigated his master's plan to subjugate Ministry officials to begin the silent coup. Yaxley attended the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] meeting at [[Malfoy Manor]] in July of [[1997]]. During the meeting, he reported that he had placed [[Pius Thicknesse]], then head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], under the [[Imperius Curse]] as part of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort's]] plan to take over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

Many of his fellow Death Eaters were impressed, though Voldemort believed Snape's estimate of when Harry would be removed from his relatives' home over Yaxley's. Yaxley fell for the trap set by [[Alastor Moody]] on that count, whereas Snape knew the true date, setting the stage for the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]].

====As Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement====
{{Quote|But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood — not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth —and the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?|Yaxley using his power to intimidate other employees|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Fallen Ministry.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|250x250px|Four of the most consequential figures of the new regime (left to right): [[Albert Runcorn]], Ministry Official; [[Dolores Umbridge]], [[Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic|Senior Undersecretary to the Minister]] and Head of the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]; [[Pius Thicknesse]], [[Minister for Magic]]; and Corban Yaxley, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]
On [[1 August]], [[1997]], Voldemort's plan and Yaxley's efforts succeeded when Minister [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] was murdered and Pius Thicknesse became the [[Imperius Curse|puppet]] Minister for Magic. The Ministry fell under Voldemort's control and Yaxley, as an inner-circle Death Eater, was made the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

In this role, he participated in at least some of the interrogations and harassment of [[Muggle-born]]s, along with Dolores Umbridge, Head of the new Muggle-Born Registration Commission, while using his cruelty and new authority to intimidate lower-ranking employees such as [[Reginald Cattermole]]. The Ministry also designated Harry Potter as "[[Undesirable]] No. 1", under the excuse of him being wanted for questioning of Dumbledore's death. [[Snatchers|Snatcher]] groups were then dispatched to capture any Muggle-borns who refuse to register, along with [[Order of the Phoenix]] members and Harry himself.

The Death Eater led Ministry also took over [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. [[Severus Snape]] was made Headmaster, and Amycus and Alecto Carrow were appointed Professors.

====Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic====
{{Dialogue a-b|Mary Cattermole|They're frightened, they think that I might not come home —|Yaxley|Spare us. The brats of Mud-bloods do not stir our sympathies.|An exchange during the interrogation of Muggle-born [[Mary Cattermole]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:DH1 Yaxley hit by stunning spell.jpg|251x251px|thumb|Yaxley stunned by Harry Potter]]

Yaxley played a major role in this infiltration alongside Dolores Umbridge. During Umbridge's interrogations of Mary Cattermole, as part of the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]], Yaxley sat next to her observing the case. He refused to pity her children, while mocking her questionnaire answers, and having intimidated [[Ronald Weasley]] disguised as [[Reginald Cattermole|her husband]] earlier to get his office dried in time. When Harry and [[Hermione Granger]] reached the courtroom, they saw Umbridge, whom had the [[Slytherin's Locket|locket]] around her neck. Harry (under the [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]]) stunned Umbridge and Yaxley. When Harry, Hermione and Ron freed the Muggle-born prisoners, Yaxley woke up and pursued angrily.

[[File:Tumblr_lr91yjKCr01qeoetoo6_r1_250.gif|left|Yaxley grabs a hold of the trio mid-[[Apparition]]|thumb|245x245px]]

Yaxley madly began to chase the trio as he ordered all [[Floo Network]] transportation to be sealed. At the last moment he grabbed Hermione's arm as the trio [[Apparition|Disapparated]]. Hermione managed to evade him by using a [[Revulsion Jinx]], but not before revealing the location of [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. Thus, the house was no longer a safe hideout for the trio, forcing them to Apparate to the forest in [[Dartmoor]] and leaving Ron [[Splinching|splinched]]. After this the trio had to go on the run and make due with a [[Perkins's tent|tent]]. Harry also speculated that Yaxley was bringing fellow Death Eaters into the house via Apparition.

====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Yaxley|Definitely heard something. Animal, d'you reckon?|Antonin Dolohov|That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here... Time's nearly up. Potter's had his hour. He's not coming.|Better go back. Find out what the plan is now...|Yaxley and Dolohov guarding the [[Forbidden Forest]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Harry-potter7-Death Eaters.jpg|249x249px|thumb|The Death Eater army during the final battle]]

On [[2 May]], [[1998]], Yaxley participated in the Battle of Hogwarts. During the first wave of the battle he can be seen duelling against [[Filius Flitwick]] a short distance away from [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and a masked Death Eater. It's unknown what the outcome of the duel was, but both Yaxley and Flitwick were seen unscathed shortly after.

He and [[Antonin Dolohov]] stood guard in the Forbidden Forest during the brief interlude that followed Voldemort's ultimatum to Harry Potter. They were followed back to the Death Eater camp by Harry under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]]. During the final moments of the battle, Yaxley was defeated by [[Lee Jordan]] and [[George Weasley]]. His ultimate fate is unknown, though if he survived, he was most likely captured and sent to [[Azkaban]] along with the rest of the surviving [[Death Eaters]].

==Physical appearance==
Yaxley was described as having hard, blunt features and an unpleasant smile. He was relatively tall, and has long, pale blond hair tied in a neat braid that hangs down to his lower back. In spite of his snide comment about Lucius Malfoy's fondness for luxury upon seeing a peacock on his property, he shared Malfoy's sense of superiority over the rabble surrounding him, attiring himself in long, magnificent flowing robes to set himself apart from his fellow Ministry officials and highlight his position of power and authority.

As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm, which faded to a mere scar upon Voldemort's death.

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Yaxley at Ministry.jpg|225x225px|thumb|left|Yaxley present at the interrogation of Mary Cattermole, mocking her situation]]

Haughty, blunt, and domineering, Corban Yaxley was a proud, ambitious man with little patience for the feelings and the problems of others, instead choosing to devote his energies towards the fulfilment of the Dark Lord's plans and the fruition of the peaceful society he and his comrades had been promised would follow their master's triumph. Like many other [[Death Eaters]], he subscribed very strongly to the ideology of [[Pure-blood supremacy]], and had no qualms whatsoever in using [[Mudblood|demeaning phrases]] when referring to [[Muggle-born]]s. Upon becoming the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] in 1997, he worked alongside [[Dolores Umbridge]] and the newly established [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] to imprison innocent Muggle-borns in [[Azkaban]] on false charges of having stolen their magic from "real" witches and wizards.

Indeed, during one Muggle-born trial, Yaxley highlighted his immense cruelty through his apparent enjoyment of using his new authority to intimidate and verbally abuse the lower-ranked employees, and even laughed at [[Mary Cattermole]] and contemptuously dismissed her worries for her children, responding that "''the brats of [[Mudblood]]s ''[did]'' not stir ''[his]'' sympathies''". This also indicated that he despises even [[half-blood]]s, despite Voldemort permitting them to continue living in the Wizarding community. He also showed a lust for power and prestige, reflected by how he described in detail on how he subdued Thicknesse and eagerly spoke of the plan to move Harry, in hopes of attracting more praise from Voldemort and fellow Death Eaters. Even so, while he did display a rather ruthless streak, he lacked, or at least overtly lacked, the sadistic and bloodthirsty nature of such comrades as [[Antonin Dolohov]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], being intelligent enough to weigh political reality against a desire for personal, petty revenge. 

Whereas this shrewdness would've been a necessity in regard to maintaining his role of as an agent of the Dark Lord in the Ministry of Magic, it was perhaps best shown through his participation in the [[plot to assassinate Albus Dumbledore]], during which, once they had the Headmaster cornered, wandless and alone, he contrasted [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]]'s gleeful enjoyment of seeing their enemy in such a compromising position by impatiently demanding that [[Draco Malfoy]] killed him so they could flee the area before the school got the chance to notify the Ministry of Magic, as every Death Eater captured in the wake of Dumbledore's death would mean the Dark Forces became a little weaker.

While his loyalty was questioned during the [[Return of Lord Voldemort]] in 1994, it would appear that Yaxley's decision not to search for his master came, rather than a wish to not compromise his freedom and social status after avoiding Azkaban, from a genuine belief that the Dark Lord had met his demise when he failed to kill [[Harry Potter]] on Hallowe'en in 1981. This was shown by how he could be rather harsh with his fellow Death Eaters whenever they went against the Dark Lord's orders, such as when he violently blasted [[Fenrir Greyback]] away from Albus Dumbledore for trying to kill him without letting Draco Malfoy, to whom Voldemort had given the task, have a chance. 

However he did subside when Snape stepped silently forward to accomplish the deed, showing that Yaxley may have a certain level of feared respect for him, or that he might just have been aware that in the event of Draco failing to complete the task at hand, the Dark Lord would naturally have turned to Snape to do it and hence simply let him. Despite this seemingly pragmatic choice of life self-well-being over loyalty to a fallen Voldemort, according to [[Nymphadora Tonks]], Yaxley appeared to be prepared to fight to the death during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], resulting in aggressiveness that overwhelmed the [[Order of the Phoenix]].

==Magical abilities and skills==
Evidently an accomplished [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the fact that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] sent Yaxley on missions such as collecting [[Horace Slughorn]] (whose own magical prowess he respected) and capturing [[Hermione Granger's father|the]] [[Hermione Granger's mother|parents]] of [[Hermione Granger]] (a good friend of Harry Potter's whose house thus were not unlikely to be under the protection of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]) single-handedly speaks for the faith the Dark Lord had in his abilities.
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, Yaxley was presumably skilled in all manner of [[dark charm]]s, including the [[Unforgivable Curses]]. Yaxley was skilled in the use of the [[Imperius Curse]] (which requires genuine ability to perform), being able to keep [[Pius Thicknesse]] under his control throughout the entire war, despite the fact that Thicknesse was actively trying to resist him. He also was also able to cast a powerful jinx that blasted Fenrir Greyback across the room.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Yaxley hit and knocked back Greyback with a powerful [[spell]] without speaking an incantation, which is highly advanced [[magic]], given the difficulty of casting spells non-verbally, and proof of his superior magical skills.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Yaxley was a very proficient duellist, having fought in both the [[First Wizarding War|First]] and the [[Second Wizarding War]]s. He was able to hold his own against former duelling champion [[Filius Flitwick]] and fight him to a stalemate while [[Antonin Dolohov]], one of Voldemort's most sadistic and feared Death Eaters, was defeated by said opponent. Yaxley also took part in the Battle of Astronomy Tower where he likely had to fight off both [[Auror]]s and [[Order of the Phoenix]] members and was only defeated when Harry hit him from behind. He also showed no fear in attacking the savage werewolf [[Fenrir Greyback]] when the latter attempted to disobey orders, nor did he back down when Greyback expressed anger. Yaxley was amongst the Death Eaters who managed to last until the end of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and it took [[George Weasley]] and [[Lee Jordan]] to finally take him down. He was also single-handedly sent to recruit or capture [[Horace Slughorn]] who was regarded as a very skilled wizard.
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Being an accomplished adult wizard, Yaxley was capable of apparating. Yaxley apparated to Lord Voldemort's side upon his rebirth. He also apparated to the [[Malfoy Manor]] to report his progress.

==Possessions==
[[File:YaxleyWandNN8238.jpg|thumb|Yaxley's wand]]
*'''[[Corban Yaxley's wand|Wand]]''': He owned a [[wand]] of unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[Wand core|core]]. He used this wand throughout his life as a Death Eater, and during many battles, such as the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], [[Infiltration of the British Ministry of Magic (1997)|Infiltration of the British Ministry of Magic]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and was capable of performing powerful [[Dark Arts|dark magic]] with his wand, including the [[Unforgivable Curses]].
*[[Corban Yaxley's pocket watch|'''Pocket watch''']]: He owned a [[gold]]en pocket watch, which we wore during his tenure as Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]].

==Relationships==
===Lord Voldemort===
[[File:Voldemort Headshot DHP1.png|thumb|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], his master|alt=|left]]

Yaxley became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and served Lord Voldemort around the [[First Wizarding War]]. When Voldemort met his first downfall at the hands of [[Harry Potter]], Yaxley was not loyal enough to try to find him, as he managed to feign his way out of the Ministry's search by claiming to be under the [[Imperius Curse]]. Thirteen years after this, Yaxley returned to his master's revival, and was forgiven for his loss of faith.

Following this, Yaxley was imprisoned into [[Azkaban]] during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], but was released during a breakout. Despite this, he managed to remain in Voldemort's confidence, and was praised by Voldemort for being able to subdue [[Pius Thicknesse]]. After the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|takeover]] of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], Voldemort placed Yaxley as the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement|Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], showing great faith in him despite the past lack of faith and the imprisonment. This contrasts how [[Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] were treated, whose past failures had led to a loss of faith and respect amongst the ranks of Death Eaters despite the latter's unyielding loyalty.

===Death Eaters===
[[File:Unidentified Death Eater (II).jpg|233x233px|thumb|A Death Eater, his allies|alt=]]
Amongst his fellow [[Death Eaters]], Yaxley has some mixed relationships. He reacted violently against [[Fenrir Greyback]] for trying to kill [[Albus Dumbledore]] when it was assigned to [[Draco Malfoy]], though in all fairness Fenrir was not an official Death Eater, and therefore received little respect amongst them. Yaxley, at the very least, respected [[Severus Snape]] with a sense of fear, as he backed down when Snape stepped forward to kill Dumbledore. He received many praises from the Death Eaters when he went into detail in subduing Thicknesse, though he seemed a little envious when Snape was receiving slightly more attention and praise from Voldemort. He also appeared to be on good terms with [[Antonin Dolohov]] who patted him on the back during the meeting and were seen conversing together while on the lookout for [[Harry Potter]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

He seems to have a sarcastic opinion on Lucius Malfoy's extravagance and show off attitude on his wealth. When he and Snape encountered an albino peacock on a hedge in front of Malfoy Manor, he sneered that Lucius always did himself well. He was also present when Lucius's son, Draco cornered Albus Dumbledore. He grew impatient when Draco was hesitant to kill the headmaster, and aggressively ordered him to do so quickly. When Voldemort humiliated the Malfoys during the first meeting, he joined his fellow Death Eaters in their mocking and sneering laughter.

===Ministry of Magic Employees===
During his tenure as the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Yaxley abused his position by intimidating the less-ranking employees, such as [[Reginald Cattermole]], especially for marrying [[Mary Cattermole|a muggle-born]], and threatened him to have his office dried out within one hour or have his wife face even more dire consequences. He also ignored a wizard's greeting, showing little respect for those he did not deem worthy. However, he did nod approvingly at [[Albert Runcorn]], showing respect for a fellow pure-blood supremacist. Seeing Yaxley scold and intimidate the [[trio]] in disguise, other employees refrained themselves from entering the same lift as them, as though in fear of infection.

He worked alongside [[Dolores Umbridge]] as part of the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. The two shared a strong hatred for muggle borns and worked together effectively in prosecuting them.

===Muggle-borns and half-bloods===
As a Death Eater who believed in [[Blood status|blood purity]], Yaxley shows hatred and contempt for [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s and [[Muggle-born]]s alike. During his time in assisting [[Dolores Umbridge]] in prosecuting the captured Muggle-borns, he ruthlessly sneered at their despair and ignored their pleas. He made it clear that he would never marry any woman who would be even mistaken for a "[[Mudblood]]", nor cared about the children of such a marriage.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:LEGO Yaxley.png|110px|thumb|Yaxley in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]
*Yaxley is portrayed by [[Scotland|Scottish]] actor [[Peter Mullan]] in {{DH|F1}}.
*It is likely that Yaxley is [[Yaxley family|related]] to [[Lysandra Yaxley|Lysandra Black (née Yaxley)]], wife of [[Arcturus Black II]] and maternal grandmother of [[Arthur Weasley]], and thus to the [[House of Black|Black]], [[Crouch family|Crouch]], [[Longbottom family|Longbottom]], and [[Weasley family|Weasley]] families, albeit distantly. 
*At one point Yaxley mentions having a wife to [[Reginald Cattermole]] (really a disguised [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]), though it's possible that he was only speaking hypothetically. Though he makes it clear that he would never be married to anyone who would even be mistaken for a muggle-born.
*When Yaxley first appears he is unnamed, only being referred to as the "Brutal-Faced Death Eater" until he is properly identified in the next book.
*In {{DH|GA1}} Yaxley never appears at all, and except for his name having been mentioned in passing, his role during the [[Infiltration of the British Ministry of Magic (1997)]] is taken instead by a [[Ministry of Magic meeting assigner|senior Ministry official]] (who takes "Reginald Cattermole" and "Mafalda Hopkirk" into a meeting) and by a masked, unidentified Death Eater (who grabs Ron Weasley at one of the fireplaces).
