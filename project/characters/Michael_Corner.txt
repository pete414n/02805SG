{{Dialogue a-b-a|Ron Weasley|Which one was Michael Corner?|Hermione Granger|The dark one.|I didn't like him.|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s negative impression of Michael|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

'''Michael Corner''' (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]) was a [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[Harry Potter]]'s year. He was friends with house mates [[Terry Boot]] and [[Anthony Goldstein]].   

In his fifth year, he joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by Harry. That year, Michael also dated [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], though she dumped him by the end of the school year, after which Michael dated [[Cho Chang]].  

In his [[1997–1998 school year|seventh year]], he rejoined the D.A. and fought courageously in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. He presumably survived, as his name was not given among the [[Fallen Fifty|fallen deceased]]. He was most likely present for Harry Potter's final defeat of [[Lord Voldemort]]. 

==Biography==

===Early life===
Michael was born in either [[1979]] or [[1980]]. His family had both presumably [[Magic genes|magical]] and [[Non-magic people|muggle]] heritage.

===Hogwarts years {{C|1991–1998}}===
====Early years====
Michael Corner started his [[first year]] [[magic]]al education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] at the same time as [[Harry Potter]], in [[1991]]. Michael was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into the house [[Ravenclaw]] upon his arrival at Hogwarts. Michael would have shared a few classes with Harry Potter but as he was in a different house the two did not really get to know each other too well.

====Fourth year====
{{Quote|Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago.|Hermione discusses Ginny's changed feelings|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[File:B4C23M1 Weird Sisters playing at the Yule Ball.png|250px|thumb|left|The Yule Ball that Michael attended where he meet Ginny Weasley]] 

During [[1994–1995 school year]], his [[fourth year]], Hogwarts was host to the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. As part of the traditions the [[Yule Ball]] was held and it was here that Michael first met [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], a [[Gryffindor]] in the year below himself. Ginny had recently gotten over her crush on [[Harry Potter]] and eventually towards the end of July [[1995]], the two began dating after becoming more friendly with one another at the ball. 

Ginny's brother, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], didn't find out about their relationship until a few months after it began and it was likely the two kept it quiet as he would disapprove. However, [[Hermione Granger]] apparently had known about the relationship for some time before Ron's discovery. After finding out the two were dating Ron would frequently question Michael's intelligence, something Ravenclaws pride themselves on. At the end of the school year [[Cedric Diggory]], boyfriend of fellow Ravenclaw student [[Cho Chang]], was tragically murdered and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] returned to power. These claims were not widely believed and Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] was [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|slated]] as mad and seditious by the [[British Ministry of Magic]], who were deeply paranoid and ignorant about Voldemort returning to power.

====Fifth year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Ron Weasley|Michael — but — but you were going out with him!|Ginny Weasley|Not any more. He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.|Ginny discussing her break-up with Michael|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[File:Hog Head's meeting.jpg|250px|thumb|Michael sitting next to Ginny Weasley and Zacharias Smith during the meeting in the Hog's Head]]

The [[1995–1996 school year]] was Michael's [[Fifth year]] of education, an important year for students as he would be taking his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]'s. This year [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] had been put under the watchful eye of Ministry employee, [[Dolores Umbridge]] following the previous years events. After Umbridge's refusal to teach students any form of practical [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] and with an [[Second Wizarding War|imposing war]] ahead, [[Hermione Granger]] founded a secret alliance called [[Dumbledore's Army]] where students could be taught how to defend themselves by [[Harry Potter]]. 

Thanks to [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny's]] influence Michael and his friends, including [[Terry Boot]], joined Dumbledore's Army. Michael questioned Hermione's motives for forming the group as he suspected she only wanted to pass her O.W.L. exam later in the year, during the meeting at the [[Hog's Head Inn]], however Michael signed up. At the first D.A. meeting, Michael had difficulty disarming [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] because of his feelings for her. After the first D.A. meeting, Hermione informed Harry and Ron that Michael was only present because Ginny attended and went on to tell the two about their relationship.

[[File:Michael D.A..jpg|250px|thumb|left|Michael during a D.A. meeting practising disarming]]

Also that year, Ginny had replaced Harry on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] when he was permanently banned by Umbridge. After Gryffindor beat [[Ravenclaw]] in the Quidditch Final, Michael expressed his displeasure of the result and the relationship ended; she later called him a "''bad loser''". Michael soon began dating Harry's recent ex-girlfriend, the [[Seeker]] from his own team, [[Cho Chang]]. Michael had expressed interest in how Cho's boyfriend had been murdered last year and it is possible the two talked about the sensitive issue and sought comfort in one another. At the end of the school year [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s return was publicly declared and the [[Second Wizarding War]] broke out.

====Sixth year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Michael Corner|Have you ever taken it, sir?|Horace Slughorn|“Twice in my life. Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days.|Michael asking [[Horace Slughorn]] about [[Felix Felicis]] during a Potions lesson|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Slughorn pottermore.jpg|250px|thumb|Michael in N.E.W.T.-level potions]]
Michael was intelligent enough to achieve a high [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] score on his [[Potions (class)|Potions]] exam and was one of only twelve students (along with house mate [[Terry Boot]]) in 1996 to advance to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level in his [[sixth year]]. At the end of the academic year a [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower|battle]] broke out in the castle and D.A. members were summoned, but Michael for some reason did not receive the summoning as he did not participate in the battle.

====Seventh year====
{{Quote|Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they'd chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.|Neville discussing the student rebellion|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

During [[1997–1998 school year]], Michael's [[seventh year]] at Hogwarts, the school was under the indirect control of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], who had taken over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Michael joined the reconstituted [[Dumbledore's Army]] in defying the newly appointed and tyrannical [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[professor]]s [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]]. The reformed student alliance took pride in creating havoc for the Death Eater's and would often paint messages such as ''Dumbledore's Army: Still Recruiting'' around the school.

On one occasion, Michael sneaked out and released a [[first year]] that had been chained up by the Carrows. As punishment for releasing the first-year from imprisonment Michael was tortured greatly for it, possibly with the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. The Carrows made an example of Michael and soon the rebellion began to quiet down for fear of similar consequences. 

[[File:D.a. in 1998.gif|250px|thumb|left|[[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members welcome Harry back in 1998]]

By the end of the school year, Michael was one of the many D.A. members holed up in the [[Room of Requirement]], seeking sanctuary. When [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] returned to the school in May of 1998, Michael was one of the students who spoke up in favour of overthrowing the Death Eater professors. He also participated in the discussion of the [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|lost diadem]] of [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]. Michael was doubtful that Harry would be able to find the diadem, but agreed to hold off Voldemort and his Death Eater army whilst he tried.

=====Battle of Hogwarts=====
{{Quote|Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner.|The D.A. members residing in the Room of Requirement|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|alt=|thumb|250x250px|Michael and the other defenders of Hogwarts witness Harry Potter's final defeat of Voldemort]]
Consequently the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] broke out and Michael fought. Michael and Cho appeared more than friendly with one another when she returned to Hogwarts to fight after having graduated the previous year. It is possible the two were still dating. However, as [[Cho Chang|Cho]] was noted as appearing overly interested in Harry again, it is also possible that Michael and Cho broke up before Voldemort's takeover. Michael fought a Death Eater just before [[Molly Weasley]] duelled [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].

===Later life {{C|post 1998}}===
It can be presumed that Michael survived the Battle of Hogwarts, as he was not mentioned along with the [[Fallen Fifty|fifty casualties]]. If he did, Michael and Cho later broke up sometime after the war as Cho later would marry a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]. If he survived, he likely attended the [[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL|2014 reunion]] of [[Dumbledore's Army]].

==Physical appearance==
Michael was described as "the dark one" by Hermione Granger when talking to Ronald Weasley. 

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Michael was very proficient in the [[magic]] of potion-making, as he was one of four [[Ravenclaw]]s in [[1996]] to progress to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level. He must have earned either an '[[Outstanding]]' or an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' on his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam in order to progress to such an advanced [[Potions (class)|class]]. 
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Michael was a loyal member of the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] and being so he must have mastered numerous defensive and offensive spells under [[Harry Potter]]'s exemplary teaching. 
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Michael was capable of producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], a piece of highly advanced [[magic]] and a mark of superior magical ability. 
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Michael fought bravely in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Death Eaters]] and presumably survived, showing he had a certain level of skill as a duellist.  

==Relationships==
===Ginny Weasley===
{{Dialogue a-b|George Weasley|So what about Michael Corner?|Ginny Weasley|I dumped him, he was a bad loser.|Ginny telling her brother [[George Weasley]] about Michael|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:HBP-promo-harry-potter-9632237-1920-2560.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|270x270px|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], his ex-girlfriend]]
Micheal and Ginny Weasley met at the [[Yule Ball]] in [[1994]], and began dating at the end of the school year, she used the relationship as an attempt to "move on" from Harry Potter. In [[1995]] she brought him and some of his friends along to the first meeting of what would become [[Dumbledore's Army]]. When the two duelled during meetings Michael did not hit Ginny with anything, possibly because she was his girlfriend. When Michael drew unnecessary attention to the D.A. at one point, Ginny called him a "''fool''", though not to his face.

Ginny ended the relationship on the basis of Michael being a "''bad loser''," following Michael's poor reaction to Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw in a [[Quidditch]] match. Michael went on to date [[Cho Chang]], who (like Ginny) also had a romance with [[Harry Potter]].

==Etymology==
The name "Michael" is from the Hebrew name מִיכָאֵל (''Mikha'el'') meaning "who is like God?". This is a rhetorical question, implying no person is like God. Saint Michael was one of the seven archangels in Hebrew tradition and the only one identified as an archangel in the Bible. In the Book of Revelation in the New Testament he is portrayed as the leader of heaven's armies, and thus is considered the patron saint of soldiers.

==Behind the scenes==
[[file:Michael corner pottermore.png|180px|thumb|Michael as shown on {{PM}}]]{{Quote|Not with the [[Unidentified female Hungarian Horntail|dragon]], you didn’t, that was a seriously cool bit of [[Flight|flying]]....|Michael complimenting Harry's performance in the first task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
*Michael Corner dated both of the girls that [[Harry Potter]] dated, [[Ginevra Weasley]] and [[Cho Chang]], except in reverse order.
*Michael Corner was portrayed by [[Ryan Nelson]] in {{OOTP|FA}}, credited as "slightly creepy boy". In the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of ''Order of the Phoenix'', Michael is voiced by [[Niall Galvin]].
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, Michael Corner did not attend the O.W.L.s Exam as he was wearing muggle attire during the Fireworks scene together with [[Zacharias Smith]]. However, this could not be considered as canon.
*Michael was portrayed by [[Jack Read]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|film adaptation]] of {{DH}}​.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{HBP}}, there is a student who asks what is the potion of [[Felix Felicis]]. In the book this is Michael Corner, so it is likely that this student is also him.
