{{Quote|It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son.

'''Ignotus Peverell''' ([[12 July]], [[1214]]–[[19 May]], [[1292]]<ref name="age" />) was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]]<ref name="blood"/> [[wizardkind|wizard]], one of the three brothers mentioned in ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'' in {{TBB}}. The youngest of the three brothers, Ignotus was also described as the humblest and wisest of them. He had survived [[Death (The Tale of the Three Brothers)|Death]]'s cunning schemes due to these traits. 

He received the last of the [[Deathly Hallows]], the [[Cloak of Invisibility]], which was passed down through his family to the [[Potter family]], and eventually to [[Harry Potter]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Little is known about Ignotus Peverell's childhood. He was born into the [[Peverell family]] on [[12 July]], [[1214]]<ref name="age"/> in the village of [[Godric's Hollow]] in the [[England|English]] [[West Country]],<ref name="DH35"/> a younger brother to [[Antioch Peverell|Antioch]] and [[Cadmus Peverell|Cadmus]].

Being knowledgeable in the magical arts,<ref name="DH35"/> it is unknown whether the Peverell brothers attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], were home-schooled or learned about the magical arts on their own, autodidactically.

===The Deathly Hallows===
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|So it's true? All of it? The Peverell brothers —|Albus Dumbledore|— were the three brothers of the tale. Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road… I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects.|[[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] during the former's time in [[Limbo]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Tumblr m4eabyXx1j1qcd6r7o4 r1 250.gif|left|thumb|245px|Death reluctantly handing over a piece of his own cloak]] 

According to [[Beedle the Bard]] in his work ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'', Ignotus was the humblest and wisest of the three Peverell brothers. When the three brothers managed to cheat [[Death (The Tale of the Three Brothers)|Death]] while travelling along a "''[[Lonely, winding road (The Tale of the Three Brothers)|lonely, winding road at twilight]]''", Death pretended to congratulate them on their [[magic]] and presented them with a gift of their choice. Ignotus did not trust [[Death (The Tale of the Three Brothers)|Death]] by any means. 

So, rather than ask for something to further his own desires, he requested the power to leave that meeting without being followed by Death. Death, not wishing to betray any hint of his true intentions, most begrudgingly took his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]] and gave it to Ignotus. Ignotus's two older brothers met terrible fates due to the murderous lust the [[Elder Wand]] created in wizards, and the limitations of the [[Resurrection Stone]].<ref name="DH21" />

It should be noted, however, that [[Beedle the Bard]] most likely employed artistic licence as some aspects of his story seem not to match actual aspects of the Peverells' lives (e.g. the story heavily implies that [[Cadmus Peverell]] killed himself before having descendants,<ref name="DH21" /> when in actuality he was a direct ancestor to the [[House of Gaunt]]<ref name="HBP10">{{HBP|B|10}}</ref>, and Ignotus Peverell could never have had children if he had always kept his invisibility cloak on,) and, as such, it should not be taken as an accurate account of the historical facts. As [[Albus Dumbledore]] himself theorised, it is much more likely that the Peverell brothers, as gifted wizards, managed to create the [[Deathly Hallows]] by themselves.<ref name="DH35" />

===Later life and death===
[[File:Tumblr m87k8sw1Ku1qili3vo2 250.gif|240px|thumb|Death takes Ignotus Peverell from this life, as his son is left with the Cloak of Invisibility|alt=|left]]

Ignotus most likely married at some point, having had [[Ignotus Peverell's son|a son]],<ref name="DH21" /> and a granddaughter [[Iolanthe Peverell|Iolanthe]], who married [[Hardwin Potter]].

Ignotus went on to live to seventy-six years, dying on [[19 May]], [[1292]]<ref name="age" /> in his birthplace of [[Godric's Hollow]].<ref name="DH35" /> He left his son his [[Cloak of Invisibility]], one of the [[Deathly Hallows]],<ref name="DH21" /> and was buried in the churchyard by the [[St Jerome's Church|Parish Church of St. Clementine]].<ref name="DH16">{{DH|B|16}}</ref> His date of birth and death however can be contested. Ignotus' granddaugter ([[Iolanthe Peverell|Iolanthe]]) married the son ([[Hardwin Potter|Hardwin]]) of [[Linfred of Stinchcombe|Lindfred 'the Potterer' of Stinchcombe]], a 12th century wizard. Ignotus can not have lived and died in the [[13th century]] if his granddaughter married the son of a [[12th century]] wizard.

===Post-mortem===
[[File:IgnotusPeverellGrave.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ignotus Peverell's gravestone|Ignotus's gravestone]] by the late [[1990s]]]]
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione Granger|Look at this! Harry, that's the mark in the book!|Harry Potter|Yeah… it could be…|It says Ig — Ignotus, I think…|[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Harry Potter|Harry]] come across Ignotus's weathered grave in [[1997]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
In [[1899]], [[Gellert Grindelwald]] stayed with his great-aunt [[Bathilda Bagshot]] in [[Godric's Hollow]] in an attempt to "''explore the place the third brother had died" ''as he sought the [[Deathly Hallows]].<ref name="DH35" />

In late [[December]], [[1997]], [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] came across [[Ignotus Peverell's gravestone|Ignotus Peverell's much eroded grave]], where they noted the [[sign of the Deathly Hallows]] was engraved beneath the barely legible name.<ref name="DH16" />

==Personality and traits==
According to legend, Ignotus was a very wise, modest, and humble young man, far more so than his two self-centered, arrogant older brothers. He was therefore far more shrewd and was the only one of the three to see through [[Death (The Tale of the Three Brothers)|Death]]'s deception. His request for something to hide him from Death, rather than something to enhance his own very personal glory, kept him alive for many happy decades.

Ignotus preferred a rather joyful, peaceful life, unlike his brothers. As such, he lived for many years with no quarrels or worries and raised a family. Ignotus saw to it that the very last thing he did in his life was pass the cloak on to his [[Ignotus' son|son]], guaranteeing that his future descendants could live long happy lives as he had, and when he finally left the mortal world with Death, Ignotus had no regrets.<ref name="DH21" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
Ignotus was described by [[Albus Dumbledore]] to be a gifted and dangerously powerful wizard.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Ignotus could [[Bridge-conjuring spell|create]] a perfect bridge without fail alongside his two brothers via [[Conjuration]], which was a complex form of magic.<ref name="DH21" />
*'''Magical manufacturer (possibly)''': Legend has it that [[Death (The Tale of the Three Brothers)|Death]] was the original owner of the [[Cloak of Invisibility]] and handed it to Ignotus when he asked it.<ref name="DH21" /> However, some people like [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] have speculated that Ignotus created the cloak himself.<ref name="DH35" /> To this day, the Cloak remains the only [[Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallow]] still owned and used, moreover by Ignotus's direct [[Potter family|descendants]]. The [[Elder Wand]] and [[Resurrection Stone]] were never used again after [[1998]] further contributing to how Ignotus' humble nature ultimately proved vastly more successful than that of his brothers.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
Interestingly enough, though not surprisingly, the word "Ignotus" is yet another of Rowling's uses of the Latin language. One meaning of the word is "unknown", which would make the name appropriate due to Ignotus' mastery of invisibility and successful concealment from even Death. It is also another form of the name Ignatius, which shows up throughout history, such as {{W|Ignatius of Loyola}} or {{W|Ignatius of Antioch}}.

Ignatius of Antioch's musings on death could link him to Ignotus's etymological origins. Theologically, Ignatius of Antioch considered salvation as one being free from the powerful fear of death. Furthermore he regarded the Christian Eucharist as a medicine for immortality and a remedy to escape death.

"Ignotus" (Latin word "'''īgnōtus'''") in addition to "unknown", may mean "forgiven", "strange", "unacquainted with", or "ignorant of".<ref>[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ignotus]</ref>

Some Christians have theorised that, if accepting "forgiven" as the meaning of the name, Ignotus' Invisibility Cloak may have some similarity to the concept of "the garments of salvation" and a "robe of victory"(Isaiah 61:10)<ref>http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1061.htm</ref>. In Christianity, it is suggested that becoming a slave of righteousness leads to holiness and thus eternal life (Romans 6) - as opposed to becoming a slave of sin, which leads to death. The concept of Jesus' death and resurrection granting forgiveness of sin (also Romans 6) might be interpreted as the "forgiven" being granted a "garment of salvation / robe of victory" and thus, defeating death. 

If translating Ignotus as "strange", we might simply be seeing a bit of J.K. Rowling's quirky humour.

If translating Ignotus as "unacquainted with", we might consider Ignotus as unacquainted with Death for a lot longer than he perhaps should have been. However, as the story mentions that he met Death, then at the end of his life greeted Death as an "old friend"<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|E}}</ref> he appears to have been acquainted with Death for much of his life.

If translating Ignotus as "ignorant of", we may take the meaning to refer to Ignotus' ability to hide, so that others were ''ignorant of'' him. It is an error to translate Ignotus only as "ignorant".

==Behind the scenes==
*According to the book ''[[Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy]]'', the surname of Peverell disappeared fairly early in wizarding history. It is said that Ignotus had a son. Not far down the line, one of his descendants must have given birth to a girl, which would explain why the surname disappeared so quickly. According to J.K. Rowling, James Potter got the Invisibility Cloak from his [[James Potter's father|father]].<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-aol-chat.htm "America Online chat transcript, AOL.com, 19 October 2000"] on [http://www.accio-quote.org/index.html Accio Quote]</ref>
*''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'' states that Ignotus died when he "attained a great age", but {{HPFW}} puts his age at the time of his death as seventy-six, which is not considered old in wizarding terms. However, ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'' are fairy tales and do not portray everything as it was in reality. Another possibility is that the average lifespan of wizards was shorter during the Peverell brothers' time. Seventy-seven may have been considered a great age for wizards in the 1200s because of the level of bloodshed and duelling involved in those days, with the average lifespan for ordinary humans during the Middles Ages usually being less than half that amount.
*A fan hypothesis exists in which Ignotus is also the creator of the [[Pensieve]], which keeps those invisible whilst in the past as opposed to the cloak which hides those in the present.
*Both Ignotus and his descendant [[Harry Potter]] were born in July and seem to share similar traits.
