'''Arnold'''<ref name="HBP7">{{HBP|B|7}} - "The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his travelling basket; and Hedwig; Ron’s owl, Pigwidgeon; and Ginny’s new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages."</ref> was [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]'s purple [[Pygmy Puff]],<ref name="HBP7"/> or miniature [[Puffskein]].<ref name="HBP6"/>

==Biography==
Arnold was purchased from Ginny's brothers [[Fred and George Weasley]] at [[Weasley's Wizard Wheezes|their shop]] in August of [[1996]].<ref name="HBP6"/> Arnold was transported in a cage during the car ride from [[The Burrow]] to [[King's Cross Station]] on [[1 September]] 1996.<ref name="HBP7"/>

In the [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor common room]] in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] he was seen playing with Ginny<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}} - “...Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while...”</ref> or riding her shoulder.<ref name="HBP14">{{HBP|B|14}} - "As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels […] Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold."</ref> It is likely that he was taken with the Weasleys when the family went into hiding in the spring of [[1998]].

==Etymology==
Ginny's father, [[Arthur Weasley]], was mistakenly called "Arnold Weasley" in a [[FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC|1994 ''Daily Prophet'' article]] written by [[Rita Skeeter]]. "Arnold" is also an anagram of "Ronald", a possible reference to [[Ronald Weasley|Ginny's older brother]].

==Behind the scenes==
*In the novel he is purple, but in {{HBP|FA}}, he is pink.
*In {{LEGO|Y2}} Ginny has Arnold already in [[1995]] and the player can use him in the levels.
*According to the Hogwarts [[Shopping List|supply list]], students are allowed to take an [[owl]], a [[cat]], or a [[toad]] to Hogwarts. However, it seems that Ginny was allowed to take her pygmy puff like her [[Ronald Weasley|brother]] was able to bring his [[rat]].
*Funko's Mystery Mini: Harry Potter S2 will feature the film version of Arnold has an exclusivity sold at Barnes & Noble only.<ref>https://funko.com/blogs/news/coming-soon-harry-potter-mystery-minis-supercute-plushies</ref>
