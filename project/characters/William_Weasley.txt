He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1982]] to [[1989]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. Bill was both a [[Prefect]] and [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]].

Bill and Fleur then moved to [[Shell Cottage]], where they assisted [[Harry Potter|Harry]], Ron, and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] after their escape from [[Malfoy Manor]]. Bill later fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] alongside the rest of the Order and survived.

Following the war, Bill and Fleur had three children: [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], and [[Louis Weasley]]. Bill also had several nieces and nephews. 

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1970–1982}}===
William Weasley was the first of seven children born to [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]].<ref name="COS4">{{COS|B|4}}</ref> He was a child during the height of the [[First Wizarding War]], in which his maternal uncles, [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], were murdered fighting [[Antonin Dolohov]] and four other [[Death Eaters]].<ref>{{OOTP|B|9}}</ref> While he was still a child, the [[Wizarding world]] became peaceful again (for a time) after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s first defeat on [[31 October]] [[1981]].

Bill and his five brothers — Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, and Ron — as well as his younger sister, Ginny,<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref> grew up in the Burrow on the outskirts of the village of [[Ottery St Catchpole]] in [[Devon]], [[England]]. Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing, and simple maths by his mother. 

The Weasley family was not wealthy compared to other wizarding families. Many other [[pure-blood]] families, particularly the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]], disdained them for their "''blood traitor''", pro-muggle beliefs and their lack of wealth.<ref>{{COS|B|7}}</ref> They tried their best to make up for this with their [[love]] towards each other and for other people. It can be assumed that Bill had a fairly happy childhood, as all the Weasley siblings did.

===Hogwarts years {{C|1982–1989}}===
====Early years====
Bill arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September]], [[1982]]. Among his fellow first years were, presumably, the future [[Weird Sisters]] members [[Kirley Duke]] and [[Myron Wagtail]]. Sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]], Bill quickly proved himself an academically strong and popular student. His best subject was [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].

At some point, either shortly before or just after he began attending school, an older student by the name of [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] was [[Discipline at Hogwarts#Expulsion|expelled]] for endangering the school in his search of the fabled [[Cursed Vaults]], which was announced in the [[Daily Prophet]] and swiftly became the talk of the [[The Burrow|Weasley household]], which made Bill sympathise with the hardships of their younger sibling, who began attending school in his third year and were met with much whispering of Jacob's plight.<ref name="y2ch6">{{HM|2|6}}</ref>

====Third year====
In the [[1984–1985 school year]], his [[third year]], Bill somehow took all five elective subjects: [[Muggle Studies]], [[Care of Magical Creatures]], [[Divination (class)|Divination]], [[Arithmancy (class)|Arithmancy]], and [[Study of Ancient Runes]].<ref name="OWLS">{{COS|B|4}} - It is said that Bill earned twelve [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s, meaning he must have taken all five elective classes, along with the standard seven subjects.</ref> It is unknown how Bill managed to cope with such a work heavy school schedule. 

During the same school year, Bill learned that [[Jacob's sibling]] had been involved in their own search for the [[Cursed Vaults]], leading to them entering a locked room on the fifth floor along with some fellow first-years containing [[cursed ice]], which, as word spread quickly at Hogwarts, soon became common knowledge among the students.

====Fourth year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Jacob's sibling|Are you ready for this, Bill?|Bill Weasley|Ready? This is my time to stop talking about being a Curse-Breaker and actually being one.|[[Jacob's sibling]] and Bill Weasley just before their mission|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
[[File:Bill-Weasley-duelling.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Bill practising [[duelling]] in the castle's [[Training Grounds|courtyard]]]]
By his fourth year, Bill had become very popular among the other students and was regarded by many, including [[Rowan Khanna]], as one of the bravest and most gifted students of his year. Usually found practising defensive spells in the [[Training Grounds]], he was approached by Jacob's sibling, who asked him for help investigating the Cursed Vaults.<ref name="y2ch5">{{HM|2|5}}</ref>

To this, Bill heartily agreed, voicing the opinion that the cursed ice that had begun to spread throughout the school because someone had been meddling with one or more of said vaults, after all, were posing a threat to the entire school and he would gladly do whatever he could to help resolve the dire situation, expressing excitement at the prospect of his first "''curse-breaking adventure''". 

In preparation for entering the vault, Bill taught Jacob's sibling the [[Fire-Making Spell]], practised duelling and studied all known information about the vaults, including reviewing the old articles concerning Jacob and his expulsion. After these things were taken care of, Bill met up with the younger student to enter the vault, insisted that he was excited to finally have an opportunity to act as a Curse-Breaker as opposed to merely talking about becoming one.<ref name="y2ch6" />

Once they entered the ice-covered outer hall leading into the vault itself, Bill marvelled at the complexity of magic required to build such a place. Finding their path blocked by massive blocks of cursed ice reaching all the way up to the high, arching ceiling. The pair had to get past these obstacles, which Jacob's sibling speculated might be additional defences put in place to prevent people from reaching the vault, by working together to melt them down with flames from their wands. Once they reached the door, however, Bill, mindful of the details he had received of what happened to Rowan, insisted they would have to "''attack the door before it had a chance to attack them''".<ref name="HM27">{{HM|2|7}}</ref>

Trying to force their way through the door the same way they had done to break through the cursed ice, Bill was caught off guard when it countered the flames and shot a jet of icy light at him without warning, encasing him in a block of cursed ice and restraining his arms and feet. Jacob's sibling was concerned that they might accidentally hurt Bill if they tried to melt the ice surrounding him. First meaning to run for help, the aforementioned individual finally made their best effort to carefully cast the Fire-Making Spell on the ice, freeing him. Bill informed them of how, while he had suffered no physical injury, it felt as if the cursed ice had somehow drained him of energy, and Jacob's sibling agreed it would be best to simply leave.

Although he spent some time recovering from his injuries at the [[Hospital Wing]], Bill was quick to dismiss the concerns of Jacob's sibling, telling them how he had never felt as alive before as when the two had tried to break into the vault, eager to give it another try, though wisely suggesting they brought some more people into their second attempt, to which Jacob's sibling voiced their intention of enlisting the aid of Rowan, [[Ben Copper]] and [[Penny Haywood]], all of whom Bill urged his fellow pupil to arm with the knowledge and skills necessary to use the Fire-Making Spell as well, and Jacob's sibling also got the idea of helping Ben make some [[Burn-Healing Paste]], prompting Jacob's sibling to take the nervously inclined [[Gryffindor]] in the [[Potions Classroom]].<ref name="HM28">{{HM|2|8}}</ref>

[[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] got furious at Bill for teaching the Charm to Ben and Penny, causing Bill to worry that he might not be appointed Prefect later.<ref name="HM2NP">{{HM|2|Nobody's Prefect}}</ref>

====Final years====
[[File:Prefect Convention.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Bill at a Prefect convention]]
In the [[1986–1987 school year]], Bill became a [[Prefect]],<ref>Strongly implied in {{OOTP|B|9}}, confirmed in {{HM|3|2}}</ref> and helped [[Jacob's sibling]], who was helping [[Rubeus Hagrid]], find [[Fang]] in the [[Hogwarts Library]].<ref>{{HM|3|Giant Problems}}</ref> He had a crush on [[Emily Tyler]] and sought advice on romance from Jacob's sibling.<ref name="Y3sq">{{HM|3|Bill's Secret}}</ref> He obtained twelve [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.Ls]].<ref name="COS4" />

In the [[1988–1989 school year]], his [[seventh year]], Bill was made [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]].<ref name="PS6" /> At some point, Bill had a [[William Weasley's South American pen-friend|pen-friend]] at [[Castelobruxo]], the wizarding school in [[Brazil]]. When his pen-friend wanted him to go on an exchange trip, Bill had to decline because his parents could not afford it. His pen-friend, though, was offended and sent him a cursed hat that made his ears shrivel up.<ref name="GOF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>

At some time prior to his graduation, Bill was given a "Medal of Magical Merit".<ref>[http://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/File:TrophyNameProductionList.jpg The trophy list] in 1991 has Bill's name on it. As he had graduated in 1989, he has to have been given it before then.</ref>

===Working for Gringotts {{C|1989–1995}}===
{{Quote|Arthur Weasley, Head of the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]] at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.

The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children currently attend.|[[MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Bill at Gringotts.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Bill in front of Gringotts, shortly after being accepted for a job there]]
After graduating from Hogwarts, Bill ultimately managed to live up to his life-long aspirations of joining the [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]]. Having successfully found an opening for [[Curse-Breaker]]s, applied and been accepted, Bill threw himself into his work, pouring all of his energies into his curse-breaking missions not to think too much about the betrayal of [[Patricia Rakepick]] at the end of his final term at school. 

Frequently concerned about the well-being of his friends back at school, not to mention that of his younger brothers [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]], who were all attending Hogwarts at the time, he eventually contacted [[Albus Dumbledore]] expressing his concern of the news he had received telling him about the apparent ineffectiveness of [[Unidentified 1989–1990 Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher|Rakepick's successor]] as [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] Professor.<ref name="HM65"/>

He asked if he might be granted permission to visit the school whenever he had down time in between his missions in order to offer supplementary evening classes on the subject in order to help pupils learn how to defend themselves should Rakepick or other members of [[R]] to breach the security of the castle once more. Wholeheartedly agreeing, not only did the [[Hogwarts Headmaster]] permit him to visit the school on a regular basis throughout the [[1989–1990 school year]] and [[1990–1991 school year]], he even gave him free access to [[Classroom 3C]] after regular classes were done for the day.<ref name="HM65">{{HM|6|5}}</ref><ref name="HM73dada">{{HM|7|3|dada}}</ref>

Around [[December]] [[1989]], Bill was sent to an assignment on some tombs in [[Egypt]],<ref name="HM2Christmas">{{HM|2|Christmas at the Burrow}} - Information revealed if playing this adventure in the sixth year</ref> during which he encountered a [[Mummy]] that he successfully defeated by blasting it to dust; a story he later told his younger brother [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]].<ref name="TDT">{{HM|6|THE DRAGON'S TREASURE}}</ref> On his way to the celebrate [[Christmas]] with his family at [[The Burrow]], he stopped by Hogwarts, having received a letter from Dumbledore asking him to stay at the school for "a few days" to help him the magical defences surrounding the school. Afterwards, he, [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Merula Snyde]] and [[Jacob's sibling]] left for England with their father's [[Flying Ford Anglia]], and arrived just in time to celebrate Christmas Eve at the Weasley household.<ref name="HM2Christmas" />

During the [[1989–1990 school year]], Bill was tasked to retrieve [[Urgruff's Golden Egg|Urgruff's egg]] from the [[Romanian Dragon Sanctuary]]. He divulged this information to Jacob's sibling and several of their friends, who immediately wanted to go with him. They went together using a [[Portkey]], [[Attack at the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary|battled]] [[Hungarian Horntail in the Dragon Sanctuary|a Hungarian Horntail]] and found the egg.<ref name="TDT" /> Shortly afterwards, he agreed to take Jacob's sibling and [[Wilfred Levi Kidd]] on another mission when the latter wanted to become a Curse-Breaker. They managed to retrieve a chest of treasures from a [[Sphinx in the Red Cap's Hole|Sphinx]] in the [[Red Cap's Hole]].<ref name="RCB">{{HM|6|THE RISE OF A CURSE-BREAKER}}</ref>

[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|250px|thumb|The [[Weasley family]] in [[Egypt]]]]
During the [[1990–1991 school year]], Bill was present at Gringotts when Jacob's sibling, [[Merula Snyde]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] came to the bank to investigate the crime scene of an attempted break-in of Sir [[Elric Parpidum]]'s vault.<ref name="HM735">{{HM|7|35}}</ref> The break-in also led to him working overtime breaking curses, so much so that when the [[Unidentified first 1990–1991 Defence Against the Dark Arts professor|Defence Against the Dark Arts professor]] ran off for an unknown reason, he could not fill in for them. Gringotts then sent Bill on a long trip, the destination of which he wouldn't tell Charlie.<ref name="HM740">{{HM|7|40}}</ref> By [[1 September]] [[1991]], however, Bill had gone from travelling back and forth between [[Great Britain]] and foreign countries for his various missions to being stationed permanently in [[Egypt]].<ref name="COS12" />

During the summer of [[1993]], the whole Weasley family went to Egypt on holiday after his [[Arthur Weasley|father]] won seven-hundred galleons in the annual ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' Grand Prize Galleon Draw. Bill took his family on a tour of the Egyptian tombs while they were there.<ref name="POA1">{{POA|B|1}}</ref> While in Egypt the Weasley twins tried to shut Percy in a tomb, but failed when their mother caught them.

[[File:B4C5M1 playing in the garden at the Burrow.png|250px|thumb|left|Bill and Charlie joust with tables at the Burrow]]
In the summer of [[1994]], Bill returned to the Burrow to attend the [[Quidditch World Cup]] with his family. During his stay, he met his youngest brother Ron's best friend, [[Harry Potter]], for the first time.<ref name="GOF5">{{GOF|B|5}}</ref> When the [[Death Eaters]] decided to stir up trouble in the aftermath of the Irish victory, Bill assisted the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. During the skirmish, Bill was injured with a deep cut on his arm.<ref name="GOF9">{{GOF|B|9}}</ref> Bill later escorted his siblings, Harry, and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to King's Cross station to see them off to Hogwarts.<ref name="GOF11">{{GOF|B|11}}</ref>

In [[1995]], Bill took more time off work to travel to Hogwarts with his mother to support Harry during the Third Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. It was during this time that he met [[Fleur Delacour]], who was attracted to him from the start.<ref name="GOF31">{{GOF|B|31}}</ref> Following the death of [[Cedric Diggory]] and the revelation that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned, Bill immediately set out to inform his father of the news, and that [[Albus Dumbledore]] would be contacting him.<ref name="GOF36">{{GOF|B|36}}</ref>

===Second Wizarding War {{C|1995–1998}}===
====Desk job at Gringotts====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-c-b|Harry Potter|Is Bill here? I thought he was working in Egypt.|Fred Weasley|He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order. He says he misses the tombs, but, there are compensations...|What d'you mean?|George Weasley|Remember old [[Fleur Delacour]]?

Bill joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and applied for a desk job in [[England]], so he could help the Order more effectively. Although he missed the tombs, he did have one compensation — Fleur Delacour had taken a part-time job at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] to improve her English, and the two began dating.<ref name="OOTP4">{{OOTP|B|4}}</ref> He was often involved in planning sessions and was used to gauge where the goblins' loyalties lay. During Christmas of 1995, Bill visited his father at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] several times after he had been [[Attack on Arthur Weasley|attacked]] by [[Nagini]].<ref name="OOTP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>

With the Wizarding world at large aware of Lord Voldemort's return in the wake of the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Bill asked Fleur to marry him after they had been dating for a year. In the summer of 1996, she stayed at the Burrow for several weeks to get to know Bill's family. However, her blunt nature rubbed [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] the wrong way, and they thought Bill could do better than her.<ref name="HBP5">{{HBP|B|5}}</ref> Mrs Weasley kept inviting [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] over to the Burrow. Ron thought she was doing this so that Bill would fall for Tonks instead, and Ginny stated that she would "much rather have Tonks in the family".

====Guarding Hogwarts and battling Death Eaters====
{{Quote|Greyback attacked him. [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] says he won't — won't look the same anymore... We don't really know what the aftereffects will be — I mean, Greyback being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time.|Ginny regarding Greyback's attack on Bill|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

In [[June]] [[1997]], Bill was one of the [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]] members tasked by Dumbledore to patrol [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] during his absence when he and Harry went to search for one of Lord Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es. That night, [[Death Eaters]] broke into the school with the help of [[Draco Malfoy]], and during the battle that ensued, Bill was badly injured by the werewolf [[Fenrir Greyback]]. His face was slashed and ripped, and because of the nature of his attacker, the wounds were cursed.<ref name="HBP29">{{HBP|B|29}}</ref>

[[File:Funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|left|[[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore's funeral]] that Bill attended with Fleur and his family]]

Although Greyback was not transformed at the time, the wounds were contaminated. Bill did not become a [[werewolf]] but did develop a liking for very rare steaks. It was his injuries that finally convinced his mother that Fleur was the right choice for him. [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]] thought their union was based on physical attraction, but Fleur showed that she [[love]]d him no matter what he looked like, and the two women reconciled over his hospital bed.<ref>{{HBP|B|29}}</ref> A few days later he attended Dumbledore's funeral, along with his family. He was seen sitting next to Fleur during the service.<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>

[[File:Billfleurdesta.jpg|250px|thumb|Bill and Fleur after the Battle of the Seven Potters|alt=]]

In [[July]] 1997, Bill was one of the members of the Order of the Phoenix who assisted in transporting Harry to safety before the protective charm that kept him safe at the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] was broken. Part of the plan involved Fleur disguising herself as Harry, and the two left [[4 Privet Drive]] on a [[Thestral]]. During the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], Bill saw [[Alastor Moody]] [[Killing Curse|murdered]] personally by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. They were chased by a dozen Death Eaters, but escaped unharmed.<ref name="DH4">{{DH|B|4}}</ref> He later volunteered to assist [[Remus Lupin]] in the search for Moody's body to give him a proper burial, but they could find no trace of it.<ref name="DH5">{{DH|B|5}}</ref>

====Marriage====

[[File:Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Bill and Fleur's wedding]]

Bill and Fleur were married on [[1 August]] [[1997]]. Their reception, however, was disrupted by [[Death Eaters]], who were able to break the protective spells around the Burrow after a successful [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|coup d'état]] against the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and the death of [[Rufus Scrimgeour]].<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref> Although they were questioned, the attendees were free to go. Bill returned to work, and he and Fleur moved to their own place, Shell Cottage. Later in the year, Bill's brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] came to stay with them after abandoning Harry and Hermione during their [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|Horcrux hunt]]. Although disappointed in his brother for his previous actions, he could see just how sorry he was and did not let on to the rest of the family that Ron was at the cottage.<ref name="DH24">{{DH|B|24}}</ref>

[[File:B7C24M1 Dobby's funeral.png|250px|thumb|[[Funeral of Dobby|Dobby's funeral]] in the garden of Shell Cottage]]

After Harry, Ron, and Hermione escaped from [[Malfoy Manor]] with several other prisoners ([[Luna Lovegood]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Griphook]], and [[Garrick Ollivander|Mr Ollivander]]), they took refuge at Shell Cottage. Bill took them in and allowed Harry to bury the remains of [[Dobby]] in his garden. Realising that the enemy was aware that the Weasleys were supporting Harry openly, Bill and his father took the family into hiding using the [[Fidelius Charm]]. As a result, Bill had to give up work, and he became the [[Secret Keeper|Secret-Keeper]] of Shell Cottage. In the following weeks, Bill played host to the escapees and realised that Harry was planning something with Griphook. Although not privy to the details, he counselled Harry on the way goblins perceived things and warned him about them.<ref name="DH25">{{DH|B|25}}</ref>

====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====

[[File:Orderbattle.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Bill and the Order during the Battle of Hogwarts]]

Shortly after Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Griphook left, he was alerted to [[Neville Longbottom]]'s call to arms at Hogwarts, either through the Order of the Phoenix, or the two members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] that were staying with him, Luna and Dean. Either way, he and Fleur Apparated to the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] and travelled to the [[Room of Requirement]]. Bill was one of the Weasley members that didn't want Ginny to fight due to her age. Bill fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and survived, but the victory was tarnished by the death of his brother, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]].<ref name="DH33">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>

===Later life===

Following the war, Bill and Fleur had three children, [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]],<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19959323/ J.K.

She also seemed to have inherited her mother's looks, as she was noted to be good looking. Victoire also seemed to have a relationship with [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]].

As of [[2013]], Bill was still employed as a [[Curse-Breaker]] for [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] and had returned to his work in [[Egypt]].<ref>[http://insider.pottermore.com/2013/11/happy-birthday-bill-weasley.html Happy Birthday, Bill Weasley! - Pottermore Insider]</ref> In [[2014]], Bill attended the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]] final along with the rest of [[Weasley family|his family]].

At some point, Bill had wrote a handbook featuring his experiences with [[Werewolf|werewolves]], which would be used by members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] pursuing an [[Auror]] profession to increase their methods of overpowering a werewolf's defences.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Physical description==
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Molly Weasley|...with a horrible, great fang on it, really, Bill, what do they say at the bank?|Bill|Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn about how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure.|And your hair's getting silly, dear. I wish you'd let me give it a trim...|Discussing regarding Bill's appearance at dinner|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}[[File:B303025b36eb92e5766b5f372ed84c35.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Bill in 1997 after [[Fenrir Greyback]] scarred his face]]
Bill was tall, thin, handsome, and had red hair like the rest of the [[Weasley family]]. He wore it long and in a ponytail, and he had an earring with a fang dangling from it. He wore clothes that, in [[Harry Potter]]'s opinion, would not be out of place at a rock concert, and he favoured boots of [[dragon]] hide. He was once called a "''long-haired pillock''" by [[Rita Skeeter]] in an article about [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] [[Curse-Breaker]]s. However, when Harry first saw Bill, he described him more favourably as "''cool''".

In 1997, he suffered severe facial wounds at the hands of the vicious [[werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]] during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]. Although untransformed at the time, Greyback's [[lycanthropy]] caused the wounds to be cursed. The scars could not be treated totally, leaving Bill heavily scarred. At his wedding, however, he looked so happy one could "''hardly tell he had ever met Fenrir Greyback''" (although this was also aided by a beautifying affect Fleur had on people around her).

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Bill's not that down-to-earth. He's a [[Curse-Breaker]], isn't he, he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour...|Description of Bill's personality|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Bill was laid back and easy going, and described as "''cool''" in both his looks and personality. However, he had a serious side, being a high academic achiever as a student and being Hogwarts [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] his seventh year. He took his studies seriously, as he referenced [[History of Magic]], which normally many students would fall asleep due to the professor, [[Cuthbert Binns]]'s dull style of teaching, during his discussion with Harry regarding [[goblin]]s' ideals of ownership. He was knowledgeable about wizard-goblin relations for his work. Despite being the eldest of seven children, he had a lively sense of humour and knew how to have fun.

He was very brave, working as a [[Curse-Breaker]] and joining the [[Order of the Phoenix]] to fight against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. He was also of great compassion and loyalty, as he was displeased with how Ron would abandon Harry and Hermione over a little argument, but did not pursue the issue seeing Ron's clear regret, and allowed him to stay for the time being. After his mauling at the hands of [[Fenrir Greyback]], it was feared that his personality would change and that he would take on some wolfish characteristics. However, Bill's personality remained intact, although he did develop a liking for very rare steaks.

When Bill met [[Harry Potter]] for the first time in 1994, Harry was taken by surprise at Bill's cool, laid-back demeanour; from everything Harry had heard from Ron, he had always pictured Bill as an older version of [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], who was more serious and stuffy than all his siblings.

==Magical abilities and skills==
Given how Bill earned twelve [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] in his [[fifth year]], and subsequently participated in and survived the [[Second Wizarding War]], he was an accomplished and skilful [[Wizardkind|wizard]] with many [[magic]]al gifts and talents.

*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Bill showed a natural flair for Defence Against the Dark Arts, having earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in the subject.<ref name="OWLS" /> During his time as a student, he would often be found on the school's [[Training Grounds]], practising defensive and offensive [[spell]]s on mechanical Death Eater dummies. As a [[Curse-Breaker|Curse Breaker]], Bill was naturally skilled in [[counter-curse]]s, and his skill was such that both he and [[Albus Dumbledore]] felt that he had much to teach his former schoolmates after his graduation from school, whom he was permitted to visit in between assignments from Gringotts Wizarding Bank in order to tutor them in powerful defensive charms in order to prepare them for any potential encounters they might have with [[Patricia Rakepick]] or for other reasons needed to defend themselves. During the [[1989–1990 school year]], Bill gave extracurricular evening classes in this subject to Hogwarts students, due to the ineffectiveness of the teaching that year, to great success, showing he was also a very skilled teacher of this field.<ref name="HM65" />
*'''[[Arithmancy]]''': Bill earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in this [[Arithmancy (class)|subject]] at Hogwarts,<ref name="OWLS" /> showing proficiency this field. Arithmancy was also a required subject for [[Curse-Breaker]]s, meaning this subject was highly useful for his career.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Bill was shown to be a highly skilful duellist, as evidenced by how, by his fourth year of study at Hogwarts, a fellow fourth year advised [[Jacob's sibling]] to seek him out if they sought to learn how to duel, claiming that the prefect-to-be already then was one of the most accomplished duellists at Hogwarts. As an adult, he participated in and survived numerous battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]] — the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], showing his considerable talent and skill in [[martial magic]].
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Bill was shown to be proficient in this branch of magic, as he was able to swiftly [[Tablecloth-conjuring spell|conjure table cloths]] out of thin air in [[1994]] at [[The Burrow]], as well as successfully using the [[Vanishing Spell]] to vanish a bundle of scrolls whilst cleaning [[12 Grimmauld Place]] in [[1995]]. [[Conjuration]] and [[Vanishment]] are both very advanced forms of transfiguration, showing his competency in this field. He also earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in the [[Transfiguration (class)|subject]] at Hogwarts.<ref name="OWLS" />
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Bill was shown to be proficient with the casting of charms. He could successfully perform everyday charms such as the [[Levitation Charm]], [[Mending Charm]], [[Fire-Making Spell]] and [[Stunning Spell]] without difficulty. He could also cast [[Defensive Charm]]s like the [[Imperturbable Charm]] and ''[[Cave inimicum]]'', and teach the casting of them to others. He was even capable of producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name="LEGOY2" /> a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability and talent, given the immense difficulty of casting such an advanced and powerful protective charm. He also earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in the [[Charms (class)|subject]] at Hogwarts.<ref name="OWLS" />
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Bill earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in this subject at Hogwarts, showing he was skilled with the understanding and handling of [[magic]]al creatures.<ref name="OWLS" /> As he worked for Gringotts as a Curse-Breaker, Bill was very skilful in interacting with [[Goblin]]s and other magical creatrues, such as [[Niffler]]s. He was knowledgeable about wizard-goblin relations for his work, during which he used to gauge where the goblins' loyalties lay, and when he realised that Harry was planning something with Griphook during his hunt for [[Hufflepuff's Cup|Helga Hufflepuff's Cup]], he counselled Harry on the way goblins perceived things and warned him not to betray Griphook. He stated that by goblin standards, the maker of an item such as [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's Sword]], not the purchaser, was the rightful owner and that the item is required to be returned to its maker after the death of the purchaser.
*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Bill was knowledgeable in the field of magical history, as he earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in the subject at Hogwarts,<ref name="OWLS" /> and was particularly well-versed in Goblin history. Bill showed his historical knowledge of Goblins with [[Harry Potter]], when he explained Goblins' ideals of ownership.
*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Bill accomplished the advanced [[magic]]al art of inventing new [[spell]]s, having created a [[William Weasley's modified cursed barrier|modified cursed barrier]] to prevent [[Death Eaters]] from entering a vicinity.<ref name="HM65" />
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Bill was surprisingly skilled with dark magic, as he successfully invented his own [[curse]], a potent [[dark charm]] of the highest severity. His [[William Weasley's modified cursed barrier|modified cursed barrier]] was powerful enough to prevent [[Death Eaters]] from penetrating it, which is very impressive dark magic.<ref name="HM65"/> He was also capable enough with [[dark charm]]s that he was able to teach students in his extra-curricular Defence Against the Dark Arts classes how to perform the [[Ear-shrivelling Curse]],<ref name="HM66">{{HM|6|6|dada}}</ref> ''[[Langlock]]''<ref name="HM610">{{HM|6|10|dada}}</ref> and the [[Sea Urchin Jinx]]<ref name="HM613">{{HM|6|13|dada}}</ref> successfully. He could also perform the [[Conjunctivitis Curse]] successfully.<ref name="HM527">{{HM|5|27}}</ref>
*'''[[Divination]]''': Bill was skilled and knowledgeable in this field, as he gained a high grade O.W.L. in the [[Divination (class)|subject]] at Hogwarts.<ref name="OWLS" />
*'''[[Muggle Studies]]''': Bill earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in this subject at Hogwarts,<ref name="OWLS" /> meaning he was accomplished in this field.
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Bill earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in this subject,<ref name="OWLS" /> meaning he was knowledgeable of magical plants and fungi and how to handle them.
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Bill earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in this [[Potions (class)|subject]] at Hogwarts,<ref name="OWLS" /> meaning he was skilled with the brewing of magical potions.
*'''[[Astronomy]]''': Bill earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in this subject at Hogwarts,<ref name="OWLS" /> meaning he was accomplished and knowledgeable in this field.

==Possessions==
[[File:Bill Weasley wand.png|thumb|Bill's wand]]

*'''[[William Weasley's wand|Wand]]''': The wand of Bill Weasley was of unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] materials. Like most wizards and witches in Great Britain, he likely purchased it at the age of eleven at [[Ollivanders]] before beginning his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].
*'''[[Prefect badge]]''': Having been made prefect in his [[fifth year]] at Hogwarts, Bill owned a Gryffindor prefect badge, which he wore during his formal prefect duties.
*'''[[Head Boy or Girl badge|Head Boy badge]]''': Bill was awarded one of these special badges when he was made [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] at Hogwarts, for which he would have worn during his formal duties.
*'''[[Shell Cottage]]''': Bill purchased and became the owner of this beachfront cottage in [[Tinworth]], [[Cornwall]], where he lived with his wife [[Fleur Delacour]], and also used his house as a safe house for the [[Order of the Phoenix]].

==Relationships==
===Family===
====Weasley family====
[[File:Weasley family.png|250px|thumb|The [[Weasley family]]]]
Bill had a good relationship with all his family members but seemed to be particularly close to [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], the sibling closest to him in age and the one he chose as best man at his wedding.

Bill's younger siblings tended to look up to him, especially his only sister, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. She supported Bill whenever their mother criticised his choice of hair and clothing, and a large part of her initial disdain for [[Fleur Delacour]] was her belief that the witch was not good enough for her brother. It is unclear whether Ginny ever made her dislike for Fleur known to Bill, but she eventually accepted their relationship. Ginny also tended to take Bill's opinion very seriously; when she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were discussing their hatred of Snape, she mentioned "''Bill doesn't like him either''," as if her older brother's opinion should settle it. 

[[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] also admired Bill, partly because he was the only one of his siblings who did not tease him. Towards the end of [[1997]], when Ron temporarily abandoned [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] during their search for Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es, he stayed with Bill and Fleur at [[Shell Cottage]]. Although Bill was not impressed by his brother's actions, he realised how sorry Ron was about it and never mentioned it. 

Normally, [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] did look up to Bill, but when Percy had a falling out with his family due to conflict of belief over the return of Lord Voldemort, Percy cut all ties with his family, Bill included, and was the only sibling not to attend Bill's wedding despite being issued an invitation.

Bill also got along well with his parents, though [[Molly Weasley|his mother]] constantly tried to pressure him into cutting his hair and not dressing as flashily as he liked to. She also disapproved of his choice of wife initially, though she came to accept Fleur once she realised how in love the couple was and their liking of one another was not based on looks as she had first believed.

Bill fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in [[1998]] with the rest of his family. He was devastated by his younger brother Fred's death and was seen comforting his wife Fleur in the Great Hall.

Bill also became the uncle to many Weasleys, through his brothers. He also had two Potter nephews and one Potter niece, through Ginny's marriage to [[Harry Potter]], Bill's brother-in-law.

====Fleur Delacour====
{{Dialogue a-b|George Weasley|Remember old Fleur Delacour?  She's got a job at Gringotts to "''eemprove 'er Eeenglish''" —|Fred Weasley|And Bill's been giving her a lot of private lessons.|[[Fred and George Weasley]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Fleur Delacour.jpg|175px|thumb|left|[[Fleur Delacour]], his wife and future mother of his children]] 
Bill met [[Fleur Delacour]] in June [[1995]], when he accompanied his mother to Hogwarts to support Harry Potter during the Third Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], in which she was also a Champion. Fleur was attracted to him immediately, eyeing him from a distance.

Shortly after, Bill moved back to England to work for the [[Order of the Phoenix]], taking a desk job at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]]. Fleur had taken a part-time job at the bank to improve her English, and the two began dating shortly after. After a year together Bill proposed and Fleur accepted. His [[Molly Weasley|mother]] felt it was too soon for him to get married and worried that he was only doing it in response to the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. In addition, Fleur's blunt attitude and tendency to speak her mind irritated both Molly and Ginny. Mrs Weasley became convinced that their feelings for each other were based on physical attraction and the adventurous side of each other — him as a Curse Breaker, and her as a [[Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Champion]].  

Following Bill's scarring during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], Fleur showed her feelings for Bill by declaring that she still [[love]]d him no matter what he looked like, and her insistence that she would take care of his injuries. Her declaration convinced Mrs Weasley that her son had made the right choice, and the two women finally put aside their differences. Bill and Fleur married on [[1 August]] [[1997]] and set up a home of their own, [[Shell Cottage]].  

Due to Fleur's declaration that she didn't care about his looks due to his scarring by Greyback, it served to indicate that she was attracted to Bill's courage, intelligence, and adventurous personality, as well as his interest in other cultures, which likely served to bridge the cultural gap between them. 

====Children====
After the Second Wizarding War, Bill and Fleur had three children; [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]] and [[Louis Weasley|Louis]].<ref name="WFT" /> It is likely he had a good relationship with all of them. In 2017, Victoire was seen snogging [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]]. Bill did develop a rather protective streak in regards to his eldest daughter, as he tactically interrupted her and Teddy's conversation during the Quidditch World Cup of 2014, much to the dismay of the teenagers' budding romance. 

====Harry Potter====
[[File:Harry Potter.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], his friend and future brother-in-law]]
Bill first met Harry Potter in 1994, around the time of the [[Quidditch World Cup]]. Harry found Bill cool, but he expected Bill to be like an older version of [[Percy Weasley]] and was surprised and grateful to learn that he was not. Harry was Ron's best friend and Bill was sometimes like an older brother for Harry, as well.

Bill and his mother visited Hogwarts in 1995, during the [[Triwizard Tournament]], at the time Harry was taking part in his third task. Harry was very glad to see them because he did not expect anyone to come to watch him. Bill also stuck by Harry's side in the [[Hospital Wing]] after the Third Task and "''Harry saw Mrs Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him''", showing that he cared for Harry's well-being.

Bill and Harry fought together in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]. After the battle, Harry was shocked when he learned about Bill's injuries from [[Fenrir Greyback]]. He participated in Bill and Fleur's wedding and later stayed for a short time at their house, [[Shell Cottage]]. Bill also advised Harry not to attempt to deceive goblins. They also fought together in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and survived the war.

After the [[Second Wizarding War]], they became brothers-in-law. Harry married Bill's younger sister (Ginny Weasley). Bill also had two nephews ([[James Potter II|James Sirius]] and [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]]) and one niece ([[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna]]) through Harry's marriage to Ginny.

====Hermione Granger====
[[File:Hermione Granger.jpg|175px|thumb|left|[[Hermione Granger]], his future sister-in-law]]
Bill met Hermione Granger in the summer of 1994, prior to Hermione's fourth year at Hogwarts. Although they were not very close, Hermione seemed to like Bill and the fact that he was a top student, which she heard from Ron and Percy. Hermione fought alongside Bill at the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]; after the battle, Hermione visited Bill at Hogwarts' hospital wing, while she, members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and others discussed Dumbledore's death at the hands of [[Severus Snape]]. Hermione participated at the wedding of Bill and Fleur, and she later stayed for a short time at their house. Bill was upset when he heard that Hermione had been tortured by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. 

After the Second Wizarding War, Hermione became Bill's sister-in-law, as she married his youngest brother (Ron Weasley). Bill also had a niece ([[Rose Granger-Weasley]]) and a nephew ([[Hugo Granger-Weasley]]) through Hermione's marriage to Ron.

====Nieces and nephews====
Bill also had several nieces and nephews through his siblings; [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]] and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]], Percy's children; [[Fred Weasley II|Fred]] and [[Roxanne Weasley|Roxanne]], George's children; [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]], Ron's children; [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]], Ginny's children. He possibly had a good relationship with them, too.

===Order of the Phoenix===
[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250px|thumb|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]
Bill became a member of the Order of the Phoenix in [[1995]], after Voldemort's return. He had a good relationship with the most fellow members. He seemed to like [[Albus Dumbledore]], who was his headmaster at the time Bill attended Hogwarts. Bill was loyal to Dumbledore, and fought for him at the [[Second Wizarding War]], after Dumbledore's death.

He seemed to be a friend of [[Remus Lupin]], as they fought together in several battles of the Second War. After the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], they both left the Burrow in order to search for [[Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]]'s dead body. When Lupin was killed during the Battle of Hogwarts, his body was put near Fred's. It is possible that Bill cried for Lupin, too.

He was also friendly with [[Alastor Moody]]. In [[1997]], Moody was the leader of a group that escorted Harry Potter to a safe place. However, Moody was killed. Bill, along with Fleur, was the one to witness his friend's death by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and tell about it to the others, as well.

Bill also appeared to be on good terms with [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Bill and Tonks fought together in many battles and were close in age; Bill was also one of the first to learn about her childbirth.

He was also friendly with [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]. They fought together at many battles, such as the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. They both survived the war; Kingsley became [[Minister for Magic]].

[[Minerva McGonagall]] appeared to be on good terms with Bill's family. She was Bill's head of house and Transfiguration professor. They both participated at the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and, after the battle, she visited Bill at the hospital, and they discussed Dumbledore and Snape.

It was stated by [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] that Bill did not like [[Severus Snape]]. After Snape killed Albus Dumbledore, Bill was angry with Snape; however, he learned that Snape was on their side and that Dumbledore had asked Snape to kill him. It is unknown how he reacted.

Though most members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] were killed by [[Death Eaters]]. Bill and most of his family were among the few others who managed to survive.

===Emily Tyler===
[[File:Emily Tyler.jpg|175px|thumb|left|[[Emily Tyler]], his childhood crush]]
Emily thought she was superior to Bill Weasley and his family, and considered him "ill-mannered" and "completely delusional" if he ever thought he had a chance with dating her. He was in [[love]] with her, but she considered the news "a good laugh".<ref name="Y3sq" />

==Etymology==
The name "William" comes from the Germanic name Wilhelm, which was composed of the elements wil "will, desire" and helm "helmet, protection".

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Bill Weasley LEGO.png|thumb|Bill Weasley as he appears in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]

*Bill is the first identified victim of an un-transformed werewolf in [[canon]]. He is certainly not the first ''ever'', as Remus Lupin was able to correctly diagnose what changes Bill would experience from the contaminated injuries from the attack. This indicates that there have been other victims of this kind of more subdued infection prior to Bill's maiming. Lupin, being a werewolf himself, would likely be more familiar with these type of injuries than most. [[Molly Weasley]]'s fears that Bill would face worse symptoms and stigma indicates that this may not be common knowledge. Alternately this may simply be another example of Molly's continual fears for the well being of her family.

[[File:Bill's clothing item.jpg|175px|thumb|A Weasley jumper in {{HM}}]]

*In {{HM}}, Bill is unlocked as a friend upon the completion of Chapter 6 of Year 2.
**Upon reaching maximum friendship at level 10 with Bill, a unique clothing item is gifted to the player: a [[Weasley jumper]].
*In the side quest "Career Advice", for Bill's career choice, other than [[Curse-Breaker]], the player ([[Jacob's sibling]]) can choose [[Magizoologist]], [[Herbologist]], or [[Auror]], which would be the actual path chosen given that he later gained all 7 [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]s in the game (not including Arithmacy), but this option can only be picked if their friendship level is at least a level 2. However, it is a requirement to then reach maximum level of friendship with Bill before continuing with the side quest. Other career paths explored include [[Magizoologist]], [[Potioneer]], [[Herbologist]], and [[Herbology]] [[professor]]. Upon failing all three, Bill steeled his resolve to become a Curse-Breaker.
*In {{HM}}, [[Jacob's sibling]] would gift Bill a book about the famous [[Curse-Breaker]] [[Patricia Rakepick]] upon first meeting him, only if option ''"I'll bring a gift"'' is chosen when asked about how to approach Bill for help.<ref name="y2ch5" />
*Bill is portrayed by [[England|English]] actor [[Richard Fish]] in {{POA|FA}} and [[Ireland|Irish]] actor [[Domhnall Gleeson]], son of [[Brendan Gleeson]], in {{DH|F1}} and {{DH|F2}}. In the video game ''Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery'', Bill is voiced by American voice actor [[Chris Okawa]].
**In the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|third film]], he only appeared in a photo of the [[Weasley family]] in [[Egypt]].
**Bill was omitted from the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'', but appeared in the adaptations of ''The Deathly Hallows''.
*The first time Bill meets Harry Potter in the books is in ''[[Goblet of Fire]]'', but in the movies he meets him in the film adaptation of {{DH|F1}}.
*Despite Bill not being attacked or even appearing in the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', it is simply explained in {{DH|F1}} that he was attacked by a [[werewolf]] named [[Fenrir Greyback]].
*Domhnall Gleeson's favourite line as Bill was "Mad-Eye's dead," as his father, Brendan Gleeson, portrays Mad-Eye Moody.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3FP-nmkFL0 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' Press Conference]</ref>
*Coincidentally, [[Domhnall Gleeson]] portrays Bill in the Harry Potter series, as he is described as having a close resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody (due to the deep scars inflicted to his face by [[Fenrir Greyback]]), who is played by Domhnall's father [[Brendan Gleeson|Brendan]] in the film adaptations. Following Fenrir's attack, Bill is described as follows: "His scars were as bad as ever; in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs still intact."
