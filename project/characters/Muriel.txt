{{Quote|Nightmare, Muriel is.|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], describing Muriel's unpleasantness|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

'''Muriel''' (born c. [[1890]]) was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood|pure]] or [[half-blood]] Thus she was the great-great aunt of the [[Weasley family#Molly and Arthur Weasley's Family|Weasley children]], much to their dismay, as Muriel loved to gossip and was generally rude and unpleasant to be around.

==Biography==
===Early life {{c|late 1800s-1899}}===
Muriel was born sometime between [[31 July]], [[1889]] and [[2 August]], [[1890]] to [[Muriel's mother|a woman]] who was good friends with [[Bathilda Bagshot]]. Her surname is unknown; it may be [[Prewett family|Prewett]], but only if she is related to [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] on her father's side.

During her youth, Muriel eavesdropped on a conversation between her [[Muriel's mother|mother]] and [[Bathilda Bagshot]], listening in secretly from behind a door. She learned that the [[Dumbledore family|Dumbledore]] brothers had an altercation at their sister Ariana's funeral.

===Second Wizarding War {{c|1997-1998}}===
{{Quote|...and your hair's much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginevra]]. Merlin's beard, what is [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] wearing? He looks like an omelette... Isn't [[Harry Potter]] here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?|Muriel's unpleasant demeanour|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Muriel allowed the [[Order of the Phoenix]] to use her [[Muriel's house|home]] as a safe house during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Muriel attended to the pair upon their arrival there.

Muriel owned a [[goblin]]-made [[Muriel's tiara|tiara]] which she claimed had been in her family for centuries. After being persuaded by her great-niece, [[Molly Weasley]], she lent the tiara to [[Fleur Delacour]], who wore it at her wedding to Molly's son, [[William Weasley|Bill]].

[[File:HarryMurielDoge1.jpg|252x252px|thumb|left|Harry Potter, Elphias Doge and Muriel sitting at Bill and Fleur's wedding in 1997]]

Muriel was also invited to the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]], but was a rather unpleasant presence, drinking copious amounts of [[champagne]] and belittling the other guests. At the wedding, she also interrupted a conversation [[Elphias Doge]] and [[Harry Potter]] (disguised as "Barny Weasley") were having about [[Albus Dumbledore]], which she had overheard as she was walking past. Muriel and Doge proceeded to have a heated argument regarding Dumbledore. Doge, being a childhood friend of Albus, defended him passionately from the claims Muriel argued with that were based on evidence supplied by [[Rita Skeeter]]'s new book, ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'' and what she had heard [[Bathilda Bagshot]] tell her [[Muriel's mother|mother]].

In early [[1998]], Muriel allowed most of the [[Weasley family]] to take refuge in her house, as they had become targets of the [[Death Eaters]]. [[Fred and George Weasley]], unable to run their [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|shop]] in [[Diagon Alley]], began selling their products by owl out of Muriel's back room, much to her chagrin. She also took in [[Garrick Ollivander]], who returned the tiara to her, at [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s request. She may have possibly owned Shell Cottage before [[William Weasley|Bill]] and Fleur.

==Physical appearance==
At age one hundred and seven, Muriel had a beaky nose, red-rimmed, bloodshot eyes, and bony fingers. She wore a feathery pink hat that was described as giving her the appearance of a "bad-tempered flamingo."

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Ron Weasley|Wow. You look great!|Hermione Granger|Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn't agree. I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the [[Muriel's tiara|tiara]]. She said, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?' and then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles'.|Don't take it personally, she's rude to everyone.|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] in [[1997]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Muriel was a loud, ill-mannered, and extremely rude woman who was able to find fault with everything and everyone. When she insulted [[Hermione Granger]] in 1997 for having "bad posture and skinny ankles" and rudely referred to her as a Muggle-born, Ron urged her not to take it personally, since Muriel was rude to everybody. Among her other insulting remarks were that [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] looked "like an omelette" in his yellow robes, that Ron's long hair made him nearly indistinguishable from his sister, that George's ears were "lopsided" after his right ear had been magically cut off, and that [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]'s dress was "far too low cut." Based on her insult to Hermione, she may have disliked Hermione's [[Muggle-born]] status Muriel liked to use her advanced age as a justification for her impolite actions, in spite of the fact that she seemed quite strong for her age.

Muriel enjoyed gossip and was a fan of poison-pen journalist [[Rita Skeeter]], stating that she "always" read Rita's work, and that she was eager to pre-order a copy of her book ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]].'' She was also shown to use Skeeter's points as fact and parts of her arguments, for example when she was arguing about Albus Dumbledore she brought up points made in Skeeter's book.

Despite her rude behaviour, Muriel did have a soft side, as she lent her goblin-forged tiara to Fleur for her wedding with Bill despite an implied dislike of her and, more importantly, when the Weasley family was in danger of being arrested by Death Eaters, she allowed them to hide in her home.

==Relationships==
===Weasley family===
{{Quote|Another Weasley? You breed like [[gnome]]s.|Muriel upon her introduction to "[[Harry Potter|Barny Weasley]]"|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|230px|thumb|The Weasley family holidaying in [[Egypt]]]]
Muriel was not fond of her great-[[Molly Weasley|niece]]'s family, the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], but nonetheless opened her home to them when they were in danger. She came to [[the Burrow]] for dinner every Christmas until [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] set off a [[Dungbomb]] under her chair. She likely wrote them both out of her will for this stunt. According to Molly Weasley, however, Muriel had a soft spot for [[William Weasley|Bill]]. It seems she had a distant relationship with Ron and Ginny, as she seemed to insult Ron a lot, and only called Ginny by her given name rather than her preferred nickname. She also disapproved of her great-great niece's dress at the wedding, thinking it was inappropriate.

==Etymology==
The name "Muriel" is the Medieval English form of a Celtic name which was probably related to the Irish name Muirgel. It was brought to England from Brittany by the Normans. In the modern era, it was popularised by a character from Dinah Craik's novel, ''John Halifax, Gentleman ''(1856). It is also of Gaelic origin.

==Behind the scenes==
*Muriel was played by [[Matyelok Gibbs]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|film adaptations]] of {{DH}}.
*In {{DH|F1}}, Muriel's scene is much smaller than in the book, and it is not introduced as to who she is.
*She has some similarities to Harry’s aunt Marge, although they obviously have differences: for example, Muriel was a witch and Marge was not.
