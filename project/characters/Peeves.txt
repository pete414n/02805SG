{{Quote|Peeves is the most notorious and troublesome poltergeist in British history. Unlike the overwhelming majority of his colleagues, Peeves has a physical form, though he is able to become invisible at will. His looks reflect his nature, which those who know him would agree is a seamless blend of humour and malice.|Description of Peeves and his traits|Pottermore}}
'''Peeves''' was a [[poltergeist]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], since c. [[First millennium A.D.|993]]. Fond of mischief and chaos, he was a constant pain to the school and its inhabitants, especially [[Argus Filch]], the [[Hogwarts Caretaker|caretaker]], as the only ones able to control him were the [[Bloody Baron]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Though, he had taken into account students like [[Fred and George Weasley]] and help them with their chaos. 

In [[1995]], Peeves, along with most of the Hogwarts residents, opposed [[Dolores Umbridge]], the High Inquisitor, and pranked her until she skedaddled at the end of the school year. In [[1998]], Peeves fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. After the [[Second Wizarding War]], Peeves continued making trouble at Hogwarts.

==Biography==
===Founding of Hogwarts===
Peeves has lived at [[Hogwarts Castle]] since its founding in c. [[First millennium A.D.|993]]. He "came with the building", and came into existence with the founding of an institution containing a large number of children. Whilst unconfirmed, it was guessed that Peeves is a tangible manifestation of the students' mischief. Peeves has wrought havoc upon Hogwarts for centuries, and was often the cause of ire for various teachers and staff. Starting with [[Hankerton Humble]], who was appointed by the Founders themselves, Peeves has traditionally been a pet peeve of every [[Hogwarts Caretaker|caretaker]] the school has seen.

===[[1876]]===
In 1876, caretaker [[Rancorous Carpe]] devised an "[[Rancorous Carpe's trap|elaborate trap]]" in an effort to remove Peeves from the [[Hogwarts Castle|Castle]]. The trap comprised a bait of assortment of weapons and a vast enchanted bell jar, reinforced by various [[Containment Charm]]s, which he intended to drop over the poltergeist once he was in place. This did not go as planned, as Peeves easily broke through the bell jar and was left armed with several cutlasses, crossbows, a [[blunderbuss]] and a miniature cannon. The Castle had to be evacuated for three days as Peeves amused himself by firing randomly and threatening the students with death.

[[Eupraxia Mole|Professor Eupraxia Mole]], Headmistress of the day, agreed to sign a [[Peeves's contract|contract]] with Peeves, so that he relinquished the weapons in exchange for additional privileges (a once-weekly swim in the boys' toilets on the ground floor, first choice on stale bread from the [[Hogwarts kitchens|kitchens]] for throwing purposes, and a new custom-made hat by [[Bonhabille|Madame Bonhabille]]). This was the last and most disastrous attempt to get rid of Peeves. These events forced Mr Carpe to take early retirement "for health reasons".

===[[1980s]]-[[1990s]]===
Throughout the 1980s, Peeves would frequently disrupt [[Flying (class)|Flying classes]] by mixing the [[Broomstick|brooms]] with the mops, which [[Jacob's sibling]] in particular would help to rearrange. He would also sometimes disrupt [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]]'s [[History of Magic]] lessons in the [[History of Magic Classroom]] to ask students questions about making mischief.

During the [[1986–1987 school year]], [[Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington]] told [[Jacob's sibling]] in the [[Great Hall]] one day that he had to prevent Peeves from throwing [[Severus Snape]]'s [[soup]] bowl.

[[File:Peeves giving Jacob's sibling his self-portrait HM522.png|250px|thumb|left|Peeves offering Jacob's sibling a portrait of himself in the [[Prefects' Bathroom]]]]
Peeves stole the [[vault portrait]] in the 1980s. During the [[1988–1989 school year]], [[Jacob's sibling]] had to find him for the portrait, and asked various ghosts in Hogwarts about where he could be. When they found him and asked for the portrait, Peeves [[Plan to obtain the vault portrait|demanded some chaos]] in exchange. They created some minor chaos, and Peeves responded by attempting to give them [[Peeves's self-portrait|his self-portrait]] and saying they had to create a mischief masterpiece to win over the vault portrait. Jacob's sibling and their friends carefully planned out [[Plan to obtain the vault portrait|a series of mischief]] and presented it to Peeves, who finally gave them the portrait.

[[File:Victor and Jacob's sibling summoning Peeves HM734.png|250px|thumb|right|Victor Ketsueki and Jacob's sibling seeking out Peeves in his room]]
During the [[1990–1991 school year]], [[Victor Ketsueki]] summoned him with Jacob's sibling in his room, asking him where to find [[Victor Ketsueki's coffin|coffin]], which contained the [[Dark Scroll]]. Peeves lamented Victor neglecting to visit him often, given how he had become a "popular [[vampire]]", and Victor expressed his apologies that they would spend more time together causing mischief. He then revealed that [[Fred and George Weasley]] had agreed with him to steal Victor's coffin as a prank, but that the twins had failed to show up with the coffin, so the two went to find them.

===[[1991–1992 school year]]===
{{Quote|My dear [[Fat Friar|Friar]], haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost.|[[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]] discussing Peeves with his fellow ghosts|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Peeves was a topic of discussion before the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] of [[1991]]. Hogwarts' ghosts debated whether or not Peeves should be allowed to attend the feast. While the [[Fat Friar]] was willing to give Peeves another chance, [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]] felt Peeves did not deserve to be even considered; ghosts had been given a bad name because of him.

After the Start-of-Term Feast, Peeves appeared to torment prefect [[Percy Weasley]] as he led the [[Gryffindor]] first years to [[Gryffindor Tower]]. Peeves threw walking sticks at the [[prefect]], disregarded Percy's threat to tell the Bloody Baron, responded by blowing a raspberry, dumped even more walking sticks onto [[Neville Longbottom]]'s head and left. Peeves wrote rude words on a classroom blackboard when [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] surprised Harry with the position of Gryffindor Seeker.

{{Quote|STUDENTS OUT OF BED! STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!|Peeves antagonising first year students out of bed at night|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Hogwarts Attic.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Peeves speaking with first year Harry Potter]]
Later in the year, Peeves caught [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Neville Longbottom]] sneaking around the school after curfew. He teased them and then loudly alerted Filch to their presence in the halls. However, once Filch arrived, Peeves did nothing but antagonise him. In [[October]], Ron suspected Peeves to have been the one who released the [[Troll in the Bathroom|Mountain Troll]] on [[Hallowe'en]] but in truth, it turned out that [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] had done it.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione once again encountered Peeves in the hallways during their quest to save the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. Without Peeves' knowledge, the three of them were concealed under Harry's [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]] from which Harry impersonated the [[Bloody Baron]], warning Peeves to stay away from the third floor that night, which was sufficient enough to frighten him away and avoid being caught by them, during their mission.

===[[1992–1993 school year]]===
{{Quote|ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! ATTAAACK!|Peeves after the attacks on Sir Nicholas and Justin Finch-Fletchley|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Deathday Party Pottermore.png|250px|thumb|Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday party]]
In the autumn of [[1992]], Peeves crashed a vanishing cabinet over Filch's office, after being persuaded by [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]], saving Harry from one of Filch's punishments. Wearing a bright orange party hat and a revolving bow tie, Peeves attended Nearly-Headless Nick's [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|deathday party]], where he appeared to be civilised, even though he taunted [[Hermione Granger]] for gossiping about [[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]]. He later pelted mouldy peanuts at Myrtle, mocking her spots.

Some time later, Peeves appeared in a hallway with Harry, where he noticed the two new [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]] victims, [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and Nearly Headless Nick. He loudly alerted the faculty and students of Hogwarts of the attack. He performed a song to taunt Harry over the fact that students thought he was the one releasing Slytherin's monster and petrifying the muggle-born students. Peeves soon added a dance routine for the song.

===[[1993–1994 school year]]===
{{Quote|Nasty temper he's got, that Sirius Black.|Peeves to [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:FatLadyPortrait PM B3C8M2FatLadyPortraitSlashedWithStudentsTeachersAndPeevesCrowdedAround Moment.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Peeves floats above the students after Sirius Black's first attempt to break into Gryffindor Tower]]
In 1993, Peeves appeared before Remus Lupin and his [[third year]] [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class when they were entering the teacher's lounge for a practical lesson. Peeves stuffed a keyhole with chewing gum when he noticed Remus. He began singing the phrase "Loony, loopy Lupin" over and over again. Professor Lupin asked him to remove the gum, but Peeves' only response was a loud raspberry. To this, Remus cast a simple spell, ''[[Projectile Jinx|Waddiwasi]]'', which shot the gum up Peeves' nose.

On [[31 October]], Peeves informed [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] of the [[Fat Lady]]'s location after her portrait was attacked. He also revealed that her attacker was the escaped prisoner, [[Sirius Black]]. At half past four in the morning, Peeves woke [[Harry Potter]] up by blowing in his ear, disregarding the fact that the Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff Quidditch match was to be that day.

Peeves was shown on the Marauder's Map to entertain himself by bouncing around the trophy room. He also displayed quite an amount of glee at the prospect of the [[Dementor]]s using the "[[Dementor's kiss|Kiss]]" on [[Sirius Black]].

===[[1994–1995 school year]]===
{{Dialogue a-b-c-d|Argus Filch|It's Peeves, professor! He threw this egg down the stairs.|Severus Snape|Peeves? But Peeves couldn't get into my office.|Argus Flich|This egg was in your office, professor?|Severus Snape|Of course not!|Argus Flich and Severus Snape, discussing that Peeves stole Harry's Triwizard Champion egg|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}} 
His first appearance was before the welcoming feast in the entrance hall, where he dropped [[water balloons]] on the students. During the feast, Gryffindor ghost [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]] stated that Peeves was enraged at being unable to attend the feast, as decided via [[ghost's council]], and therefore had caused havoc and mayhem in the kitchens, terrorising the [[House-elf|house-elves]].

When Harry was practising the [[Summoning Charm]] with Hermione, Peeves appeared and started chucking chairs across the room under the pretence that Harry wanted things thrown at him.

Around the time of the [[Yule Ball]], Peeves frequently hid in a suit of armour and sang rude songs, and was also accused of stealing Harry's [[golden egg]] the night Harry worked out the clue.

===[[1995–1996 school year]]===
{{Quote|Oh, most think he's barking, the Potty wee lad,<br/> But some are more kindly and think he’s just sad,<br/> But Peevesy knows better and says that he's mad —|Peeves singing a disparaging song about Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Peeves salutes Weasley twins' departure - PM.png|250px|thumb|Peeves saluting the twins]]
After Harry Potter's first [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson with [[Dolores Umbridge]], Peeves began tormenting Harry in the corridor outside of the [[Classroom 3C|classroom]], much to Harry's anger. That year, Peeves orchestrated a prank to knock the bust of [[Phillipus von Hohenheim|Paracelsus]] on top of any student which passed it; [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]] alerted Harry to avoid this, and went to find the [[Bloody Baron]] in order for him to put a stop to it.

Peeves was in the classroom where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were situated shortly after conversing with Sirius about forming [[Dumbledore's Army]]. He threw ink pellets at the trio and others, including [[Katie Bell]], over whom he emptied an ink bottle. At [[Christmas]] in [[1995]], Peeves caused trouble whilst Hermione and Ron attempted to put up Christmas decorations as part of their [[Prefect]] duties, by attempting to strangle Ron with [[tinsel]]. Peeves was not completely without loyalties, though; during [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s attempts to take control of Hogwarts in [[1996]], he showed respect for his fellow troublemakers, [[Fred and George Weasley]]. When given final instructions by Fred and George just before they left Hogwarts, Peeves saluted the twins, marking possibly the first time he had knowingly and willingly obeyed a Hogwarts student.

[[File:B5C30 Peeves chasing Umbridge.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Peeves chasing Umbridge with McGonagall's cane]]
After the Weasley twins' departure, Peeves began a rampage of ceaseless mayhem by juggling burning torches over students, dumping a bag of [[tarantula]]s in the [[Great Hall]], twice locking [[Mrs Norris]] in a suit of armour (much to Filch's great displeasure) and destroying property like never before. It appears that Peeves was actually on friendly terms with the strict [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] during this time, due to their mutual disdain for Umbridge. Professor McGonagall went as far as telling Peeves that he was unscrewing a chandelier the wrong way,

===[[1996–1997 school year]]===
{{Quote|[[Harry Potter|Potty]] asked [[Luna Lovegood|Loony]] to go to the [[Slug Club Christmas party|party]]! Potty [[Love|lurves]] Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony!|Peeves|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
When [[Harry Potter|Harry]] asked [[Luna Lovegood]] to attend [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s [[Slug Club Christmas party|party]], Peeves overheard and started singing a song of his own composition describing the situation.

Shortly after the Apparition lessons, Peeves blocked a door to the Gryffindor Common Room, and wouldn't let anyone pass unless they set fire to their own pants. Only Neville Longbottom fell prey to this prank.

[[File:B6C19 Peeves Dobby Kreacher Hospital Wing.png|250px|thumb|Kreacher and Dobby fight, while being encouraged by Peeves]]
During 1996, when [[Harry Potter]] was admitted to the hospital wing after suffering a cracked skull when [[Cormac McLaggen]] hit him with a bludger, Harry summoned [[Kreacher]] to have him tail [[Draco Malfoy]] around the castle. Kreacher apparated there along with [[Dobby]], with whom he was fighting after Kreacher insulted Harry Potter. A moment later Peeves apparated, saying that he was watching the fight. Then Peeves egged them on verbally, then threw chalk at them to enrage them further. He only left when Harry used ''[[Langlock]]'' to glue Peeves' tongue to the roof of his mouth.

In [[April]] [[1997]], after attending the burial of [[Aragog]] and getting an important memory from [[Horace Slughorn]], Harry Potter could feel the effects of [[Felix Felicis]] wearing off as he escaped back into the castle. He encountered Peeves but managed to escape detection by taking a shortcut. It is unknown if Peeves attended Dumbledore's funeral. 

===[[1997–1998 school year]]===
====Battle of Hogwarts====
{{Quote|We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter's the one, and Voldy's gone mouldy, so now let's have fun!|Peeves after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s death|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|left|Peeves witnesses Voldemort's final defeat at the hands of Harry Potter]]
During the Battle of Hogwarts in [[1998]], [[Argus Filch|Filch]] (albeit forcibly and only after he was persuaded by [[Minerva McGonagall]]) invited Peeves to take part in the defence of the castle. Despite his long career of mischief and disregard for school authorities, Peeves rose valiantly to the occasion, willingly joining in the effort to protect Hogwarts. When [[Death Eaters]] breached the school itself, Peeves sowed chaos in their ranks by swooping over their heads, dropping [[Snargaluff]] pods on them as he went. He did nothing to bother or distract the defenders of Hogwarts, his usual targets for as long as he had existed at the school. After the battle, he flew amongst the survivors, singing a victory song.

==Physical appearance==
[[File:Peeves.png|thumb|Peeves' phsyical form]]
Unlike the overwhelming majority of his [[ghost]]ly colleagues, Peeves had a physical form, though he was able to become [[Invisibility|invisible]] at will.

Peeves looked like a little man with wickedly slanted, orange eyes, dressed in loud, outlandish clothes including a bell-covered hat and an orange bow tie. He had black hair and compared to the Hogwarts ghosts, he was solid-looking, not pearly white and transparent. He was capable of flight and intangibility, like a ghost, but could also affect solid objects and make himself invisible. Unlike the [[ghost]]s, he could be affected by [[magic]], as Harry used ''[[Langlock]]'' to silence him.

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Peeves|Why, it's Potty Wee Potter!|Harry Potter|Get out of it, Peeves.|Oooh, Crackpot's feeling cranky. What is it this time, my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions? Speaking in --- ''[[Parseltongue|tongues]]''?|Peeves annoying and taunting Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:PeevesWU.png|250px|thumb|left|Peeves giving a mischeivous smile]]
Peeves was more of a chaotic [[spirit]] rather than a physical being, but highly different from the other school [[ghost]]s. Peeves was essentially an embodiment of disorder and took great pleasure in constantly causing it. At times, Peeves could be legitimately dangerous. Hogwarts caretaker [[Argus Filch]] waged a constant war with Peeves, and year after year requested the poltergeist be thrown out of the school.

Peeves further annoyed and bothered the Hogwarts community by joining in with whatever current gossip was circulating among students. When [[Harry Potter]] was suspected of being the "Heir of [[Salazar Slytherin|Slytherin]]" in 1992, Peeves taunted him in the hallways for "speaking in tongues." If students were late to class, he would, among other things, drop wastepaper baskets on their heads, pelt them with [[chalk]], or pull the rugs out from under them. The worst case involved him sneaking up invisible, grabbing the person's nose and screeching "GOT YOUR CONK!".

{{Quote|Oooooooh! Ickle Firsties! What fun!|Peeves tormenting first years|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Peeves was shown to be able to create food at will out of thin air. This ability of his was shown when [[Jacob's sibling]] was trying to get Peeves to give him the vault portrait. Since this broke one of [[Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration]], this might mean that Peeves might have had otherworldly powers. However, despite this, he did not seem to have the power to oppose tremendously powerful wizards, as he was shown to be unwilling to challenge the notoriously powerful Dumbledore.

{{Quote|So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr Baron, sir. My mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.|Peeves' fear of the Bloody Baron|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Peeves did not heed commands from Hogwarts [[prefect]]s or professors, though Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] was an exception. The one Hogwarts ghost that struck fear in Peeves, in addition to controlling him, was the [[Bloody Baron]]. His fear of the Baron was so well known that in his first year [[Harry Potter]], under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]], was able to drive him away by pretending to be the Baron. Although Peeves did not usually heed commands, he did recognise authority of a sort. Though generally unimpressed by titles and badges, he is generally amenable to the strictures of the teachers, agreeing to stay out of their classrooms while they teach. He has also been known to show an affinity for rare students (notably [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]).

However, Peeves was loyal and devoted to Hogwarts and proved this twice: first by defying the hated Dolores Umbridge by assaulting her endlessly with trouble, and then in the Battle of Hogwarts where he dropped [[Snargaluff]] pods on Death Eaters in mid-air, causing general chaos among their ranks and later showing evident joy when Voldemort was defeated.

Peeves also possessed a honourable side, as after Jacob's sibling had caused great chaos around Hogwarts, Peeves kept his end of the bargain. Students were known to allow Peeves to take the blame for their own mischief, for which he accepted responsibility, as he never had any fear of repercussions.

==Relationships==
===Fred and George Weasley===
[[File:Fred george weasley.jpg|250px|thumb|The Weasley twins, who he appeared to respect]]
{{Quote|Give [[Dolores Umbridge|her]] hell from [[Fred and George Weasley|us]], Peeves!|Fred and George telling Peeves to wreck Umbridge's life at Hogwarts before departing|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Though he never hesitated to prank them, Peeves appeared to genuinely like [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]. Presumably, this was due to their shared trait of taking delight in causing trouble for authorities. Peeves shocked everyone in [[1996]] when he actually listened to the twins' words, causing countless problems for [[Dolores Umbridge]]. As the twins left Hogwarts, Peeves saluted them in front of the student body.

===Argus Filch===
[[File:Filch_and_mrs._Norris.png|220x220px|thumb|left|[[Argus Filch]], his enemy]]
{{Quote|Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven't you been complaining about him for the last quarter of a century?|Professor McGonagall sending Filch to find Peeves in order to assist in the defence of Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Peeves and [[Argus Filch]] were sworn enemies for over twenty-five years. Filch never ceased his futile efforts to get Peeves banished from the castle, and Peeves never stopped taunting Filch. To annoy Filch, Peeves trapped Mrs Norris in a suit of armour twice, dropped chandeliers and caused general mayhem, which Filch was later responsible for cleaning. It is presumed that this ongoing war between them continued after the Battle of Hogwarts, but Peeves' valour in service to the school during the fighting would have only made it harder for Filch to ever get him removed.

===The Bloody Baron===
{{Quote|The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us Prefects.|[[Percy Weasley]] to [[Neville Longbottom]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Bloody Baron.jpg|220x220px|thumb|The [[Bloody Baron]], whom he both respected and feared]]
Apart from the Weasley twins, the [[Bloody Baron]] was the only being that Peeves took orders from. For unknown reasons, the Baron was one of the only beings that Peeves dared not cross. During his first year, [[Harry Potter|Harry]] imitated the voice of the [[Bloody Baron]] to chase Peeves away so Harry could get around [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] without Peeves in the way. Peeves, fooled into thinking the Baron was speaking to him from the shadows, immediately left and promised to stay out of the area for the rest of the night as instructed.

===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Albus Dumbledore|We need to find her. Professor McGonagall, please go to Mr Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.|Peeves|You'll be lucky!|What do you mean, Peeves?|Ashamed, Your Headship, sir. Doesn't want to be seen. She's a horrible mess. Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the trees. Crying something dreadful. Poor thing.|Albus Dumbledore and Peeves, after the attack on the [[Fat Lady]].|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]], whom he held much respect for]]
Apart from the Bloody Baron and the Weasley twins, [[Albus Dumbledore]] was the only being in Hogwarts who Peeves was known to have shown any respect for. In Dumbledore's presence, Peeves adopted an oily voice in an attempt to be polite to the headmaster — which was likely out of fear that Dumbledore could have him expelled from the school if he angered him.

===Hogwarts students and staff===
[[File:Hogwarts staff (1991).JPG|250px|thumb|Hogwarts staff]]
Peeves enjoyed taunting all the students and staff members of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].

Peeves also happened to enjoy tormenting [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]]. He tried to get them in trouble with [[Neville Longbottom]] when he found them out of bed late in their first year, but was once beaten by them that same year (excluding Neville) when Harry impersonated the Bloody Baron, telling him to go away from the third floor so they could save the Philosopher's Stone without any interference (although he was unaware of this). The next year, Peeves made a foolish alarm that Harry had petrified two more people (Justin Finch-Fletchley and Nearly Headless Nick) and shouting that no humans or ghosts were safe.

Peeves had directly clashed with other past Hogwarts caretakers, including [[Hankerton Humble]] and [[Rancorous Carpe]]. An attempt by Carpe to remove Peeves by luring him into a [[Rancorous Carpe's trap|trap]] featuring weapons and trapping him with [[Containment Charm]]s instead resulted in Peeves seizing the weapons and then subjecting Hogwarts to a three-day standoff. The standoff was only ended when then Headmistress [[Eupraxia Mole]] drew up a [[Peeves's contract|contract]] that granted him special privileges, including a once-weekly swim in the boys' toilets on the ground floor, first refusal on stale bread from the [[Hogwarts kitchens|kitchen]] for throwing purposes, and a new hat — to be custom-made by [[Bonhabille|Madame Bonhabille]] of [[Paris]].

However, despite all this, Peeves's surprisingly high loyalty to Hogwarts proved to allow him to work with both students and teachers alike when Hogwarts is truly in great danger, as he valiantly fought for Hogwarts during the Battle of Hogwarts and effectively coordinated with the fighters on Hogwarts's side; he taunted and attacked only the Death Eaters, and never once pranked any of those fighting for Hogwarts.

==Etymology==
*''Peeve'' means ''little devil'' or something that is personally annoying; a personal dislike (like a [[Wikipedia:Pet peeve|pet peeve]]). Peevish means disagreeable and bad-tempered.

[[File:Peeves-lego.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Peeves as a LEGO minifigure]]
*According to [[J. K. Rowling]]'s website, Peeves was "an indestructible [[spirit]] of chaos".
*Peeves has appeared in all of the books and the first three video games, but none of the films. A scene with Peeves was filmed for {{PS|FA}}, but was left on the cutting room floor and to date has never even been released in any form, even the ''Ultimate Edition'' box set. Peeves' role in the films was replaced with his archenemy [[Argus Filch]] instead. Peeves was set to be played by the late British actor [[Rik Mayall]], who was ironically known for his title role in the film ''{{W|Drop Dead Fred}}'', in which he played a mischievous imaginary friend (somewhat similar to Peeves). According to {{HPLE}}, Peeves was conceived as having a consistently devilish grin, though there was a question of whether or not he would have hair. It is unknown why the character of Peeves was cut from the films. 
*The only on-screen reference to Peeves occurs in the short film {{QH}}, during which Harry Potter describes Peeves using the Queen's Birthday as an excuse to drop coloured eggs on Hogwarts students at breakfast, but then he appears during breakfast anyway.
*In the video games, Peeves is battled several times. For example, he randomly pops up out of boxes. In the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|PC version]] of {{PS}}, Peeves is defeated with the [[Knockback Jinx]]. In the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|PC game]] of {{COS}}, he is defeated with the [[Skurge Charm]]. In the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|PC version]] of {{POA}}, where he is defeated with the [[Tickling Charm]], as well as the [[Seize and pull charm]] and [[Freezing Spell]] in certain boss fights. Also, in the DS versions of {{LEGO|Y1}} and {{LEGO|Y2}}, he is somewhat of a boss.
*Although Peeves does not actually appear in {{OOTP|GA}}, some students make references to him, saying things like, "Want to go watch Peeves throw things?"
*Peeves was voiced by [[Chris Crosby]] in the video game adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' and the ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. He was voiced by [[Jeff Leach]] in {{MA}}.
*Although in the third book Peeves shows a bit of respect for Albus Dumbledore, it is noted in the fourth book that the Bloody Baron is the only one really able to control Peeves.
*Peeves is [[James and Oliver Phelps|Oliver Phelps]]'s favourite character in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|''Harry Potter'' series]].
