'''Thorfinn Rowle''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Dark Wizard]] and a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who fought in the [[Second Wizarding War]]. He fought at the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], where he accidentally [[Killing Curse|killed]] fellow Death Eater [[Gibbon]], burned [[Hagrid's Hut|Rubeus Hagrid's cabin]], and [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] [[Harry Potter]]. On [[1 August]], [[1997]], he tracked Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] to [[Tottenham Court Road]] along with [[Antonin Dolohov]] disguised as construction workers, but the two Death Eaters were defeated and their memories were [[Memory Charm|modified]] by Hermione to cover their escape. After this failure, Rowle was punished severely by Lord Voldemort. He also fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on [[2 May]], [[1998]].

Rowle's fate after the Second Wizarding War and Voldemort's final defeat is uncertain, although it is highly likely he was either killed or defeated during the Battle of Hogwarts, or that he was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] with a life sentence for his crimes.



Rowle was one of the [[Death Eaters]] of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] who fought in the [[Second Wizarding War]]. It is unknown if he had also fought in the [[First Wizarding War]], though the fact that [[Ronald Weasley]] recognised him as well as [[Antonin Dolohov]] from old wanted posters suggests that he was. It's unknown if he was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]], though if not it's most likely that he was one of the [[Death Eaters]] who did not search for Voldemort after his downfall.

Battle of the Astronomy Tower



Rowle participated in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower|attack]] on [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1997]]; he stayed below the [[Hogwarts Castle|Astronomy Tower]] in the main part of the Castle, and fought defenders by firing curses in all directions.

As battle recommenced, Rowle again fired [[curse]]s everywhere, and after being hit in the face by one of Harry Potter's [[hex]]es he began to retreat from the school. During his retreat he somehow managed to make it to the grounds before Harry. He attempted to [[curse]] [[Rubeus Hagrid]], but his curses [[Spell resistance|had no effect]] on Hagrid because of his [[Half-giant]] blood. Instead, Rowle [[Fire-making spell|set]] [[Hagrid's hut]] on [[fire]] forcing Hagrid to rescue his dog [[Fang]], who was inside. He was then ordered by [[Severus Snape]], who at the time was operating in his capacity as a double-agent in open support of Voldemort, to leave the grounds and [[Apparition|Disapparate]] away with [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]].

Luchino Caffe Duel



He was not identified by name to [[Harry Potter]] until they met face to face in the chaos following the attack on the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[1997]]. He and [[Antonin Dolohov]] tracked Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] to a [[Luchino Caffe|café]] on [[Tottenham Court Road]] via the [[Taboo|Taboo curse]] on Voldemort's name after their escape from [[the Burrow]]. A [[Luchino Caffe Duel|fight]] broke out, and Rowle was [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by Harry, who was under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]]. Afterward, his and Dolohov's memories were [[Memory Charm|modified]] by Hermione, even though she had not previously performed the enchantment. Ron recognised him and his partner, [[Antonin Dolohov]], from an old ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' wanted poster.

Through his connection to Voldemort, Harry witnessed Voldemort ordering [[Draco Malfoy]] to [[Cruciatus Curse|torture]] Rowle soon after this incident and threatened to feed him to [[Nagini]], as punishment for failing to capture Harry and his friends. His partner, Antonin Dolohov was also similarly punished. Despite this, both Rowle and Dolohov were spared though other [[Death Eaters]] were more careful about signalling Voldemort after that.

Battle of Hogwarts


Harry saw Rowle once again when he entered the [[Forbidden Forest]] to confront Voldemort; Rowle was in the Death Eater camp dabbing at his bleeding lip, which means that he fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] with his fellow Death Eaters. When Hagrid began to verbally protest Harry's seeming sacrifice, he [[Nonverbal spell|non-verbally]] silenced [[Rubeus Hagrid]] instantly with the [[Silencing Charm]]. It is unknown if he later survived the battle, as he may have been killed in the final stage of the battle. If he did survive, he was most likely captured and incarcerated in [[Azkaban]] for his crimes.



Thorfinn Rowle was an enormous, muscled Death Eater with blond hair. As a Death Eater, he bore the [[Dark Mark]] on his left inner forearm, which faded to a mere scar upon Voldemort's death.



Rowle was very cruel and extremely reckless, as he cast several [[Killing Curse]]s indiscriminately during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], He didn't hesitate to [[Fire-making spell|burn]] down [[Hagrid's Hut|Rubeus Hagrid's cabin]] while [[Fang]] was still inside, whether to distract Hagrid or simply out of sheer cruelty. He also seemed to be highly disrespectful and impatient as shown when he waved away the [[Waitress at Luchino Caffe|waitress]] when she arrived to take his and Dolohov's order, though this may be more due to the fact that she was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] and that they were undercover. He apparently had little regard for his comrades as he did not seem to care about accidentally killing Gibbon, though he may have gotten along with other Death Eaters such as [[Antonin Dolohov]]. He showed no reluctance or resentment towards [[Severus Snape]] when ordered to flee rather to continue [[Cruciatus Curse|torturing]] [[Harry Potter]], showing a willingness to take orders from higher ranking comrades. As a Death Eater and a member of the pure-blooded [[Rowle family]], he likely held Muggles, Muggle borns, and blood traitors with intense scorn and hatred. According to [[Nymphadora Tonks]], Rowle appeared to be prepared to fight to the death during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, resulting in aggressiveness that overwhelmed the [[Order of the Phoenix]].


]]
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Rowle was a highly proficient and aggressive duellist, as he was able to hold his own against [[Nymphadora Tonks]] during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] while simultaneously throwing curses around until [[Harry Potter]] hit him in the face with a hex. He also nearly killed the notably skilled [[Remus Lupin]] during the same battle. He seemed to generally cause the most damage during the battle and held several [[Order of the Phoenix]] and [[Dumbledore's Army]] members at bay while his fellows cornered a weakened Albus Dumbledore and managed to survive the battle mostly unscathed. He also fought against [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]], but was quickly defeated by Harry, who was under his Invisibility Cloak. He later fought with his fellow Death Eaters in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], though his actions during the battle are mostly unknown.
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Rowle was able to cast the [[Unforgivable Curses]] (which require ability and genuine malice to perform); he used the [[Killing Curse]] during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower in 1997. He also fired a destructive [[curse]] that was strong enough to cause heavy damage to the Hogwarts roof, and destroy the [[cursed barrier]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Rowle set [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] hut on [[fire]] during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] by use of the [[Fire-Making Spell]]. The spell was powerful, as it was enough to set the whole hut ablaze and caused an "explosive bang". He was also able to cast the [[Silencing Charm]] in [[1998]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on Hagrid with success despite the latter being a half-giant.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Rowle was able to cast the [[Silencing Charm]] on Hagrid without speaking the [[incantation]] during the Battle of Hogwarts, and was able to fire multiple non-verbal spells at Tonks during their duel in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and later at Hagrid during his escape.
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Being an accomplished adult wizard, Rowle was capable of Apparition. Rowle was able to disapparate from beyond Hogwarts grounds following the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]].


''Thorfinn'' is a Norse name, and may refer to Thorfinn the Mighty, an eleventh-century earl of Orkney. In the ''Orkneyinga Saga'', he is described as "unusually tall and strong...a forceful man, greedy for fame and fortune. He did well in battle, for he was both a good tactician and full of courage." It may also link with Thor, the Viking god of thunder, and a mighty warrior of massive physical stature.



*Thorfinn Rowle is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[Rod Hunt]] in  and in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|film adaptations]] of .
*In the book  he is never named, being only referred to as "The Big Blond Death Eater" or some variation. He is not properly named until the next book, ​​, when [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] recognises him from old wanted posters.
*In , Rowle is present for [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s death at the hands of [[Severus Snape]]. This differs from the novel where he remained behind to fight the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's army members in order to prevent them from interfering.
*Also in , Rowle's role in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] is handed over to [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], during which she burns down [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s hut instead of Rowle, as he does in the book.
*In the book of , Rowle is the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] to shout at [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], however, in , an [[Unidentified male Death Eater during the Battle of Hogwarts|unidentified male Death Eater]] does, possibly because Rowle's character is not as big as in the books—which is strange, considering Rowle has been in the films before and this character randomly showed up for this scene.
*Since he was featured on old wanted posters, it's likely that he was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] following Voldemort's first defeat. If so this is ironic as his possible ancestor [[Damocles Rowle]] was the one to establish Azkaban as a prison.
