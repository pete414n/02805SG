}}'''S. Fawcett''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Ravenclaw]]<ref name="gof16">{{GOF|B|16}}</ref> student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1990s]]. She lived with her [[Fawcett family|family]] near [[Ottery St Catchpole]].<ref name="gof6">{{GOF|B|6}}</ref>

==Biography==
===[[1992–1993 school year]]===
In [[1992]], she attended the [[Duelling Club]] set up by [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] and received a minor injury. She was probably paired up with another student and started [[duelling]] like everyone else.<ref name="COS11">{{COS|B|11}}</ref>

===[[1994–1995 school year]]===
In [[1994]], she did not attend the [[Quidditch World Cup]], because her family couldn't get tickets.<ref name="gof6" /> On [[Hallowe'en]], she attempted to place her name in the [[Goblet of Fire]] to participate in the [[Triwizard Tournament]] by using an [[Ageing Potion]]. Because of [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Age Line]], however, she grew a long white beard instead.<ref name="gof16" /> Later, on Christmas Eve, Fawcett attended the [[Yule Ball]] with [[Stebbins (Potter-era)|Stebbins]], and both were docked ten [[House points|points]] by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] when he caught them together in the rose garden.<ref name="gof23">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref> This suggests that she was a [[fourth year]] or above, as she was able to attend the Yule Ball, unless she was invited by Stebbins (just like [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] was invited by [[Neville Longbottom]] as she didn't have the proper age to attend the Yule Ball at that time); but given that Fawcett and Stebbins were caught together in the rose garden, they might have met each other for a time; they might have been the same age and started attending Hogwarts the same year.

Sometime during her time at the school, she borrowed the [[Hogwarts Library|library]] copy of {{QTA}}, and was due to return it on [[16 September]].<ref name="QTAR">{{QTA|R}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Fawcett was portrayed by [[Alex Argenti]] in {{GOF|FA}}, but her scenes were cut from the theatrical version, but appeared in a deleted scene on the DVD of the film. In the scene, she and [[Stebbins (Potter-era)|Stebbins]] are not caught by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] in the rose bushes, but in a [[Hogwarts Carriages|Hogwarts carriage]] parked in the [[Viaduct Courtyard|Entrance Courtyard]].
**However, in some television showings, this scene is in the actual film.
*In the [[Great Britain|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Russia]]n, [[Poland|Polish]], and [[Denmark|Danish]] editions of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', when Snape catches Fawcett with Stebbins in chapter 23, he says, "Ten points from [[Hufflepuff]], Fawcett! And ten points from [[Ravenclaw]], too, Stebbins!", although Fawcett is referred to as a Ravenclaw by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in chapter 16.<ref name="lexicon">"[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/fawcett-family/miss-s-fawcett/ S. Fawcett]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> The American edition of the novel amends this error, with Snape taking Fawcett's points from Ravenclaw, and Stebbins' from Hufflepuff.<ref name="lexicon" /> In the ''Goblet of Fire'' film, however, Snape makes a similar error where he refers to Fawcett as a Hufflepuff and Stebbins as a Ravenclaw. The only way it couldn't be a mistake is that Snape mentions the consequences of the partner's rule-breakings.
