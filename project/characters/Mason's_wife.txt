{{Quote|Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs Mason...|[[Petunia Dursley]] practising compliments for Mrs Mason|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
'''Mrs Mason''' was the {{w|Ornithophobia|ornithophobic}} wife of [[Mason|Mr Mason]],

==Biography==
On [[31 July]], [[1992]], the couple were dinner guests at the [[4 Privet Drive|Dursley home]]. Their evening was nearly ruined when the dessert [[Petunia Dursley]] had made crashed to the floor (an incident blamed on [[Harry Potter]] though it was [[Dobby]]'s fault), which they were extremely shocked at. The evening could have been rescued were it not for the barn [[owl]], that flew through the open window to deliver a letter of warning of a breach of the [[Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]] for Harry. The owl dropped the letter on Mrs Mason's head, and due to her extreme fear of [[bird]]s, she “screamed like a [[banshee]]” and ran from the house shouting something about lunatics, followed quickly by her husband.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Mrs Mason.jpg|thumb|Mrs Mason after Dobby dropped the pudding on her head, in the film adaptation|250x250px]]
*Mrs Mason was portrayed by [[Veronica Clifford]] in {{COS|FA}}.
*In {{COS|FA}}, the dessert, levitated by [[Dobby]], crashed down on Mrs Mason's head, ruining the dinner party and causing [[Vernon Dursley]] to lock Harry in his bedroom.
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] eats the smashed [[pudding]] off Mrs Mason's head.
*In a deleted scene, when [[Petunia Dursley]] says to Mrs Mason that she had a nice dress, and she responds that all her dresses were tailor-made. This was her only line in the film, but was cut from the theatre version.
