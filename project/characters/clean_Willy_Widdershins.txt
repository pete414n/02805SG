'''Willy Widdershins''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who repeatedly engaged in [[Muggle-baiting]] pranks. He was later caught selling [[biting doorknob]]s and was subsequently given a prison sentence that he could not avoid.



In adulthood, he repeatedly engaged in [[Muggle-baiting]] pranks.

  
In [[1995]], he was arrested by the British Ministry of Magic for [[jinx]]ing a series of [[Regurgitating Toilet|regurgitating toilets]] in [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] areas such as [[Bethnal Green]], one of which backfired against him during its creation, as well as covering him in the toilet's contents. He was badly injured in his capture and was wrapped heavily in bandages. To avoid prosecution, he made a deal with the Ministry, that if he spied on [[Harry Potter]] and his friends, they would let him go. He did so, and reported to [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]] [[Dolores Umbridge]] and [[Cornelius Fudge]] that they were planning on making a [[Dumbledore's Army|secret Defence Against the Dark Arts group]] while they were in a meeting at the [[Hog's Head Inn]]. The fact that the Ministry was willing to work with a petty criminal who had violated wizarding law highlighted how corrupt and immoral they were at the time.

Despite being given a second chance, Widdershins soon resumed his criminal activity and was later caught selling [[biting doorknob]]s, which bit off the fingers of two Muggles, and was subsequently given a prison sentence.


Widdershins was an extremely mischievous wizarding prankster who enjoyed using [[magic]] to play pranks on unsuspecting [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], which was a violation of [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|wizarding law]], showing he appeared to have little regard for the law and saw no problem in breaking it. He also appeared rather underhand in nature, given how he willingly spied on [[Harry Potter]] and his friends in the Hog's Head for the Ministry. [[Arthur Weasley]] once commented that he was "a wily one".

His feeling towards Muggles was unknown; he could have felt his pranks on them were harmless jokes, but according to Arthur Weasley, [[Muggle-baiting]] pranks were often a sign of sinister [[Wizarding supremacy|supremacist]] attitudes towards Muggles. He also seemed to be unrepentant and stubborn, as even after one of his pranks backfired, resulting in him being injured and arrested, he continued to create such harmful prank despite the "second chance" he received from his deal with the Ministry.


*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Widdershins was proficient with using amusing [[jinx]]es to [[Charm|enchant]] Muggle toilets, making them [[Regurgitating Toilet|regurgitate]], although one of his jinxes backfired, badly injuring him.


''Widdershins'' (sometimes ''withershins'', ''widershins'' or ''widderschynnes'') means to take a course opposite the apparent motion of the sun (in the Northern hemisphere), going anti-clockwise, lefthandwise, or to circle an object, by always keeping it on the left.


*It is possible that Willy may be the same [[Will]] mentioned by [[Mundungus Fletcher]] earlier in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|same book]].
