'''Dirk Cresswell''' (c. [[1961]] â€“ [[March]], [[1998]]) was a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. In the mid-[[1990s]] he became Head of the [[Goblin Liaison Office]], in the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

Dirk attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1970s]], becoming a favourite student of [[Potions Master]] [[Horace Slughorn]]. One of Dirk's most notable traits was his fluency in [[Gobbledegook]]. After graduating, he went to work at the Ministry and eventually became Head of the Goblin Liaison Office. Many of his colleagues considered him a great wizard. 

When the Ministry was taken over by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], Dirk attempted to use a forged family tree in order to claim wizarding heritage, but was discovered by [[Albert Runcorn]]. He went on the run to avoid the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]], but was eventually caught and murdered by [[Snatchers]].




Dirk Cresswell was born sometime between September, 1960 and September, 1961, presumably somewhere in the British Isles, into the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Cresswell family]]. Having displayed [[magic]]al ability, he was eventually offered a place at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he undertook his magical education from on around [[1972]] to likely [[1978]]. According to [[Professor]] [[Horace Slughorn]], the [[Potions Master]] of the day, Cresswell was an exceptional student, and he was invited to join the [[Slug Club]].



Sometime after graduating from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1979, Cresswell joined the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. He eventually rose to the post of Head of the [[Goblin Liaison Office]], succeeding [[Cuthbert Mockridge]] in either 1994, 1995, or 1996.

He remained in contact with [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] and passed on news about internal affairs at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] to him, something of which Slughorn was glad of. [[Albus Dumbledore]] also suggested that Slughorn's friendliness with Cresswell resulted in Cresswell requesting him to make suggestions for possible junior members within the Goblin Liaison Office.

Muggle-Born Registration Commission


During the height of the Second Wizarding War, on 1 August, 1997, the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was taken over by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Shortly after, it began persecuting [[Muggle-born]] wizards and witches, beginning with the formation of the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] and the Snatchers organisations, in accordance with the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] ideology. Muggle-borns were accused of having stolen [[magic]] and sentenced to [[Azkaban]] for it.

Cresswell arranged with a wizard to forge a false family tree so that the Ministry would believe that he was of a different [[blood status]]. However, [[Albert Runcorn]], a powerful Ministry official and supporter of the Death Eater regime, tracked the wizard who faked his family tree and Cresswell was arrested.

Auror John Dawlish was charged with transporting Cresswell to Azkaban fortress in the North Sea, via [[broomstick]]. Halfway to the prison, Dirk managed to [[Stunning Spell|stun]] Dawlish, whom he believed to be under the effects of the [[Confundus Charm]], and stole the [[Auror]]'s [[John Dawlish's broomstick|broomstick]], using it to escape.


 



Dirk then went on the run, eventually meeting up with fellow fugitives [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]] and [[Dean Thomas]], as well as goblins [[Griphook]] and [[Gornuk]]. The group proceeded to stay on the move along the countryside.

One night, in the autumn of 1997, they set camp on a riverbank in [[Wales]], where they could summon some salmon to eat. Unbeknownst to any of them, [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] were sitting in a tent concealed from sight by a number of protective enchantments. The group started talking. Dirk told them of his escape. The subject of conversation turned into war and [[Harry Potter]]. Dirk told the group he had doubts [[Severus Snape]] had really killed [[Albus Dumbledore]], as the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', which he had been reading, made such a strong case against Harry. Tonks told Cresswell to start reading ''[[The Quibbler]]'', an independent publication not under the control of the Ministry, to know the facts. Cresswell exploded into laughter, swallowing a fish bone and expressing scorn at what he called "''that lunatic rag of [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]]'s''". They told Cresswell ''The Quibbler'' was not so lunatic any more, and Dean voiced his trust in Harry.

The conversation soon enough turned into a discussion of whether they should sleep there or back up a wooded slope whence they came. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire and clambered back up the incline.

Death

Eventually, the group was caught by a gang of Snatchers and Cresswell, Ted Tonks, and Gornuk were murdered while resisting capture. Griphook and Dean Thomas managed to escape relatively unscathed.


The death of Dirk Cresswell and his comrades was omitted from the ''Daily Prophet'' and the ''[[Wizarding Wireless Network News]]'', which were under the control of the Death Eater regime and ceased reporting deaths caused by Voldemort's regime. It was, however, announced in a [[March]], [[1998]], broadcast of ''[[Potterwatch]]''. Dirk left behind a [[Dirk Cresswell's wife|wife]] and at least [[Cresswell brothers|two sons]].


Many considered Dirk a great [[Wizardkind|wizard]] (such as [[Arthur Weasley]] and [[Horace Slughorn]]), which suggests that he was very gifted in [[magic]].
*'''[[Potion]]s''': The [[Potions Master]] [[Horace Slughorn]] considered Dirk to be one of his "all-time favourite students" whilst he was a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], implying he was proficient in [[Potions (class)|Potions]].
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Dirk was a competent [[broomstick]] flyer, as he was successfully able to use [[John Dawlish]]'s [[John Dawlish's broomstick|broomstick]] to escape from capture via flight.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Dirk was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], an incredibly advanced and impressive piece of [[magic]] and evidence of superior magical skill. He was able to successfully subdue [[John Dawlish]] with the [[Stunning Spell]], allowing him to escape capture.
*'''Multilingualism''': Dirk was fluent in [[Gobbledegook]], the language of [[Goblin]]s, a notable talent which allowed him to become head of the [[Goblin Liaison Office]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. He was able to instantly understand [[Griphook]]s use of the language whilst in hiding with him.


The name "Dirk" is the short form of ''Diederik''. The name was popularised in the English-speaking world by actor Dirk Bogarde (1921-1999), who had some Dutch ancestry. This is also the Scots word for a type of dagger.



*Dirk Cresswell is played in  by an unknown actor. The part is listed by IMDb as being played (uncredited) by [[Ricky Wilson]], lead singer of the [[wikipedia:Kaiser Chiefs|Kaiser Chiefs]]. The role was never identified in the film, but the character of Dirk Cresswell took on his appearance in . Wilson himself however has said it was in fact not him playing Cresswell. Ricky was offered a part as a singer in a wedding band, but the band was eventually replaced by CGI instruments. Ricky however still asked if he could be in the film, and was an extra (leaning against a wall in a purple suit), for which he had to do five days' shooting.
*Like [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]] and [[Gornuk]], Dirk Cresswell's outlaw storyline was cut from , although all three are briefly mentioned on the radio to have been killed.
