{{Quote|And now, over to Jim McGuffin for the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls, tonight, Jim?''"<br />"''Well, Ted, I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as [[Kent]], [[Yorkshire]], and [[Dundee]] have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating [[Bonfire Night]] early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.|Ted and Jim McGuffin|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
'''Jim McGuffin''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[television]] weatherman in [[1981]], working alongside [[Ted]]. McGuffin had predicted [[Water|rain]] for [[1 November|November 1st]], but due to the downfall of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and celebrations by the [[Wizarding world|Wizarding community]], his forecasted rain became shooting stars across some areas of [[Great Britain]]. Obviously unaware of the true reason, McGuffin wondered on air if people had been [[Fall of Lord Voldemort celebrations|celebrating]] [[Bonfire Night]] early. [[Vernon Dursley]] watched the broadcast, prompting him to ask his wife, [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]], if the peculiar weather had anything to do with her [[Lily J. Potter|sister's]] "[[Wizardkind|people]]."

==Behind the scenes==
*In fiction, a '''MacGuffin''' (sometimes '''McGuffin''' or '''maguffin''') is a plot device in the form of some goal, desired object, or other motivator that the protagonist pursues, often with little or no narrative explanation. The specific nature of a MacGuffin is typically unimportant to the overall plot. The most common type of MacGuffin is a person, place, or thing (such as money or an object of value). Other more abstract types include victory, glory, survival, power, love, or some unexplained driving force.
