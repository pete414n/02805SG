'''Eddie Carmichael''' (born c. [[1978]]-[[1979]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1990]].


He was a member of [[Ravenclaw]] house and claimed that he achieved nine "[[Outstanding]]s" in his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L]] exams. Eddie swore his success was solely as a result of [[Baruffio's Brain Elixir]] and [[Hogwarts black-market trade|attempted to sell it to younger students preparing for their exams]], including [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley]]. However, [[Hermione Granger]] stopped him, confiscated the [[potion]] and poured its contents down a toilet.
