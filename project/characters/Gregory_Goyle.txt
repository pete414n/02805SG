'''Gregory Goyle''' (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. Goyle was the son of [[Gregory Goyle's father|a Death Eater]] and [[Gregory Goyle's mother|his wife]]. It is unknown if he was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] as well.

Goyle, along with fellow Slytherin [[Vincent Crabbe]], seemed to already be best friends with [[Draco Malfoy]] before their first year at Hogwarts. Both wizards were shown to be more lackeys than friends, often following Malfoy around and doing his bidding.

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1980-1991}}===
Gregory Goyle was born into a [[pure-blood]] magical family in late 1979 or early 1980. His father, [[Gregory Goyle's father|Mr Goyle]], was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] during the [[First Wizarding War]] and a loyal supporter of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] until his downfall in 1981. Several Death Eaters avoided imprisonment in [[Azkaban]] by claiming that the Dark Lord had controlled them with the [[Imperius Curse]]. It is likely that Mr Goyle did this as well.

Due to all of their fathers being Death Eaters, Goyle probably knew [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Vincent Crabbe]] before his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Like many new students, he might have purchased his wand from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]].

===Hogwarts years {{C|1991-1998}}===
====First year====
{{Quote|They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he passed, too.|Harry Potter regarding Goyle's stupidity and [[first year exams]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}Goyle started his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. He, Draco, and Crabbe met [[Harry Potter]] and offered him acceptance into their clan. Harry rejected this offer and left Draco Malfoy, the leader of the group, confused as to why he would choose to be friends with [[Ronald Weasley]] instead. After being rejected, Goyle attempted to steal some of Harry and Ron's treats from the food trolley and he ended up getting bitten by Ron's pet rat, [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]].<ref name="PS">{{PS}}</ref>

[[File:The Trio (Crabbe, Malfoy and Goyle) 1991b.JPG|250px|thumb|left|[[Vincent Crabbe]], [[Draco Malfoy]], and Gregory Goyle in their first Potions class]]

When he arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], he was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into the House of [[Slytherin]] with his friends Draco Malfoy and Vincent Crabbe. Throughout the year, Goyle was mean to Harry Potter and Ron Weasley and at the end of the year final exam results were to be given out and Harry Potter (who disliked Goyle) hoped that he was as stupid as he was mean and would fail his exams. However, Goyle just managed to scrape through them and thus passed his first year of education.<ref name="PS"/>

====Second year====
{{Quote|Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry. Oh, you know what I mean — Goyle's Potion looked like bogies.|[[Hermione Granger]] speaking about Goyle's polyjuice potion|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:VincentCrabbe WB F2 SlytherinCommonRoom Promo.jpg|250px|thumb|Crabbe and Goyle in the Slytherin Common Room]]
In his [[second year]] of education, the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was opened for the second time, having opened 50 years previously when [[Tom Riddle]] was in education. There was suspicion amongst the students as to who the Chamber was referring to when messages regarding an 'Heir of Slytherin' were written on walls in blood. Some speculated that it was [[Harry Potter]], others [[Draco Malfoy]].<ref name="COS">{{COS}}</ref>

[[File:Crabbe & Goyle Drugged.gif|250px|thumb|left|Crabbe and Goyle eating the cakes containing [[Sleeping Draught]]]]
Harry, Ron, and Hermione wanted to get more information and decided to brew [[Polyjuice Potion]] so that they could take the forms of Goyle, Crabbe, and [[Millicent Bulstrode]] and question Draco. When attempting to steal items from [[Severus Snape]]'s store room for the Polyjuice Potion, Hermione Granger needed a distraction and Harry threw a firecracker into Goyle's [[Swelling Solution]].<ref name="COS"/>

Over the [[Christmas holidays]], the Polyjuice potion was finally completed and the three needed to get some of their designated pupils' DNA in order to make a transformation. Hermione had already gotten hairs from Millicent Bulstrode's robes during a violent [[Duelling Club]] practise; however she did not know that these hairs actually belonged to her cat. Harry and Ron still needed to get some hairs of Crabbe and Goyle and put Sleeping Draught into some [[Chocolate cake|cakes]] that Goyle and Crabbe would later eat and fall asleep. Once they fell asleep Ron and Harry managed to acquire their hair, Goyle's hair turned the Polyjuice potion a khaki colour when it was added.<ref name="COS"/>

====Third year====
{{Quote|An unworthy trick! A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!|[[Minerva McGonagall]] condemning Goyle and his friends' behaviour at a Quidditch match|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Shrieking shack third year.png|250px|thumb|Harry Potter humiliating Draco Malfoy, Goyle, and Crabbe at the Shrieking Shack|alt=]]

On the way to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] for his third year of education, Goyle, along with his friends, stepped into [[Harry Potter]]'s compartment to bully him. However, they could not act on their wishes as new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor [[Remus Lupin]] was in the compartment sleeping and they left. Early in the school year it was quite clear that the [[Dementor]]s guarding Hogwarts from [[Sirius Black]] were feared by Harry and during a [[Quidditch]] match, Goyle and his friends put their cloaks up and pretended to be [[Dementor]]s in an attempt to scare Harry, which it did; Harry cast a corporal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] charm in attempt to ward off the 'Dementors' before realising that it was a prank. Goyle and his friends were caught by an angry McGonagall, who gave them all detention.<ref name="POA">{{POA}}</ref>

Goyle was later humiliated when Harry (under his invisibility cloak) defended his friends [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] by throwing snowballs at him and pulling down his trousers. Goyle's attempts to scare Harry later in the year were foiled as he had too much protection from students and staff.<ref name="POA"/>

====Fourth year====
{{Quote|Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on [[poison]]ous fungi.|Goyle after having been jinxed by Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Densaugeo and Furnunculus.png|250px|thumb|left|The result of Draco and Harry's duel outside of Potions class, after having taunted Harry]]
During the [[1994–1995 school year]], the [[Triwizard Tournament]] was held at Hogwarts. After [[Harry Potter]] became a champion alongside [[Cedric Diggory]], Goyle, Crabbe, and Malfoy passed out [[Potter Stinks badge|badges]] that could be made to read <nowiki>'</nowiki>''Potter Stinks''<nowiki>'</nowiki> and taunting Harry regularly, such as commenting that he was betting Harry wouldn't last more than a few minutes with the dragons. When provoked, Harry and Malfoy duelled, and Harry's [[Pimple Jinx]] meant for Malfoy rebounded and struck Goyle in the face. [[Severus Snape]] sent Goyle to the [[Hospital Wing]], but ignored the collateral damage to [[Hermione Granger]] from Malfoy's rebounding hex, [[Densaugeo]].<ref name="GOF"/>

At the end of the year, Harry was almost murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and saw that [[Gregory Goyle's father|Goyle's father]] was a Death Eater.<ref name="GOF">{{GOF}}</ref>

====Fifth year====

[[File:Inquisitorial Squad.jpg|thumb|Goyle being inducted into the Inquistorial Squad by [[Dolores Umbridge]]|alt=|241x241px]]

In his fifth year, Goyle became [[Beater]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]. This supported Angelina Johnson's belief that the team went for brawn rather than brains.<ref name="OOTP">{{OOTP}}</ref>

Goyle, along with both Crabbe and Malfoy, joined the shortly lived [[Inquisitorial Squad]] in [[1996]], for which the [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]] [[Dolores Umbridge]] had created in order to enforce obedience and authority throughout the student body. However, members the organisation abused their power to harass and bully non-Slytherin students, often deducting house points for petty reasons, behaviour which Goyle himself engaged in.<ref name="OOTP"/>

After Harry caused the arrest of Crabbe and Malfoy's fathers, Goyle followed his vengeful friends on an attempt to ambush him on the Hogwarts Express, but were [[hex]]ed so thoroughly by members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] that they were made to resemble large [[slug]]s. A similar event occurred at the end of the previous year, when Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George all used different hexes on them on the train.<ref name="OOTP"/>

====Sixth year====
{{Quote|If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres —|[[Severus Snape]]'s disappointment in Crabbe and Goyle|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince}}
During the [[1996–1997 school year]], Malfoy had Goyle and Crabbe turn into girls via [[Polyjuice Potion]] to be able to guard the [[Room of Requirement]] while Malfoy was repairing the [[Vanishing Cabinet]] inside. Goyle was transformed into a [[Unidentified little girl|little girl]] who held a pair of scales, which he was to drop noisily any time someone went past. During one of his watches, Harry frightened off Goyle, and waited unsuccessfully for Malfoy to exit. Goyle and Crabbe failed their [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] and had to redo their fifth year, in which they could not produce much positive works, thus causing Professor Snape to put them into detention.<ref name="HBP">{{HBP}}</ref>

At the end of the school year, Goyle and Crabbe were left looking lonely after Malfoy left the school just before the end of the term.<ref name="HBP"/>

====Seventh year and Battle of Hogwarts====
{{Quote|We was hiding in the corridor outside, we can do [[Disillusionment Charm|Diss-lusion Charms]] now! And then, you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum! What's a die-dum?|Goyle during the [[Skirmish at the Room of Requirement]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
<!-- DO NOT put that Goyle died in the Battle of Hogwarts. That event as depicted in the film contradicts the novel, in which it's Crabbe the one who dies and Goyle the one who survives along Draco. This didn't came to happen in the films because Jamie Wylett was doing community service -->

In their seventh year, Goyle and Crabbe were among the favoured students of the new [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] professors [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]]. For the first time, Goyle was able to excel at some of his school-work, as [[Neville Longbottom]] noted that he and Crabbe were proficient in the [[Dark Arts (class)|Dark Arts]] class taught by [[Amycus Carrow]],  which involved the torturing of disobedient [[first year]]s with the [[Cruciatus Curse]].<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

[[File:Malfoygoyle.jpg|249x249px|thumb|Malfoy and Goyle in the [[Room of Requirement]] during the Battle of Hogwarts|alt=|left]]

During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Goyle, Crabbe, and Malfoy did not flee with the other [[Slytherin]]s; instead, they tried to ambush [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] in the Room of Requirement. In the ensuing fight, Goyle was less aggressive than Crabbe, who defied Draco's orders and tried multiple dark curses. Goyle was [[Disarming Charm|disarmed]] by Harry and then [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by Hermione. When Crabbe's [[Fiendfyre|cursed fire]] got out of control, Goyle was saved by Ron and Hermione, who flew him out on their broom while Harry saved Draco. Crabbe was engulfed by the flames and killed. Harry and his friends then left Draco and Goyle to mourn Crabbe.<ref name="DH"/>

===Later life {{C|post 1998}}===
Very little is known of what happened to Goyle after the Second Wizarding War or his later life, or if he even survived the Battle of Hogwarts and thus the Second Wizarding War. If he did survive, his friendship with Draco apparently ended sometime after they completed school. It is even possible that he was arrested, tried and sent to [[Azkaban]] for using the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on other students at Hogwarts, along with all other [[Death Eaters]] and their allies. 

In [[2020]], while talking with Harry at the [[Ministry of Magic]], Draco revealed that he was always jealous about Harry having Ron and Hermione as friends while he had Goyle and Crabbe.<ref name="CC">{{CC}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|Goyle's mum'll be really pleased, he's loads better looking now.|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] after Goyle was heavily [[jinx]]ed and [[hex]]ed|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:905poagoyle.jpg|200px|thumb|Gregory in his third year]]
Goyle was described as having large feet, small dull eyes, long gorilla arms,<ref name="GOF"/> short, bristly hair low on his forehead, and broad shoulders. He and Crabbe were described as <nowiki>'</nowiki>''silent, hulking bodyguards''<nowiki>'</nowiki>.<ref name="PS"/> He also had a scar on one of his knuckles after being bitten by [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]].<ref name="POA"/>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|How thick can you get?|Ron Weasley commenting on the stupidity of Crabbe and Goyle|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
Goyle was generally less intelligent than Crabbe, always causing trouble and nearly failing his exams in his [[1991-1992 school year|first year]].<ref name="PS"/> He was unable to give [[Dolores Umbridge]] a simple answer after being questioned about [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s lessons, only being able to grin foolishly.<ref name="OOTP"/> In his [[1995-1996 school year|fifth year]] Goyle (along with Crabbe) failed his [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L]]., showing his weak academic ability and overall laziness.<ref name="HBP"/>

{{Quote|I'll make Goyle do lines, it'll kill him, he hates writing. I... must... not... look... like... a... [[baboon]]'s... backside....|Ron Weasley mocking Goyle's stupidity to his friends|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Goyle seemed to lack intelligence, [[magic]]al talent, and independent thought, thus used only his size and strength to bully other students or scare off anyone who threatened Malfoy. Goyle was also very sadistic and had no qualms about using the [[Cruciatus Curse]] to torture fellow students.<ref name="DH"/> However, while he did poorly in Defence Against the Dark Arts,<ref name="HBP"/> he excelled in the actual [[Dark Arts (class)|Dark Arts]] class, being top of the class due to his sadistic tendency to use fellow students as practise subjects for curses.<ref name="DH"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|First time they've ever been top in anything, I expect.|[[Neville Longbottom]] on Goyle's and Vincent Crabbe's affinity for the Cruciatus Curse|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Goyle proved to be a capable duellist when he and [[Crabbe]] had to fend off against [[Harry Potter|Harry]] on his way to the [[Astronomy Tower]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref> In the [[Skirmish at the Room of Requirement]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], he duelled with Harry, Ron and Hermione and fired multiple dark [[curse]]s at them, meaning he had some skill in [[martial magic]], but he was not skilled enough as he was [[Disarming Charm|disarmed]] by Hermione.<ref name="DH"/>
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Goyle was able to perform the [[Unforgivable Curses]] and was particularly skilled in the casting of the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. [[Neville Longbottom]] noted that because of his proficiency with the curse, it was probably the first time he had been top in anything.<ref name="DH"/> 
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Goyle was one of the [[Beater]]s for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], alongside his friend Crabbe. Like Crabbe, he was chosen for his size and strength rather than skill.<ref name="OOTP"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Goyle had some skills in charm-work, as he was able to cast the [[Disillusionment Charm]] on himself to hide himself from Harry, Ron and Hermione before they entered the [[Room of Requirement]] during the Battle of Hogwarts, along with Crabbe and Malfoy.<ref name="DH"/>

==Relationships==
===Draco Malfoy===
[[File:Draco Malfoy Promo HPB.jpg|thumb|[[Draco Malfoy]]]]

Goyle often followed Malfoy around.<ref name="PS"/> Simply put, he was nothing more than his lackey. However, Draco showed concern for him sometimes; he immediately reported Goyle's injury to Snape in their fourth year.<ref name="GOF"/> When Crabbe's [[Fiendfyre]] destroyed the Room of Requirement, Draco went out of his way to save Goyle from the flames, dragging him to safety.<ref name="DH"/>

After the second war, Draco had since severed ties with Goyle, due to his (and Crabbe's) lack of intelligence, making Goyle more of a thuggish lackey than a friend Draco could connect with, along with the excessive cruelty and recklessness he exhibited during the [[skirmish at the Room of Requirement]] that nearly killed everyone in the room.

===Vincent Crabbe===
[[File:904poagoyle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vincent Crabbe]], his friend]]

Vincent Crabbe was another of Malfoy's lackeys, and as such Crabbe and Goyle were best friends, wandering around and doing just about everything together.<ref name="PS"/> However, Crabbe was more intelligent and favoured by Malfoy because of this.

===Blaise Zabini===
Despite both being in Slytherin, Goyle and Blaise were not very close. When Blaise was knocked onto Goyle's lap, they snarled at each other and Goyle brutally flung Blaise off himself.<ref name="HBP"/>

===The trio===
[[File:Trio ootp 2007 2.jpg|251x251px|thumb|The trio (left to right): [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Harry Potter]], and [[Hermione Granger]], his enemies]]

Harry, Ron, and Hermione disliked Goyle greatly. He was also one of their four most disliked people at Hogwarts, even going as far as expressing their hope that Goyle might fail his exams in his first year and be forced to leave the school.<ref name="PS"/> However, Ron and Hermione did assist Draco in saving Goyle's life during the Battle of Hogwarts.<ref name="DH"/>

==Etymology==
*The name {{w|Gregory}} is derived from Greek meaning 'watchful, alert'. It is also associated with the {{w|Grigori}}, 'the Watchers', a group of fallen angels who mated with mortal women to spawn a race of giants. This may allude to Goyle frequently acting like a bodyguard to Draco Malfoy and to his large frame.
*His last name is probably from 'gargoyle', small monsters used to decorate buildings. The Gargouille also was a legendary water monster living in the River Seine in Paris, France. Gargoyles served as gutters/downspouts on gothic buildings. The word Gargoyle is derived from the French gargouille and the Latin ''gargula'' which translate to ''throat'' in contemporary English. Related words include gargle and gurgle.
*Interestingly, gargoyles' supposed jobs are to watch over the building they are perched on. They are portrayed as grim and monstrous characters.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:GoyleLEGOminifigure.png|150px|thumb|Gregory Goyle as a LEGO mini-figure]]
*Goyle is portrayed by [[Josh Herdman]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptions]] of [[Harry Potter books|''Harry Potter'']], making him one of fourteen characters to appear in all eight.
*In the books, Goyle is generally portrayed as being less intelligent than Crabbe, but in the films it seems to be the other way around.
*In {{POA|FA}}, Goyle was absent during the scene at Hogsmeade, being replaced by the original character [[Pike]]. This was due to Josh Herdman being incapable of performing such a scene due to a then-recent injury.
*Goyle is among the cast of characters who appear in all eight films, though he hardly has any lines at all.
[[File:Goyle Falls to his Death.jpg|250px|thumb|Goyle falling to his death in {{DH|F2}}]]
*In {{DH|F2}}, Goyle takes the place of Crabbe, who was written out due to drug charges against [[Jamie Waylett]]. Goyle dies in Crabbe's place; when Goyle (mirroring Crabbe in the book) tries to kill Hermione with the Killing Curse, Ron chases after him, and Goyle casts Fiendfyre in an attempt to kill him, after which (Goyle) attempts to climb to safety with Malfoy and [[Blaise Zabini]] (who plays roughly the same role as Goyle does in the book), but grabs onto a loose chair and falls into the fire. Also, at the beginning of the scene, when Harry asks Malfoy to turn back from Voldemort, Goyle insists that he stay on Voldemort's side. In addition, it is not Goyle who destroys the diadem, but Harry, who stabs it with a Basilisk Fang before Ron kicks it into the fire.<ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/jamie-waylett-won-t-return-deathly-hallows-66514 SnitchSeeker.com]</ref>
[[File:GoyleLEGOHP1-4.png|150px|thumb|Gregory Goyle in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Goyle is portrayed as being more intelligent (and even supportive of Harry at times); when Malfoy and Crabbe confront Harry after [[Mrs Norris]] gets petrified, Goyle is disapproving of their behaviour, and at the end of the same school year, he cheers for Harry until Malfoy knocks him out. Something similar happens in {{COS|FA}}, where Malfoy simply pulls [[Vincent Crabbe]] back down when about to cheer for Hagrid.
*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, unlike the film, Goyle doesn't grab onto a loose chair and climbs to safety successfully like Draco and Blaise. However, when Harry and Ron rescue Draco and Blaise, Hermione is unable to reach Goyle, who remains standing on the high ground until the Fiendfyre charges at him, killing Goyle offscreen. Contrary to canon, Goyle's in-game character is unable to perform [[Dark Arts|dark magic]]. 
*Gregory Goyle's LEGO minifigure in set 4735 features Harry Potter's face on the flip side to show that it is actually Harry, disguised by Polyjuice Potion.<ref name="lhpcharacters">{{LEGO|C}}, Page 52 ('Gregory Goyle: Slytherin Infiltrator')</ref>
