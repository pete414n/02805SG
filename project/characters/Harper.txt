'''Harper''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1992]], and was sorted into [[Slytherin]]. He was described by [[Ginevra Weasley]] as ''"an idiot"''. During the [[1996–1997 school year]], he was the reserve [[Seeker]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], and played against [[Gryffindor]] when [[Draco Malfoy]] pulled out of the squad.

==Biography==
Harper was born in the early [[1980s]].

In the early [[1990s]], Harper began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] by the [[Sorting Hat]], and was shown to share the beliefs of his peers.

In [[1996]], he became a [[Seeker]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]. He was a dirty player, deliberately ramming the opposing Seeker [[Harry Potter]] during the first [[Quidditch]] match of [[1996]] and making snide comments about [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. He quickly spotted the [[Golden Snitch]] before Harry did, possibly because Harry was furious about [[Zacharias Smith]] and he was distracted. However, when it seemed that he was about to catch it, he was put off by Harry's desperate taunt, implying that [[Draco Malfoy]] had paid Harper to play instead. Harper, in his distraction, fumbled the Snitch, costing his team the game.

==Personality and traits==
Harper appeared to share the [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] beliefs of fellow [[Slytherin]]s, as shown by his snide comments about [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] being a [[blood traitor]]. He also lacked good sportsmanship and took part in foul play, deliberately ramming Harry Potter during the first [[Quidditch]] match of [[1996]].

==Magical skills and abilities==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': As a [[Quidditch]] player, Harper was a reasonably proficient [[broomstick]] flyer. Harper appeared to have a keen eyesight, spotting the Snitch before even [[Harry Potter]] did, but being unable to catch it first. He turned to be more skilled than Draco, as Harry had to verbally distract him by shouting at him to make him lose the Snitch he almost caught.
