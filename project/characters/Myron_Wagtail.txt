'''Myron Wagtail''' (b. [[1970]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the lead singer of the [[wizarding world]]'s popular band [[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]].

==Biography==
[[File:076Wagtail.gif|thumb|Myron Wagtail on his [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]
Wagtail was born some time in the year [[1970]], in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]]. Attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from the year [[1981]] or [[1982]], he was a self-proclaimed fan of [[Jacob's sibling]] and invited them to perform with his band without the knowledge of the Hogwarts staff. The band and Jacob's sibling used [[Ismelda Murk]], [[Ben Copper]], and [[Severus Snape]] as inspiration for their concert. At this time in the 1980s, the band consisted of Wagtail, [[Kirley Duke]], and [[Orsino Thruston]]. Myron and [[Rowan Khanna]] shared an interest in postmodern existentialist fiction.<ref name="HM2">{{HM|2|The Weird Sisters!}}</ref>

Wagtail, along with his band, performed at the [[Yule Ball]] of [[1994]] held at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in honour of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], by which time the band had at least eight members.<ref name="GOF23">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Wagtail appeared to be talented with charms, as he was able to use the [[Music Spell]] to enchant instruments to play on their own accord, and could use the [[Amplifying Charm]] to amplify the sound of his voice whilst performing.<ref name="HM2"/> He was even capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name="LEGOHP"/> a clear mark of superior [[magic]]al skill and talent given the immense difficulty of casting such a powerful protective charm. 
*'''Singing''': Being the lead vocalist for the very popular wizarding band the [[Weird Sisters]], Wagtail was a very talented and capable singer and live music performer.
