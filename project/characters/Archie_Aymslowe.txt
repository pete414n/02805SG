'''Archie Aymslowe''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and president of the [[Fresh Air Refreshes Totally]] (F.A.R.T.) movement, a fringe group whose members, in direct violation of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]], refuse to wear [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] trousers in public, insisting that they "''stem the [[magic]]al flow at source.''"<ref name="WW">{{WW|clothing}}</ref>

== Biography ==
Archie attended the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]. Since the event was a large gathering of wizards, the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] wanted them to dress as Muggles. Archie himself wore a flowery female nightdress without realising that what he had chosen was inappropriate. 

However, he resisted all efforts by a [[Unidentified Ministry of Magic Wizard at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup|Ministry official]] to get him to change into a pair of pin-striped trousers, insisting that he preferred a "''healthy breeze''" around his "''privates''." [[Hermione Granger]] found this amusing, having a fit of giggles and having to duck out of the area, waiting until Archie had left to return to the others.<ref name="GOF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>
