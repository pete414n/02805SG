'''Summerby''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="OOTP26"/>

==Biography==
He was a [[Hufflepuff]] student who replaced [[Cedric Diggory]] as their [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch team|team]]'s [[Seeker]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] after Diggory's tragic death.<ref name="OOTP26">{{OOTP|B|26}}</ref>

During a match against [[Gryffindor]] in [[1996]], he was beaten to the [[Golden Snitch]] by [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], although Ginny said it was partly because he had a [[Common cold|cold]] and sneezed at the wrong time. Ginny Weasley replaced [[Harry Potter]] following his life-long ban from Quidditch by [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor]] [[Dolores Umbridge]] (although this ban was immediately lifted when Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts).<ref name="OOTP26"/>
