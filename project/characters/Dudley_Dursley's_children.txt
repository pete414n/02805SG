While the two of them played with [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]], the children's fathers, Harry and Dudley, sat silently together as they were on ''"Christmas Card"'' terms.<ref name="mtv">[http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1572399/20071019/story.jhtml 19 October 2007 J.K.

==Behind the scenes==
*Rowling once considered having Harry helping Dudley with a magical child of his own [[King's Cross Station|Platform 9 3/4]] in the epilogue of {{DH}}, but later changed her mind, stating that "any latent wizarding genes would never survive contact with [[Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]]’s DNA."<ref name="JKRS" />
