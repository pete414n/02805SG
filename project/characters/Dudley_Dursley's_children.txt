The '''two children''' of [[Dudley Dursley]] and [[Dudley Dursley's wife|his wife]] were [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]. They were occasionally visited by their [[magic]]al second cousins, the two sons and daughter of their father's cousin [[Harry Potter]]. It is unknown whether they knew of their cousins' magical heritage.

While the two of them played with [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]], the children's fathers, Harry and Dudley, sat silently together as they were on ''"Christmas Card"'' terms.

==Behind the scenes==
*Rowling once considered having Harry helping Dudley with a magical child of his own [[King's Cross Station|Platform 9 3/4]] in the epilogue of {{DH}}, but later changed her mind, stating that "any latent wizarding genes would never survive contact with [[Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]]’s DNA."
