{{Quote|She says I've got all the makings of a true Seer. I saw ''loads'' of stuff...|Parvati's interest in Divination|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}

'''Parvati Patil''' (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]), was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] of [[India]]n heritage, daughter of [[Patil twins' father|Mr]] and [[Patil twins' mother|Mrs Patil]], and the identical twin sister of [[Padma Patil|Padma]]. She was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], but her sister Padma was sorted into [[Ravenclaw]].  

Parvati became best friends with [[Lavender Brown]], with whom she shared many interests, such as a love for [[Divination]]. Parvati attended the [[Yule Ball]] with [[Harry Potter]] in [[1994]], and a year later, she joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. 

During her seventh year in [[1998]], she continued her studies at Hogwarts, when it was under the control of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the same year Parvati fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against Voldemort and his [[Death Eaters]]. It can be assumed that she survived the battle, as her name was not listed among the [[Fallen Fifty]]. If she did survive, what she did in her later life is unknown. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Parvati was born to an unnamed [[Patil twins' father|father]] and [[Patil twins' mother|mother]] as one of their twin daughters; the other being [[Padma Patil|Padma]]. She was apparently familiar with [[Pansy Parkinson]] prior to her enrollment at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

===Hogwarts years {{C|1991-1998}}===
====First year====
{{Dialogue a-b-c|Draco Malfoy|Did you see his face, the great lump?|Parvati|Shut up, Malfoy.|Pansy Parkinson|Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom? Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati.|Parvati defending [[Neville Longbottom]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

[[File:Harry Potter and first years to be sorted.png|250px|thumb|left|Parvati during her Sorting in the very back with her sister]]

Parvati began attending Hogwarts in [[1991]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house, while her identical twin sister [[Padma Patil|Padma]] was sorted into [[Ravenclaw]]. Parvati shared her dormitory with her best friend, [[Lavender Brown]], [[Hermione Granger]] and two other girls.

During her first flying lesson, Parvati came to the defence of housemate Neville Longbottom when [[Draco Malfoy]] threw away his [[Remembrall]]. [[Slytherin]] student [[Pansy Parkinson]] made fun of her for this. Later in the lesson, when Harry made a soft landing after recovering the Remembrall and subsequently found himself caught by Professor [[Minerva McGonagall]], she was quick to tell Professor McGonagall that the incident was not Harry's fault. Professor McGonagall told both Parvati and Ron Weasley to be quiet and escorted Harry away.

Parvati attended the Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match in their first year, and joined an excited Hermione in a hug after Harry's speedy capture of the [[Golden Snitch]]. Parvati also told Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom after Ron made fun of her during a Charms class.

====Second year====
{{Quote|But, Professor, you’d probably have to use Dark Magic to open it —|Parvati inquiring about the Chamber of Secrets in History of Magic|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
In her [[1992–1993 school year|second year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], during a [[History of Magic]] class, she questioned professor [[Cuthbert Binns|Binns]] on how the use of [[Dark Arts|dark magic]] would be needed to open the [[Chamber of Secrets]].

====Third year====
{{Quote|Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!|Parvati and Lavender warning Harry after a Divination class|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:LavenderParvatiReadingTealeaves.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Lavender with Parvati in a Divination Class]]

In her third year, Parvati began taking [[Divination (class)|Divination]], which soon became her favourite subject. She and Lavender grew close to [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], who believed that Parvati could be a [[Seer]] one day. During their very first lesson she alarmed Parvati by telling her to beware a red-haired man, making Parvati suspicious of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].

That year, when [[Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] taught his [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class about [[Boggart]]s, Parvati's greatest fear was revealed to be mummies, although this could be translated as a fear of death or a fear of being buried alive.

====Fourth year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?|Parvati Patil|Yes, all right then.|Harry asks Parvati to the [[Yule Ball]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[File:Yule ball4.gif|240x240px|thumb|left|Parvati at the Yule Ball with her date Harry Potter]]

Early in the year, Parvati told [[Dean Thomas]] to inform [[Hermione Granger]] that [[Rubeus Hagrid]] was looking for [[Harry Potter]].

Parvati attended the Yule Ball with Harry Potter in [[1994]]. She wore bright pink [[Parvati Patil's dress robes|dress robes]] and gold bracelets. She seemed to enjoy the attention she received for being the date of a famous wizard and was eager to dance. However, the dance she had with Harry went poorly. After being ignored by Harry, who was romantically interested in [[Cho Chang]] at the time and spent much of the ball looking at her, a by then annoyed Parvati was asked to dance by another and spent most of the evening with a [[Unidentified Beauxbatons students#Beauxbatons boy|boy from]] [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]], whom she dated for a time afterwards. It's unknown what his name is and how long they dated for, if it lasted through the summer.
[[File:B4C24M1 a lesson on unicorns.jpg|251x251px|thumb|Parvati attends a Care of Magical Creatures lesson about unicorns]]
Parvati also enjoyed Care of Magical Creatures classes when they were taught by [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] rather than [[Rubeus Hagrid]], as she felt the former was a better qualified teacher. She enjoyed the lesson on [[unicorn]]s, as did the rest of the girls in class. After the Yule Ball, both Parvati and Padma acted "very cool" towards their dates, Harry and Ron, who had basically ignored them in favour of staring at Cho and Hermione and refused to dance.

[[File:Parvati & Padma at memorial feast.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Parvati and Padma attend Cedric Diggory's memorial feast|alt=]]

At the end of the year after the final task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], Hufflepuff student Cedric Diggory was murdered on Lord Voldemort's orders. Parvati was present for Cedric's memorial feast, along with the rest of the student body. She was seen sitting next to her sister and a [[Karkaroff’s Aide|boy]] from the [[Durmstrang Institute]]. It is unknown if Parvati initially believed Harry's claim that Voldemort had returned to full power.

====Fifth year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Padma Patil|It worked!|Parvati Patil|We'll go and make some more Babbling Beverage so we can sabotage the other speakers.|Come and look for us by one of the other speakers later!|See you, Harry!|Parvati and her sister sabotage's Umbridge's speakers at Hogwarts with Babbling Beverage|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)}}
[[File:Umbridge teaching.jpg|250px|thumb|Parvati during her first DADA lesson with Umbridge|alt=]]

The twins joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] in their fifth year, and it seemed their attitudes towards Harry and Ron had somewhat mellowed. During one meeting, Parvati produced such a good [[Reductor Curse]] that she reduced a wooden table to dust. She and Lavender were quite upset that year by [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s treatment of [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], whom Umbridge dismissed. However, [[Albus Dumbledore|Headmaster Dumbledore]] managed to persuade to stay living in the castle. Parvati and Lavender were both enamoured of the new [[Divination]] professor, [[Firenze]], despite the fact that he was [[Centaur|half-horse]].

[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-da (2).jpg|249x249px|thumb|left|Parvati standing with her sister and Harry Potter during a D.A. meeting|alt=]]

Also, during her fifth year Parvati's rebellious side had really started to show after becoming a member of Dumbledore's Army.

Parvati and Lavender practised basic [[Locomotion Charm]]s, by making their pencil-cases race each other around the edge of a table in preparation for the upcoming O.W.L. exam. Her experience in the D.A. likely contributed to Parvati achieving an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. She is also known to have achieved O.W.L.s in [[Divination]] and [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]].

====Sixth year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|Hi, Parvati! Are you going to Slughorn's party tonight?|Parvati|No invite. I'd love to go, though, it sounds like it's going to be really good… You're going, aren't you?|Parvati and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] discussing Slughorn's Christmas party|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

In her sixth year, Parvati had to convince her parents not to take her and her twin sister out of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She was disappointed not to be invited to the [[Slug Club]] by new [[Potions (class)|Potions]] professor [[Horace Slughorn]]; in particular, to the [[Slug Club Christmas party|party]] he hosted at [[Christmas]], which she discussed with Hermione Granger.

[[File:Apparition lessons in the Great Hall.png|250x250px|thumb|Parvati most likely attended the sixth year [[Apparition]] lessons in the Great Hall|alt=]]

That year, Parvati also became slightly dismayed by her best friend [[Lavender Brown]]'s romance with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. Although Parvati initially was supportive of her friend's feelings for Ron, as the two seemed to whisper and giggle about him before they began going out, Parvati was put off. She was also very embarrassed by the almost obsessive degree to which Lavender threw herself into the relationship.

Lavender and Ron were often seen snogging in public, she also started getting possessive when he was with another girls. At one pint Lavender pestered [[Harry Potter|Harry]] with questions about Ron's feelings for her. As a Christmas present Lavender gave Ron a gaudy and obtrusive necklace that read "my sweetheart". Despite this setback Parvati and Lavender remained as close as ever.

[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-parvati padma.jpg|241x241px|thumb|left|Parvati and Padma prepare to raise their wands in honour of their fallen Headmaster|alt=]]

Parvati was not among the DA members who fought when Death Eaters stormed the school on [[30 June]]. As she did not make a habit of carrying  her [[Dumbledore's Army]] coin with her. Parvati was among the other students in the courtyard that raised their wands in tribute to their fallen Headmaster, after he met his death at the hands of Severus Snape. Parvati and Padma returned home with their parents the morning after [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s death at the end of the school year.

====Seventh year====
In 1998 Hogwarts was under the control of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his followers, students where brutally punished and taught different subjects, like how to use dark magic instead of defending against it. Sensing the need for rebellion yet again, like there had been when Hogwarts was under the control of [[Dolores Umbridge]], Parvati and her sister Padma both joined the reconstituted [[Dumbledore's Army]], standing up against [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] control of Hogwarts. Unlike before when trouble brewed Parvati's parents had not attempted to withdraw her and her sister from school as it had now become compulsory attendance for pure-blood and half-blood students, which the Patil sisters are likely to be.

=====Battle of Hogwarts=====
{{Quote|Dean made the most of the Death Eater’s momentary distraction, knocking him out with a Stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to retaliate and Parvati shot a Body-Bind Curse at him.|Parvati and Dean Thomas fighting Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:DA 1998.jpg|251x251px|thumb|Parvati and other D.A. members are present when [[Harry Potter]] returns to Hogwarts|alt=]]

In May, Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] returned to Hogwarts after taking the year off to destroy [[Horcrux]]es. With Harry's return, Dumbledore's Army was stronger than it had ever been. But with this return, Voldemort and his Death Eaters came looking for Harry. [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] staff and students refused to simply hand Harry over without a fight, and in return a fight is what they got. Parvati participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, fighting alongside her sister and [[Dean Thomas]].
[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|250x250px|thumb|left|Parvati and the other defenders of Hogwarts witness [[Harry Potter]]'s final defeat of Voldemort]]
During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Parvati duelled with [[Travers]], but helped Dean Thomas by shooting a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] at [[Antonin Dolohov]] to prevent him from retaliating against Dean for [[Stunning Spell|stunning]] another [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. It is unknown what happened to her after she incapacitated Dolohov. She was in the Great Hall and witnessed Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort. 

====Later life {{C|1998-?}}====
Seeing as Parvati was not listed among the casualties, it can be assumed she survived the Second Wizarding War. After the battle she most likely kept her [[Dumbledore's Army coin|D.A. coin]], as a badge of honour, as did other D.A. members. It can be assumed that she attended the [[2014]] reunion of Dumbledore's Army. 

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|I still can't work out how you two got the two best-looking girls in the year.|[[Dean Thomas]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:ParvatiPoA.jpg|247x247px|thumb|Parvati in her [[1993|third year]], age 13|alt=]]
Parvati and her sister, Padma, both had long black hair, though Parvati usually wore her hair in a plait. Both sisters were usually seen wearing silver necklaces with the letter "P" hanging from the chains around their necks and over their ties during their [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] years.

It seemed to be a confirmed fact that they had matured nicely, for they were once described by [[Dean Thomas]] to be the two ''"best-looking girls in the year"''. When Harry met up with Parvati at the Yule Ball, he also observed that she was truly a very pretty girl, being dressed in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmered at her wrists.

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Parvati|You don’t mind, do you, Harry?|Harry Potter|What?|Oh never mind.|Parvati leaving Harry at the Yule Ball|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Parvati could be seen as the less serious of the Patil twins; like her friend [[Lavender Brown]], she enjoyed gossip and fashion, and the two were often seen whispering and giggling together. They also shared a great interest in [[Divination]] and are relatively close to [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]]. 

Both girls could also be insensitive to others at times, a Gryffindor trait according to [[Ravenclaw]] [[prefect]] [[Robert Hilliard]] (albeit a stereotypically negative one). This was exemplified when they pointed and laughed at [[Luna Lovegood]]'s radish earrings and when she did not hesitate to desert [[Harry Potter]] during the [[Yule Ball]], something her sister hypocritically frowned at.

Still, Parvati was loyal to those she considered her friends. She stood up to those who treated her friends poorly, such as when she defended [[Neville Longbottom]] against [[Draco Malfoy]]'s taunts, and comforted Professor Trelawney after [[Dolores Umbridge]] fired her. Parvati was also very brave, as her Sorting into [[Gryffindor]] house and her participation in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] proved her courage and determination.

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|Parvati Patil had produced such a good Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the [[Sneakoscope]]s to dust.|Parvati's talent for offensive spells|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

*'''[[Divination]]''': Parvati's was very talented at Divination, according to [[Professor]] [[Sybill Trelawney|Trelawney]]. She achieved a high mark on her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam and advanced to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level in the [[Divination (class)|subject]], showing her proficiency in this branch of [[magic]].

*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Parvati was shown to have been talented with both defensive and offensive [[spell]]s. The spells in this field she could successfully cast included the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]], [[Reductor Curse]], and the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]]. She earned a high O.W.L. score in this subject and advanced to N.E.W.T.-level, showing her proficiency in this field.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Parvati was able to successfully cast the [[Locomotion Charm]] in preparation for the upcoming O.W.L. exam in the [[Charms (class)|subject]]. Furthermore, she was able to produce a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], an incredibly advanced and powerful protective charm which is very difficult to cast, which presumably learnt how to cast in Dumbledore's Army. 
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Parvati achieved a high mark on her O.W.L. exam in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], one of the most difficult, complex and [[Science|scientific]] branches of [[magic]]. She advanced to N.E.W.T.-level in the subject, showing she was talented in this field.
*'''[[Potion]]s''': In [[1996]], Parvati and [[Padma Patil|Padma]] successfully brewed [[Babbling Beverage]] to disturb [[Dolores Umbridge]]. However, unlike her sister, she did not continue the [[Potions (class)|subject]] at N.E.W.T.-level. 
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Parvati was an excellent duellist with considerable proficiency in [[martial magic]], proven when she duelled [[Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]], [[Travers]], and an unidentified masked [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] with the help of [[Dean Thomas]]. They most likely won the duel, because they defeated Dolohov and the Death Eater, since Travers was the only Death Eater left she and Dean probably defeated him as well. It is also highly likely that Parvati survived the battle, as her name was not given among the [[Fallen Fifty|fallen deceased]].
[[File:ParvatiPatilWand.jpg|thumb|Parvati's wand]]
==Possessions==
*'''[[Parvati Patil's wand|Wand]]''': Parvati owned a [[wand]] of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. 
*'''[[Parvati Patil's dress robes|Dress robes]]''': Parvati owned dress robes for which she wore for formal occasions, such as for the [[Yule Ball]] in [[1994]]. They were described as being a shade of "shocking pink".
*'''''[[Unfogging the Future]]''''': Being a keen student of [[Divination (class)|Divination]], Parvati owned a copy of this popular and useful [[Divination]] book, which would have been of use during her academic studies.

==Relationships==
===Padma Patil===
{{Quote|Parvati Patil's twin's in Ravenclaw, and they're identical. You'd think they'd be together, wouldn't you?|[[Hermione Granger]] regarding the Patil twins|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:PadmaPatil.png|224x224px|thumb|left|alt=|[[Padma Patil]], her twin sister]]
[[Padma Patil]] is Parvati's twin sister. It's unknown how close the two girls are. It can be assumed that they are very close, as is the case with most twins. The girls were separated once they began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], as Parvati was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] and Padma into [[Ravenclaw]]. 

Being Sorted into separate houses indicated differences in their character as Parvati appears to be less serious than her studious sister. This can be observed by the fact that Padma was one of the twelve students who was able to advance to N.E.WT.-level potions and Parvati wasn't. Despite this, they have a few things in common. They are both courageous, as they fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] along side their fellow D.A. members.

===Lavender Brown===
{{Quote|Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together, looking distressed.|Harry Potter remarking upon Parvati and Lavender|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Desk11ma2.jpg|263x263px|thumb|[[Lavender Brown]], her best friend|alt=]]

Lavender Brown was one of Parvati's roommates at Hogwarts and soon became her best friend. The two girls share many interests, including: [[Divination]], gossip, fashion, and they were both close to [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]]. They were also emotional and slightly girly, putting much stock in their physical appearances.

They were often seen around school together, giggling and whispering. Parvati initially supported Lavender in her infatuation with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] in their [[1996–1997 school year|sixth year]], but eventually became slightly dismayed with how intensely Lavender threw herself into the relationship.

Parvati was described as being bored and embarrassed by her friend's behaviour, however the two remained close. Sadly, Lavender was killed after being savaged by [[Fenrir Greyback]] in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. It is unknown how Parvati took the news, but it can be assumed she was devastated by the loss of her best friend.

===Hermione Granger===
{{Dialogue a-b|Parvati|Wow, you like your [[Quidditch]] players, don't you? First [[Viktor Krum|Krum]], then McLaggen...|Hermione Granger|I like ''really good'' Quidditch players.|Hermione's date to the Slug club Christmas party|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Hermione Granger Half Blood Prince.jpg|241x241px|thumb|left|[[Hermione Granger]], her dormmate|alt=]]

Parvati and Lavender were not as close to their other roommate, Hermione Granger, as they were to each other. Hermione did not share the girls' interests, such as [[Divination]] and gossip, which occasionally led to conflict. For example, Parvati and Lavender were both offended on [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]]'s behalf when Hermione made her disdain for the class clear in their [[1993–1994 school year|third year]].

The girls do not seem to have disliked each other. In [[1996]], when Hermione was jealous of Lavender dating [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], Parvati was noted to feel guilty over having laughed at Ron's cruel teasing of Hermione in [[Transfiguration]], and the two girls discussed Hermione's attendance of the [[Slug Club]] [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] with [[Cormac McLaggen]]. Since Parvati looked "positively agog" at Hermione sharing this news with her, it can be assumed that Hermione seldom confided in her roommates.

===Harry Potter===
{{Quote|Come on! We're supposed to dance!|Parvati's Yule ball date with Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[File:HBP promo side Harry cropped.jpg|249x249px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], her Yule Ball date|alt=]]

Parvati Patil was, like most of her fellow [[Gryffindor]] students, friendly with [[Harry Potter]]. She defended him when an angry Professor [[Minerva McGonagall]] scolded Harry for the incident in their first flying class, doing so before even [[Ronald Weasley]] did.

In fourth year, when Harry was Triwizard Champion and trying to find a date for the [[Yule Ball]], he mustered the courage to ask Parvati following his rejection by [[Cho Chang]]. Parvati blushed furiously at being asked but agreed. Parvati seemed excited by having Harry as a date, though Harry had no romantic interest in her. When asked to dance by a boy from [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]], she asked Harry whether he minded, but when it became clear Harry's attention was on Cho, she left without another word and was considerably cooler to Harry for the rest of the year. 

Parvati's attitude toward Harry mellowed by the [[1995–1996 school year|following year]], and she gave no indication as to doubting his story of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s return, unlike her fellow Gryffindors [[Seamus Finnigan]] and Lavender Brown. She, her sister and Lavender all joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] that year. Parvati learned well from Harry and mastered the [[Reductor Curse]] under his tutelage. She and Padma helped Harry to destroy the speakers [[Dolores Umbridge]] set up around school with [[Babbling Beverage]]. She and Harry interacted regularly during their O.W.L.s (due to their proximity on the alphabetical roster, they frequently sat near each other). 

In their [[1996|sixth year]], Parvati greeted Harry in a friendly manner and they shared mutual embarrassment at Ron and Lavender's exhibitionist romance. Parvati remained loyal to Harry and Dumbledore's Army, and found herself in hiding during her seventh year, later fighting in [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

===Sybill Trelawney===
{{Dialogue a-b|Parvati Patil|Professor? Professor, is there anything — er — wrong?|Trelawney|Wrong! Certainly not! I have been insulted, certainly.... Insinuations have been made against me.... Unfounded accusations levelled... but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not....|Parvati comforting an upset Trelawney|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[File:Sybill Trelawney.jpg|235x235px|thumb|left|[[Sybill Trelawney]], her favourite teacher|alt=]]

Parvati seemed to have a reasonably close relationship with [[Divination]] professor Sybill Trelawney; she had an unwavering faith in the reliability of Trelawney's predictions and was often seen comforting or supporting her when she was experiencing difficult times. 

She and [[Lavender Brown|Lavender]] became offended on the professor's behalf when Hermione made her disdain for Trelawney and the subject she taught clear in 1993. When she was temporarily sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]], Lavender and Parvati brought Trelawney some nice daffodils. Furthermore, Trelawney had told Parvati that she had the makings of a true seer.

===Dumbledore's Army===
[[File:Dumbledore's_Army.jpg|245x245px|thumb|[[Dumbledore's Army]]|alt=]]

Parvati became a member of Dumbledore's Army in her fifth year. It was an organisation founded by [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]], and led by Harry, in order to teach students [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], something that the new professor, [[Dolores Umbridge]], did not, as she believed that the students would use their magic to oppose the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

She was a friend of fellow members [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Dean Thomas]], and [[Seamus Finnigan]]. Dean and Seamus seemed to believe that Parvati and her sister, Padma, were the best-looking girls of their year. Furthermore, the romance between Ron and Lavender made both Parvati and Harry feel uncomfortable in 1996. She was also a friend of [[Neville Longbottom]] and defended him during their first year, when [[Pansy Parkinson]] insulted him.

Other members of the Dumbledore's Army were [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Lee Jordan]], [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Katie Bell]], [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Colin and Dennis Creevey]], [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Zacharias Smith]], and [[Marietta Edgecombe]]. Their relationship with Parvati is unknown.

==Etymology==
*[[Wikipedia:Parvati|Parvati]] is the name of a Hindu goddess of strength, consort of Shiva and daughter of the Himalayas. She was renowned for her beauty. ''Parvati'' translates into "she of the mountains" in Sanskrit. It may entirely be possible Parvati Patil's name, and her sister's, have been somewhat inspired by the model [[Wikipedia:Padma Lakshmi|Padma Parvati Lakshmi]].
*Padma and Parvati are also characters in [[Wikipedia:Midnight's Children|''Midnight's Children'']], by Salman Rushdie, the latter known mostly as Parvati-the-Witch. Rowling has never stated if she has read ''Midnight's Children'' or not, and these are common female names in India, so it is unclear whether or not these characters are intended as an homage to Rushdie.
*[[Wikipedia:Patil|Patil]] is a common Marathi surname in the Indian state of Maharashtra, while the alternatively spelled [[wikipedia:Patel|Patel]] is a common Gujarati surname in the state of Gujarat.

[[File:Parvati_Patil_pop_vinyl.jpg|thumb|Parvati Patil as a [[POP! Vinyl]]]]
*In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of the series, Parvati and Padma are portrayed as fraternal, rather than identical, twins. They are also shown to both be in [[Gryffindor]], whereas in the books, Padma is in [[Ravenclaw]], and they were always shown in matching outfits just like Fred and George.
*In {{PS}}, the way [[Pansy Parkinson]] addresses Parvati suggests that the two were already familiar with one another, but this is never explored.
*In {{COS}}, [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]] calls Parvati "Miss Pennyfeather".
*In the films, Parvati is first seen portrayed by actress [[Sitara Shah]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', and ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' she has been portrayed by Welsh actress [[Shefali Chowdhury]].
*In {{POA|FA}}, Parvati's [[Boggart]] is shown to be a giant [[cobra]], rather than a [[mummy]].
*Also in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', Parvati was portrayed as left-handed, but shown to be right-handed in {{OOTP|FA}}. This was because of the change of actors.
*In {{GOF|FA}}, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'' and the ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'', Parvati is shown to spend a lot of time with her twin, Padma. However, in the books, she is seldom seen without her best friend, [[Lavender Brown]]. Additionally, she is not identified minus a mention of her by Hermione and McGonagall calling her 'Miss Patil', but moviegoers would have no way of knowing they were one and the same, whereas the name 'Padma' is never spoken aloud in the films.
*In the film version of the [[Yule Ball]], Parvati wears an Indian orange blouse and a pink skirt known in India as a "Lehnga", gold bangles (known in India as Chudiyan), and had gold braided into her hair (known in India as a Parandah Braid). She also seems to be closer to [[Hermione Granger]] than she seems to be in the books, and dances with the [[Karkaroff's Aide|aide]] of [[Igor Karkaroff]] rather than a boy from [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]].
*Parvati Patil does not appear in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|final film adaptation]], but her twin sister Padma does. In {{LEGO|2}}, she appears in Year 7.
*In {{PM}}, the early names for Parvati and Padma are given with: Madhari Patel and Mati Patel.
