'''Roger Davies''' (c. [[1977]]/[[1978]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was a [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1989]]-[[1996]]. He was the [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]] and played as a [[Chaser]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Roger was born between [[1 September]] [[1977]] and [[31 August]] [[1978]]<ref name="age" /> in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]]. He had an older brother named [[Chester Davies]] who was also in Ravenclaw.<ref name="brother">{{HM}}</ref>

===Hogwarts years===
====Early years====
He began attending Hogwarts on [[1 September]] [[1989]]<ref name="age" /> and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]] house. He joined the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]] as a [[Chaser]] and eventually became their Captain.<ref name="POA13">{{POA|B|13}}</ref>

====Sixth year====
{{Quote|Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her.|Roger is Triwizard champion Fleur Delacour's Yule Ball date|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}[[File:yule ball1.gif|250px|thumb|left|Roger at the Yule Ball with Fleur]]

In [[1994]], Roger was [[Fleur Delacour]]'s date at the [[Yule Ball]]. He was very taken with the [[Half-Veela|part]]-[[Veela]] witch's beauty and charm. He was so mesmerised, in fact, that he was looking at her the whole time and did not notice what she was actually saying, as well as repeatedly missing his own mouth with his fork while trying to eat. After dancing for some time at the ball, Roger and Fleur left for the gardens, sneaking into the rose bushes for a romantic engagement.<ref name="GOF23">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref>

====Seventh year====
{{Quote|He asked me out, you know. A couple: of weeks ago. Roger. I turned him down, though.|Cho Chang regarding how Roger asked her on a date|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:CchangrdaviesGOF.png|250px|thumb|Roger and Cho Chang sitting next to each other in the Great Hall]]

According to [[Cho Chang]], Roger asked her to go out with him shortly after the death of [[Cedric Diggory]] in [[June]] of [[1995]]. She refused, as she was interested in [[Harry Potter]] at the time, though she brought this incident up to Harry when they went on a date in [[1996]] at [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]], apparently to make him jealous.<ref name="OTP25"/>

[[File:Harry And Cho PM Valentines In Madam Puddifoots.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Davies with a girl in Madam Puddifoot's teashop]]
Roger was also there with his own date for [[Valentine's Day]]; Harry watched them for clues as to what to do with Cho, whom he thought was eyeing Roger as if she wished she were with him instead. When Cho left the teashop in a dramatic and tearful fashion, Roger, along with the rest of the customers in the teashop, looked at Harry, who was left behind.<ref name="OTP25">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Davies was evidently a highly talented and accomplished [[Broomstick]] flyer, given how he managed to play for the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]] as initially the [[Chaser]] and later the team's [[Quidditch Captain]].<ref name="POA13"/>

==Relationships==
===Fleur Delacour===
[[File:Fleur_Promo.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Fleur Delacour]], his Yule Ball date who he was smitten with]]
During [[1994]], Davies attended the [[Yule Ball]] as Fleur's partner. He was apparently too smitten by her [[Half-Veela|part-Veela]] [[Veela Magic|magic]] to actually take note of anything she said, most of which was criticism of Hogwarts, while constantly missing his own mouth with the fork during dinner. The two apparently enjoyed their time together, as they had a romantic night within the bushes during the later parts of the Ball.<ref name="GOF23"/> However, they did not keep in contact after the [[Triwizard Tournament]] ended, and Fleur later married [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]].<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref>

===Cho Chang===
[[File:Cho Chang.jpg|220px|thumb|left|[[Cho Chang]], his ex-girlfriend]]
Sometime after [[Cedric Diggory]]'s death, Roger asked Cho out, to which she refused, being interested in [[Harry Potter]] at the time. Cho would later use this event to gauge Harry's feelings for her based on the jealousy he would produce, though he was only confused. Cho also watched Roger and his girlfriend holding hands and kissing over their [[sugar]] bowl in [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]], as though they were setting a standard that she expected Harry to live up to. Roger and his girlfriend stopped kissing to look at Harry in astonishment when Cho departed dramatically after an argument.<ref name="OTP25" />

===[[Roger Davies's girlfriend|Girlfriend]]===
Roger got himself a girlfriend sometime before [[1996]]'s [[Valentine's day]], and the two seemed to be passionate with their relationship, as they were holding hands and kissing frequently over their sugar bowl inside Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop.<ref name="OTP25" />

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Roger Davies was played by [[Henry Lloyd-Hughes]].

==Etymology==
Roger means "famous spear" from the Germanic elements ''hrod'' "fame" and ''ger'' "spear". The Normans brought this name to England, where it replaced the Old English cognate Hroðgar (the name of the Danish king in the Anglo-Saxon epic 'Beowulf'). It was a common name in England during the Middle Ages.
