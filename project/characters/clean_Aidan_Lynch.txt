'''Aidan Lynch''' was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who played as the [[Seeker]] for the [[Irish National Quidditch team]] during the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]].


Although his team won the World Cup with the most points, Seeker [[Viktor Krum]] caught the [[Golden Snitch]]. Lynch was fooled by Krum's use of the Wronski Feint twice during his match against Bulgaria, resulting in him being dazed for a while afterwards. During the first dive, Lynch was just knocked out for a few minutes but after the second dive, he was left dazed for a long period of time.


*Aidan shares his last name with Irish-born actress [[Evanna Lynch]], who plays [[Luna Lovegood]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]].
