'''Mundungus "Dung" Fletcher''' was a [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was involved in many illegal activities, having a notoriously disreputable reputation as a petty criminal. Despite this, many members of the Order had mixed feelings about him; however, he was very loyal to the Order's head, [[Albus Dumbledore]], who once got Fletcher out of serious trouble. 



Very little is known of Mundungus's early life, although it is known that he was born in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]] to the [[Fletcher family]] sometime before [[1962]].

When he was eleven years old, he received [[Mundungus Fletcher's wand|a wand]], and attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] for seven years. It is unknown even to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] which [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] he was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into, for reasons unknown.

During Mundungus Fletcher's [[first year]] at Hogwarts, a limited edition [[Screaming Yo-yo]] was released. Mundungus owned one, but it was confiscated by [[Argus Filch]].

By [[1 September]] of [[1998]], all of Mundungus's family had died, and he never married or had any children.



Sometime around [[1970]], Mundungus joined the newly-founded [[Order of the Phoenix]].



At some point by [[1988]], Mundungus Fletcher got the [[Marauder's Map]] by trading it with someone at Hogwarts. He was later attacked and the map got stolen from him by the attacker. He was also attacked by [[White-robed wizard|someone in white robes]], although this was a separate attack.

While [[Jacob's sibling]] was investigating [[Knockturn Alley]] with another student, [[Patricia Rakepick]] managed to capture Mundungus. She tied him up in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], where she and Jacob's sibling investigated him about the Marauder's Map.

In [[1990]], Mundungus and [[Jacob's sibling]] spied on [[Merula Snyde]] in [[Knockturn Alley]] under [[invisibility cloak]]s, where they both witnessed her speaking to [[Verucca Buckthorn-Snyde]], who was a member of [[R|The Cabal]], where Merula confessed to being a mole for the organisation and that she was prepared to join their group. This shocking realisation left them both shocked.

On [[3 August]], [[1992]], [[Arthur Weasley]] conducted a raid with the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]] in the [[British Ministry of Magic]], and when his back was turned, Mundungus tried to [[hex]] him, although perhaps luckily he was unsuccessful.

On [[26 August]], [[1994]], Mundungus attended the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], where he slept under a [[cloak]] propped up on sticks. Nonetheless, after the [[Reappearance of the Dark Mark|Death Eater riot]] that took place, he attempted to input an absurdly inflated compensation claim for damages to a twelve-bedroom tent with a built-in [[jacuzzi]], though [[Percy Weasley]], who was working at the Ministry at the time and who had seen Mundungus under the cloak-on-sticks, reported it and Mundungus did not receive anything.

When [[Professor]] [[Albus Dumbledore]] learned on [[24 June]], [[1995]] of the [[Return of Lord Voldemort|Return of the Dark Lord]], he demanded of [[Sirius Black]] that the "old crowd" be alerted to the incident, specifically naming Mundungus, [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Arabella Figg]].



With the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in [[June]] of [[1995]], Mundungus rejoined the Order of the Phoenix, but preferred to carry out business deals on stolen goods.

Mundungus was supposed to be watching [[Harry Potter]] on [[2 August]], [[1995]], but instead decided to go off to buy some stolen [[cauldron]]s. When he returned to his post, he was shouted at and attacked by [[Arabella Figg]] for deserting his duties as Harry had [[Attack in Little Whinging|been attacked]] by [[Dementor]]s and forced to defend himself and [[Dudley Dursley|his cousin]] using [[Patronus Charm|magic]] when [[Underage magic|underage]].



Mundungus stayed for supper that night at [[12 Grimmauld Place]], the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, much against the wishes of [[Molly Weasley]], who blamed him for the earlier desertion of his post. During supper, he told a joke to [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] about how he had stolen [[Will]]'s stolen [[toad]]s and then sold them back for twice what they were worth; [[Molly Weasley]] did not approve.

He got into trouble with Molly Weasley when he tried to bring his load of stolen [[cauldron]]s to Headquarters for storage. He also provided a number of controlled magical ingredients to [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], which helped them set up their magic joke shop. However, he slightly redeemed himself in [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]]'s eyes while cleaning out Grimmauld Place, when he saved [[Ronald Weasley|her son]] from a set of purple cloaks that attempted to strangle him.



When the initial meeting of [[Dumbledore's Army]] was held in the [[Hog's Head Inn]], Mundungus was present, unbeknown to Harry, and reported back to the Order. Sirius Black, revealing this to Harry, said that Mundungus was heavily veiled and disguised as a witch because he had previously been barred from the Hog's Head, and admitted that Mundungus had been tailing Harry.

During the [[Christmas]] of 1995, Mundungus managed to attend [[Christmas]] dinner at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] with the Order, in time for [[Christmas pudding]] and [[trifle]], having stolen a Muggle [[car]] to get there, as the [[London Underground]] did not run on [[25 December|Christmas Day]]. Mundungus also provided a [[Christmas tree]] for the house, which he also likely stole.

Imprisonment and escape
Apparently, since the death of Sirius in [[1996]], Mundungus had been clearing valuables out of the headquarters of the Order and selling them. Harry caught Fletcher red-handed in [[Hogsmeade]] selling Black family silver to [[Aberforth Dumbledore|the bartender]] of the Hog's Head, which had been stolen from Sirius' house; these items and the entire residence at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] were left to Harry in Sirius' will. Harry confronted him using physical force before Mundungus [[Apparition|Disapparated]] and went into hiding. His exact whereabouts were a mystery, but it was later noted in the ''Daily Prophet'' that he had been arrested and sent to Azkaban for impersonating an [[Inferius]]. He likely escaped during the mass breakout described by Kingsley Shacklebolt in [[1997]].

Battle of the Seven Potters



Mundungus, now freed from Azkaban, was set the task of being one of the six Order members who would be disguised as Harry Potter by means of [[Polyjuice Potion]] on the night Harry escaped from the Dursleys' house, so that if any Death Eaters were waiting for them they wouldn't know which Harry Potter was the real one. Mundungus was very reluctant to do this, fearing that he would be a target. Riding a broomstick behind [[Alastor Moody]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], he Disapparated immediately in terror when Voldemort pursued them, leaving Moody to be hit by the [[Killing Curse]] that had been aimed at Mundungus (disguised as Harry Potter) by Voldemort.

The remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, discussing how Voldemort had known when Harry was going to be moved, had suggested that it might be Mundungus who had leaked the secret. However, it was recalled that Mundungus had suggested the six mock Potters, and that was the one part of the plan that Voldemort had not been prepared for.


After their arrival at Grimmauld Place, and the discovery of the identity of [[Regulus Black|R.A.B.]], Hermione recalled the "heavy locket that none of them could open." Remembering that [[Kreacher]] had been stealing things back that they had been trying to discard, the Trio searched Kreacher's sleeping area with no result, and then Harry summoned Kreacher. Kreacher said that the locket was unfinished business for him, he had been told to destroy it and had not been able to. He also said that Mundungus had stolen it from him.

Hunted by Kreacher


Winning Kreacher over to his side by saying that they were planning to destroy the locket, and by giving Kreacher another locket which had been his old master's, Harry sent Kreacher out to find Mundungus. When Mundungus arrived a few days later, under threat of "persuasion" by Kreacher, he admitted to having taken the locket, but [[Dolores Umbridge]] then extorted it from him.

]]
Later, shortly before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Harry found himself in the Hog's Head and happened to see a [[two-way mirror]], twin to the one given to him by Sirius Black. The bartender, [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], said that it had been sold to him by Mundungus, and he had been using it from time to time to keep an eye on what Harry was doing.

When Harry relived [[Severus Snape]]'s memories, he saw the portrait of Albus Dumbledore, in conference with Snape, developing the plan of having multiple mock Potters to allow the escape from Privet Drive. Dumbledore said that this is Harry's only chance of escape, as Snape must give Voldemort Harry's true departure date to stay in Voldemort's inner council, and suggested that Mundungus should be the one to mention it to the Order. A memory was seen of Snape, in a pub, placing a [[Confundus Charm]] on Mundungus in order to have him propose a plan of six Order members disguising themselves as Harry with [[Polyjuice Potion]] accompanied by protectors.


Fletcher presumably went into hiding after his encounter with the trio at Grimmauld Place. He was not known to have taken part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], but it is possible that he did, without being noticed by Harry Potter. Mundungus survived the war and returned to his affairs as a disliked dealer of artefacts.

Calamity
During the [[Calamity]], Mundungus often came into the field of view of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force|SOS Task Force]]. He taught volunteers several "subtleties he learned from spotting vulnerabilities in his marks", and at [[Hog's Head Inn]] he revealed "the art of surprise".

Mundungus attempted to sell a load of "found" classics to the school. He also flooded the market with substandard [[Re'em]] blood - cut with common Ox blood. [[Calamity Investigator]]s shut down this operation. Mundungus attempted to steal from the Task Force a crate of ill-gotten [[Leaping Toadstool]]s, but fled after a fierce but brief duel.

By at least the [[2010s]], Mundungus claimed to have created song named [[Solowithmio]], and gave a performance of it to a crowd that contained a Calamity Investigator for the SOS Task Force. Unable to actually play the guitar, Fletcher was able to convince the entire crowd that he was a skilled guitarist by slipping a [[Mundungus Fletcher's potion|potion]] into the crowd's drinks. The Calamity Investigator eventually discovered this and forced Fletcher to return all of the money he had made from the "performance" to the attendees, and to teach the Calamity Investigator the brewing secrets that he used to brew the potion.


Mundungus was a short wizard with bandy legs and long, straggly ginger hair. He had bloodshot, baggy brown eyes and rarely shaved. His hands were quite grubby, and he was noted to have a particularly strong bodily odour of tobacco and [[alcohol]]. 




Mundungus was a petty and unscrupulous criminal, specialising in committing petty crimes to make as much profit as he could. He always took valuable things from wherever he went, such as [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. After [[Sirius Black]]'s death, Mundungus stole his possessions, including [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]]. He was also somewhat cowardly, as he abandoned [[Alastor Moody]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]; Moody was killed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] immediately afterwards. It is possible that Mundungus fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], because, if he did, he most likely survived the war and continued his work as an disreputable artefact dealer.

However, Mundungus appeared to be braver than people such as [[Peter Pettigrew]]. Though he had a tendency to flee when the situation seemed grim, he never actually turned against the Order of the Phoenix. Also, his crimes mainly included stealing and robbing, never directly harming or killing others, meaning he was capable of some amount of compassion and decency. He was capable of loyalty and repaying debts, if only to Dumbledore.



*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most accomplished adult wizards, Mundungus Fletcher was capable of apparating at will successfully, although he did sometimes create a loud bang whilst doing so.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Mundungus was able to conjure a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]], a highly advanced piece of [[magic]] and a mark of superior magical ability and talent given the immense difficulty of casting it.
*'''[[Martial magic]]''': While not a particularly brave man and thus prone to avoid dangerous confrontations whenever possible, be it by disguising himself in order to avoid people he would rather not cross, or when he fled the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], Mundungus was a capable duellist, but not as skilled as some. Although he was once defeated by an [[White-robed wizard|assassin]] working for [[R|a dangerous cabal]], and was unwilling to contend with the likes of [[Patricia Rakepick]], he was nevertheless one of the members of the Order on rotation that were entrusted the task of guarding [[Harry Potter]] following the [[Return of Lord Voldemort]], speaking for the confidence the Order had in his abilities to hold his own when it mattered.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Mundungus was able to perform a non-verbal [[spell]] (possibly the [[Revulsion Jinx]]) to escape the grasp of [[Harry Potter]] after Harry caught him red-handed after stealing some of Sirius' belongings outside the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] in [[1996]]. Given the high-level of difficulty required in the casting of spells non-verbally, this implies he was in fact a rather powerful and skilful wizard. 
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Mundungus possessed a degree of talent in the field of potion-making, as he invented a [[Mundungus Fletcher's potion|potion]] to make the drinker believe poorly played music sounded better than what it truly was.
*'''Asset acquisition''': A skill that Mundungus possessed in great enough aptitude that he was kept in the Order for his talent at attaining physical or informational assets. Be it an enchanted car or simply detailed information on the black market, Mundungus was a rather resourceful in his ability get his hands on whatever the [[Order of the Phoenix]] required of him. Both as a thief and informant, Mundungus was not the kind of wizard to let something useful to him or his allies out of his reach. This tendency, however, has made him a character of ill repute despite his contributions to his allies.
*'''Music''': Mundungus had some skills as an amateur musician and songwriter, having written a song titled "[[Solowithmio]]". However, he lacked the ability to play the guitar well, and had to use a [[Mundungus Fletcher's potion|potion]] to convince a crowd of people that he was in fact a skilled guitarist.



*'''[[Mundungus Fletcher's wand|Wand]]''': Mundungus owned a [[wand]], which was of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. He likely purchased his wand from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]] prior to starting his first year of [[magic]]al education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He wielded his wand throughout his adulthood, both for his career as an antiques dealer and as a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]].
*'''[[Invisibility cloak]]''': Mundungus Fletcher owned an Invisibility Cloak, which he used to make himself [[Invisibility|invisible]] in precarious situations. It is unknown how he came into the ownership of such a rare magical item.




]]
Mundungus did not have a very good relationship with the most of the Order of the Phoenix members. They did not like him, as he was a criminal, but put up with him as his criminal contacts could give him intelligence about [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]] seemed to dislike him, as she thought he would be a bad influence on [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] by telling them about his "jobs" (probably because she was afraid of her children following his example). She also told him not to smoke in the kitchen of [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. However, she stopped disliking him so much when Mundungus saved [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] from a magic cloak that attempted to strangle him. [[Arabella Figg]] disliked him too, when he abandoned his mission to watch [[Harry Potter]], who was attacked by [[Dementor]]s. Mundungus was regarded by many as a coward. He seemed to be intimidated by [[Alastor Moody]] and protested having to partner with him during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. While he seemed to get along well with [[Sirius Black]], this didn't stop him from stealing Black family heirlooms following Sirius's death.

In 1997, [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] kidnapped Mundungus in order to learn about [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]]. Mundungus told them that he had given the locket to [[Dolores Umbridge]]. This led to Harry, Ron, and Hermione infiltrating the Ministry in order to find the locket and destroy it.

The members of the Order learned about Mundungus's cowardice when he abandoned [[Alastor Moody]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]; Moody was killed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. It is unknown if Mundungus fought along with other members during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

Mundungus also has a mixed relationship with the bartender of the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], [[Aberforth Dumbledore]]. While Aberforth banned Mundungus for life from the bar for offending him twenty years ago, the two remained in touch, with Mundungus selling stolen goods to Aberforth. It was also mentioned that Mundungus was loyal to [[Albus Dumbledore]], who had helped him at some point in the past. Albus scared Mundungus a bit but nevertheless, Mundungus never betrayed him.


Mundungus seemed to have a good relationship with [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]. He smuggled them items for their joke shop, [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] in [[Diagon Alley]], behind their [[Molly Weasley|mother's]] back, including [[Venomous Tentacula]] seed, for which he charged them ten [[Galleon]]s. Fred and George nicknamed him "Dung".


*Mundungus is an obsolete term for a malodorous tobacco.
*A fletcher is an arrow-maker; one of his ancestors in the male line may have made arrows.



*Mundungus Fletcher was played by [[Andy Linden]] in . [[Daniel Radcliffe]], of course, played Mundungus during the "Seven Potters" scene. On the DVD, Andy pointed out that he was amazed by how well Dan pretended to be him.
*Mundungus's appearance in the seventh film is greatly altered from his description in the books. He is described as having shaggy hair, bandy legs and bloodshot eyes. In the film he is bald, has normal legs and his eyes are not bloodshot.
*Mundungus doesn't ever appear in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|fifth film]]. It is unknown why J.K. Rowling never told the filmmakers to do so when she told them to include [[Kreacher]], as Mundungus, like Kreacher, has a big part to play in the adventure with the locket by giving it to Umbridge. One possible explanation is that Mundungus's character was much easier to introduce later on.
*It is possible that Mundungus appears only for a brief second in . His possible appearance is the bald man behind Bill Weasley when he is being comforted by [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] because they and the rest of the [[Weasley family]] are mourning [[Fred Weasley|Fred]]'s death.
*Elizabeth Tassel, a major character in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[wikipedia:The Silkworm|The Silkworm]]'', is mentioned as having had a Doberman named Fletcher, who died before the start of the novel.
