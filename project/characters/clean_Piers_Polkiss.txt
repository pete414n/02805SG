'''Piers Polkiss''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] and [[Dudley Dursley]]'s best friend, when they were young.




, Piers Polkiss and [[Dudley Dursley]]]]
On [[23 June]] [[1991]], Dudley's eleventh birthday, Piers accompanied him, the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] and Harry to the [[zoo]]. During the trip, Piers saw Harry [[Parseltongue|talking]] to a [[Boa constrictor at the zoo|snake]] in the reptile house. When Harry was pushed out of the way, and then [[Underage magic|unintentionally]] made the [[Vanishment|glass disappear]], Piers and Dudley jumped back in surprise. When Piers told the Dursleys that Harry had been talking to the snake, they gave Harry his longest ever punishment.



During the summer of [[1995]], Dudley lied to his parents saying that he was at the Polkisses' having tea, although Piers was with Dudley's gang as they roamed the [[Little Whinging|neighbourhood]], bullying younger children.


Piers is of Anglo-Saxon heritage and means "rock". It is a variant of Peter, from the Greek for "rock". Polkiss may be a variation of Polk, which itself is a variation of the Scottish names Pogue, Pollack, or Pollock, meaning "from the pool or pit".


*Due to being Dudley's closest friend of the group, Piers was most likely the gang's second-in-command.

*It is mentioned several times in the books that all the members of Dudley's gang were big and stupid, but Piers was always described as being scrawny with a face like a rat. It is possible that Piers was scrawny when compared to the other members or that he gained a significant amount of weight after he went to the zoo with Dudley and Harry.
