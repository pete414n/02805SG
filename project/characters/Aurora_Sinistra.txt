{{Quote|Let's talk about [[Lunar phases|Lunar Phases]] again, shall we? That was a rhetorical question, by the by. My [[Astronomy Tower|Tower]], my rules. Rule number one: No sleeping during class!|Professor Sinistra's strict attitude with her students|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
'''Professor Aurora Sinistra''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who taught in the [[Astronomy]] [[Astronomy department|department]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

The professor was present at many important events throughout [[Harry Potter]]'s time at Hogwarts. In the [[1992–1993 school year]], the professor was present at the discovery of a [[Petrification|petrified]] student, [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], and helped transport him with [[Filius Flitwick]], the [[Charms Master]], to [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] in the [[Hospital Wing]].

In [[1994]], Sinistra attended the [[Yule Ball]] with "[[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Alastor Moody]]", and danced a nervous two-step, careful to avoid his wooden leg. Sinistra prepared [[fifth year]]'s for their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s by demanding large amounts of homework. She was probably good friends with [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank]], who she was found chatting with numerous times throughout the year.

It is unknown if Sinistra participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] alongside the students and fellow staff. If she did, then she witnessed the final defeat of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] at the hands of Harry Potter. It is also unknown what she did after the [[Second Wizarding War]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Little is known about Professor Sinistra's early life. She presumably excelled at [[Astronomy]] during her student years, being either [[Home-schooling|homeschooled]] by her parents/guardians or educated at a [[wizarding school]].

===Career at Hogwarts===
[[File:Sinistraminervaalbus.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sinistra, [[Albus Dumbledore]], and [[Minerva McGonagall]] singing the [[Hoggy Warty Hogwarts|Hogwarts school song]] in 1991]]
Before September 1985, Sinistra applied for a teaching position at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was accepted, becoming a [[Professor|Hogwarts Professor]]. She taught many of her lessons at midnight at the top of the [[Astronomy Tower]], the highest point of the castle. Her students each required a telescope for her lessons, and she taught all about the different stars and constellations, as well as moons and planets.

She regularly attended the [[Welcoming Feast|Start-of-Term Feast]], where she appeared to enjoy socialising with other teachers, such as [[Pomona Sprout]], the [[Herbology]] professor, and [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank]], the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor and later substitute for [[Rubeus Hagrid|Professor Rubeus Hagrid]]. She was known to give large amounts of homework to students in their [[fifth year]] and to those who continued [[Astronomy]] for [[sixth year|sixth]] and [[seventh year|seventh]].

====1985–1986 school year====
Professor Sinistra was teaching in [[Astronomy Tower]] when she became trapped in [[cursed ice]] along with the children in her class. She was later broken out of the ice by her fellow teachers.

====1989–1990 school year====
Professor Sinistra attended the [[Start-of-Term Feast]], where she informed students that she taught at midnight. She began teaching [[sixth year|sixth-year]] students at some point during the school year.

====1991–1992 school year====
[[File:Harry-potter1-aurora.jpg|250px|thumb|Professor Sinistra listening to [[Professor]] [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] give his annual speech]]
Aurora sat at Professor Dumbledore's left hand side while [[Harry Potter]] and his classmates were being [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]]. She was rather emotionless and clapped unenthusiastically.

She later attended the [[Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match (1991)|Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match]], sitting near the [[Headmaster]] again. When [[Angelina Johnson]] was fouled, she stood up with the rest of the teachers and gasped. However, when Harry Potter appeared to [[Broom jinx|lose control]] of [[Harry Potter's Nimbus 2000|his broomstick]], she did not openly show signs of emotion.

Later that year, the professor's fellow colleague, [[Quirinus Quirrell]], was revealed to be a servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] after the [[Philosopher's Stone]] which was hidden inside the school. Apparently, Sinistra was not chosen to protect the [[Underground Chambers#Sixth|Philosopher's Stone Chambers]]. She also attended the [[End-of-Term Feast]], in the same seat she was in earlier in the year, and watched as [[Gryffindor]] won the [[House Cup]].

====1992–1993 school year====
{{Quote|Justin Finch-Fletchley was carried up to the Hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department...|A petrified Justin is moved locations|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[File:MM_AD_AS.png|250px|thumb|left|Sinistra sitting with Professors [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]] at the staff table]]
During the [[1992–1993 school year]], Professor Sinistra continued her career as [[Astronomy]] teacher. This year, however, the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was opened once again, having killed a [[Ravenclaw]] student named [[Myrtle Warren|Myrtle]] in [[1943]]. Sinistra was present when [[Muggle-born]] student [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]] was discovered, petrified after an attempted attack on him by the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]]. Together, she and [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Filius Flitwick]], the [[Charms Master]], removed Justin's body and took him to the [[Hospital Wing]] where he was to be treated by [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Poppy Pomfrey]]. The Chamber was closed at the end of the year and the [[Basilisk]] slain.

====1994–1995 school year====

[[File:Weird Sisters playing at the Yule Ball.png|250px|thumb|Professor Sinistra attended the Yule Ball where she danced with [[Alastor Moody]]]]
During the [[1994–1995 school year]], the [[Triwizard Tournament]] took place at [[Hogwarts Castle]]. For the [[Welcoming Feast|Start-of-Term Feast]], Professor Sinistra sat in between [[Severus Snape]] and [[Pomona Sprout]], and was seen talking to the latter.

===Second Wizarding War===
{{Quote|[[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher... |Sinistra talking with her fellow staff members|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Harry-potter1-aurora feast.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Professor Sinistra sitting at the staff table during meal time in the Great Hall]]
The following academic year, she gave large amounts of homework to her [[fifth year]]s as preparation for their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s. One of these known pieces of homework was a project on [[Jupiter]]'s [[moon]]s; during one lesson, she specifically stated that the moon [[Europa]] is covered in [[Water|ice]], but Harry Potter either misheard her or miswrote it as [[Mouse|mice]]. Throughout the year she was seen talking to [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank]], the stand-in professor for [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher.

{{Quote|Professors [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]], [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Grubbly-Plank]], and Sinistra gave them even more homework...|Preparing fifth years for their O.W.L. exams|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
That year, Hogwarts was the reluctant host of Ministry of Magic bureaucrat [[Dolores Umbridge]], who had been appointed to the position of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher but was in reality there to undermine Dumbledore and ensure Ministry control of the school. At the Welcoming Feast, Professor Umbridge interrupted Headmaster Dumbledore's usual announcement and proceeded to make an incredibly dull speech about the Ministry and Hogwarts, at one point making a little bow to the other teachers. Professor Sinistra, like her colleagues, understood the real meaning of the speech (the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] was interfering at Hogwarts) and neither returned the bow nor applauded when the speech was over.

Umbridge was later appointed High Inquisitor by order of Minister [[Cornelius Fudge]], which gave her the power to inspect and dismiss teachers who ostensibly were not up to scratch (in reality it was a means of eliminating teachers who were either too close to Dumbledore or who taught things she felt were inappropriate). Professor Sinistra presumably endured this intrusive inspection of her classes, but evidently proved a competent teacher as she was neither sacked or placed on probation. She was also presumably among the teachers who requested Umbridge's help in getting rid of rogue fireworks in their classrooms and those who cheered her eventual departure at the end of the year.

====1996–1997 school year====
[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|The funeral of Albus Dumbledore, that Sinistra might have attended]]
At the end of the [[1996–1997 school year]] Hogwarts was invaded by [[Death Eaters]] and the students and staff where threatened. It is unknown if Sinistra participated in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] alongside students and fellow Professors. During the battle Dumbledore was killed by [[Severus Snape]] and his funeral was held within the grounds of the school. It is also unknown whether or not Sinistra attended the funeral, although it seems likely as Dumbledore was her employer.

====1997–1998 and the Battle of Hogwarts====
{{Quote|I know that you are preparing to fight. Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood. Give me Harry Potter, and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. You have until midnight.|Lord Voldemort's ultimatum|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]]]]
This year Hogwarts had fallen under Voldemort's influence. Voldemort made [[Death Eaters]], [[Amycus Carrow]] and [[Alecto Carrow]] teachers at Hogwarts. On [[2 May]] [[1998]], Voldemort and his army of Death Eaters and Dark creatures attacked Hogwarts, in order to capture Harry Potter. It is probable that she, along with the rest of the faculty, fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. If Sinistra did in fact stay to fight, then she witnessed Voldemort's final defeat and death at the hands of [[Harry Potter]] and therefore the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]].

==Physical appearance==
She often wore olive robes and a pointed hat spangled with astrological signs.

==Personality and traits==
Sinistra was a serious and strict woman. She feared the [[Dark Wizard|Dark]] [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and her [[Boggart]] assumed his form. She was also proven to have been a highly competent teacher, as her lessons inspected by [[Dolores Umbridge]] were deemed satisfactory enough that she was not subject to disciplinary action by her. Her competency as a teacher was also proven by how she taught her subject for at least ten years at Hogwarts, showing her to have been highly experienced and skilled in her field. 

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Astronomy]]''': Aurora was a highly accomplished professional [[Astronomer]] who was very knowledgeable and experienced in her [[Science|scientific]] field,  and taught the subject for at least ten years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Aurora was able to conjure a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], a very advanced piece of [[magic]] and a mark of superior magical ability, given the immense difficulty of casting such a powerful protective charm.

==Etymology==
Professor Sinistra's surname originates from the Latin "''sinister''", meaning "''left''" or "''with a direction to the left''". The most probable explanation for this is that most planets of the solar system rotate anti-clockwise. Sinistra is also the name of a star of the constellation of Ophiuchus. The contemporary meaning of the word "''sinister''" is "evil" or "menacing" and can be a synonym of "dark" (like in "dark events" for example). Here, the name "Sinistra" probably refers to the fact that Astronomy is mostly practised at night, when the sky is dark.

The first name "Aurora" indicates a relationship with the dawn, however it is probably derived from "Aurora", a phenomena which occurs when solar winds interact with the earth's magnetic field.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Aurora Sinistra.jpg|150px|thumb|Aurora Sinistra as depicted in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
*Professor Sinistra was played by an unidentified actress in the {{PS|FA}}, appearing as an unnamed background extra. In an instance of additive [[Wikipedia:retroactive continuity|retroactive continuity]], the physical appearance of this extra was later used to depict Sinistra in {{LEGO|Y1}} and, later still, in {{HM}}.
*Professor Sinistra's first name only appeared on a list of the Hogwarts professors which was released on {{JKRS}}.
*Sinistra's name was written on [[:File:Early draft workingsJKR.png|a page]] written by Rowling by the names considered for the post of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].
*Aurora's first name was originally supposed to have been Aurelia.
*Despite teaching Harry from the first-year, Professor Sinistra has only ever appeared as a background character, and does not have any lines in any of the books.
*Professor Sinistra's physical description is not given in the book. In the first film and the video games, she is depicted as a tall witch with dark hair, eyes, and skin, with a slightly circular face with cheek bones and a prominent, sharp nose. Her dark skin implies she could be of African descent, and if Professor Sinistra was born in Africa, it is possible that she attended [[Uagadou School of Magic]], whose students are known to be skilled in Astronomy.
