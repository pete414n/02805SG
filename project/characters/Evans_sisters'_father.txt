'''Mr Evans''' (died between [[1 September]] [[1971]] and [[31 October]] [[1981]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] and the father of [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]]. He had two grandsons, [[Dudley Dursley]] and [[Harry Potter]], through his daughters' marriages to [[Vernon Dursley]] and [[James Potter I|James Potter]].

==Biography==
Mr Evans and [[Evans sisters' mother|his wife]] lived in [[Cokeworth]], [[England]]. The couple had two daughters: [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]], born in the late [[1950s]], and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]], born [[30 January]] [[1960]].

The couple's elder daughter was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] like them. Their younger daughter, on the other hand, turned out to be a [[Muggle-born]] [[wizardkind|witch]]. Mr Evans and his wife were proud to have a magical daughter, but Petunia thought differently, considering her sister to be a "freak." According to Petunia, Mr and Mrs Evans favoured Lily, talking about her constantly.

On [[1 September]], [[1971]], Mr Evans and his wife took Lily and Petunia to [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]], in order to see Lily off to her first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

===Death and legacy===
Mr Evans and his wife died "normal Muggle death[s]" sometime before the murder of their daughter Lily and son-in-law [[James Potter I|James Potter]], on the night of [[31 October]], [[1981]].
