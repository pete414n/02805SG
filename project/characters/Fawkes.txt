{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Professor. Your [[bird]] — I couldn’t do anything — he just caught fire —|Albus Dumbledore|About time, too. He's been looking dreadful for days; I've been telling him to get a move on.|After Fawkes [[Burning Day|burst into flames]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
'''Fawkes''' was a highly intelligent male [[phoenix]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s animal companion and defender. Fawkes had been in Dumbledore's service for 59 years up to the Headmaster's death in [[1997]].<ref name="age 2"/>

Fawkes was instrumental in helping [[Harry Potter]] defeat [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]] in [[1993]]. His [[Phoenix tears|tears]] (which possessed [[Healing magic|healing]] properties, as with his species) saved Harry's life after his arm was punctured by the basilisk's fang and its [[Basilisk venom|venom]].<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref> In [[1996]], Fawkes came to Dumbledore's aid in fighting [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].<ref name="OOTP36">{{OOTP|B|36}}</ref>

Following Dumbledore's death, Fawkes sang his [[Phoenix Lament|Lament]] over the grounds of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and then left and flew away, never to be seen again.<ref name="HBP29">{{HBP|B|29}}</ref> 

His tail feathers were the cores of the two twin [[wand]]s which were held by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="GOF36"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Much of Fawkes's origins are unknown, but at some point in or prior to [[1938]], two of his tail-feathers were procured by the wand maker [[Garrick Ollivander]], and fashioned into the [[Wand core|cores]] of two wands (a rare event, as should the two meet, it would initiate [[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]]), made from [[yew]] and [[holly]]. The [[Tom Riddle's wand|yew wand]] went to [[Tom Riddle]] and the [[Harry Potter's wand|holly wand]] went to [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="GOF36"/>

Fawkes had not been owned by another wizard prior to [[Albus Dumbledore]], and thus spent his early life as a wild phoenix.<ref name="accio">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-edinburgh-ITVcubreporters.htm Edinburgh "cub reporter" press conference, ITV, 16 July 2005]</ref>

===Service to Dumbledore===
[[File:Fawkes and Dumbledore in the Headmaster's Office COSF.jpeg|250px|thumb|left|Fawkes sitting on his perch in Dumbledore's office]]
Dumbledore and Fawkes met sometime before 1938,<ref name="age 1">Dumbledore says that Ollivander wrote to him when Harry's wand was purchased; if Dumbledore did not have Fawkes before 1938, he would not know about the two feathers being in the wands, so Fawkes and Dumbledore must have met and bonded before 1938</ref> and Fawkes lived with and faithfully served the famed wizard for at least 59 years.<ref name="age 2">There are 59 years between 1938, by which point Fawkes was already with Dumbledore, and [[1997]],in which Dumbledore died, so they were together for at least 58 years</ref> As part of his efforts to help Harry in his quest to defeat and kill the [[Dark Wizard]] Voldemort and his followers, Dumbledore called Fawkes into battle whenever needed.<ref name="OOTP36"/> Throughout the years, there were several instances where Fawkes was extremely helpful.

====1992–1993 school year====
{{Quote|As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake. Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the Basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabres — Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sunk out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor.|Fawkes saving Harry from [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Fawkesbabyhd.jpg|250px|thumb|Fawkes reborn after a [[Burning Day]]]]
In [[1992]], whilst in [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Headmaster's Office|office]] for the first time, [[Harry Potter]] encountered Fawkes on his [[Burning Day]]. Fawkes appeared very ill, decrepit and baleful, and much to Harry's initial shock and horror, burst into [[Fire|flames]] in front of his eyes. When Dumbledore entered, Harry explained to Dumbledore what had just happened to his [[bird]], but Dumbledore calmly explained to Harry that Fawkes was a phoenix and thus was [[Immortality|immortal]], and that he had been looking "dreadful for days". Dumbledore explained to Harry the various potent [[magic]]al powers of the phoenix and they both watched him rebirth from his ashes.<ref name="COS12">{{COS|B|12}}</ref>

[[File:Fawkes blinds basilisk.gif|250px|thumb|left|Fawkes blinding the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets]]
In [[29 May]] [[1993]], Fawkes saved [[Harry Potter]]'s life from the [[Serpent of Slytherin]], blinding the [[Basilisk]] and dropping the [[Sorting Hat]] into Harry's lap, which in turn revealed [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's Sword]]. Harry then used the sword to slay Slytherin's Basilisk. Fawkes shed [[Phoenix tears|healing tears]] upon Harry's wounds, inflicted by the Basilisk before its death, and cured him of its [[Basilisk venom|venom]]. Fawkes then dropped [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's Diary]] into Harry's lap, giving Harry the chance to destroy it with one of the [[Basilisk venom|basilisk's fangs]]. As a phoenix can lift a great weight with its tail in flight; when Harry grasped Fawkes's tail in the [[Chamber of Secrets]], he felt as if he were becoming weightless — which is saying something, as [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] were in turn hanging on to him.<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref>

[[File:Fawkes flight GIF.gif|250px|thumb|Fawkes the phoenix carrying [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart]] out of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]]]
Later, in his office, Dumbledore revealed where Fawkes had come from — when the memory of Tom Riddle declared that he would go on to become the greatest sorcerer in the world, Harry responded that "''Albus Dumbledore is the greatest wizard in the world''!", and went on to ridicule Voldemort's supposed fear of Dumbledore during the [[First Wizarding War]]. This act of supreme loyalty was apparently enough to summon Fawkes to the Chamber.<ref name="COS18">{{COS|B|18}}</ref>

====Post-tournament comfort====
After Harry witnessed Voldemort's resurrection and [[Cedric Diggory]]'s death, Fawkes was present when Harry told Dumbledore and [[Sirius Black]] what had taken place. During this conversation, Dumbledore revealed that Fawkes was the phoenix who had donated his tail feathers to Harry and Voldemort's wands, while Fawkes used his tears to heal the wound in Harry's leg that was caused by an [[Acromantula]] in the third task of the [[Triwizard Tournament|tournament]].<ref name="GOF36">{{GOF|B|36}}</ref>

====Order of the Phoenix====
{{Quote|Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him. Dumbledore released Harry, raised his hand, and grasped the phoenix’s long golden tail. There was a flash of fire and the pair of them had gone.|Fawkes departing with Dumbledore via [[Apparition]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:B5C27M3 Dumbledore's escape.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Fawkes helping Dumbledore escape from Ministry officials]]
In late [[1995]], Fawkes served as a means of communication between members of the Order and Dumbledore, after learning [[Arthur Weasley]] had been attacked by Voldemort's snake, [[Nagini]], while Arthur was guarding [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|The Prophecy]].<ref name="OOTP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>

In mid-[[1996]], Fawkes departed from Hogwarts with Dumbledore when [[Cornelius Fudge]], along with [[Dolores Umbridge]], and [[John Dawlish]], tried to arrest the latter for supposedly planning to overthrow the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], through [[Dumbledore's Army]].<ref name="OOTP27">{{OOTP|B|27}}</ref>

====Battle of the Department of Mysteries====
{{Quote|Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide, and swallowed the jet of green light whole. He burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled, and flightless.|Fawkes swallowing a Killing Curse for Dumbledore|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
During Dumbledore's [[Duel in the Ministry Atrium|duel]] against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in the Ministry Atrium in [[1996]], Fawkes swallowed a [[Killing Curse]] intended for Dumbledore, thus giving Dumbledore time to defend himself against Voldemort's second oncoming attack. He burst into flame upon swallowing the curse and was later reborn from the ashes.<ref name="OOTP36"/> He was later returned to Dumbledore's office after Harry Potter was sent there, following his departure from the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="OOTP37">{{OOTP|B|37}}</ref>

===Departure===
{{Quote|Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before; a stricken lament of terrible beauty... They all fell silent. Fawkes's lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside.|The Phoenix Lament|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Fawkes leaves.jpg|250px|thumb|Fawkes flying away from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]]]
After Dumbledore died during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] in [[1997]] at the assumed hands of Severus Snape, Fawkes sang his [[Phoenix Lament|Lament]] to the assembled mourners. This Lament affected all with its beauty. Fawkes subsequently left Hogwarts, as his ties to the school were now dead.<ref name="HBP29">{{HBP|B|29}}</ref> He never returned and became a wild Phoenix once more.<ref name="accio"/>

===The Calamity===
During the [[2010s]], Fawkes appeared as a [[Foundable]] during the [[Calamity]]. Volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] were able to free him, allowing Fawkes to return to his original time.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
Fawkes had crimson feathers on his body and a golden tail as long as a peacock's. He was roughly the size of a {{Wplink|swan}}. His claws and beak were gleaming gold — the latter was "long" — and his eyes were black. The scarlet body feathers glowed faintly in darkness, while the golden tail feathers were hot to the touch, though it is unknown if they were actually capable of burning someone as neither Harry — when Fawkes carried him from the Chamber of Secrets in 1993<ref name="COS17"/> — nor Dumbledore — when he escaped the Ministry officials with Fawkes's help in 1996<ref name="OOTP27"/> — were burned by his tail feathers, however it is possible that Fawkes could control the temperature of his tail feathers and had chosen not to burn them.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Fawkes. You were fantastic, Fawkes...|Harry congratulating Fawkes's bravery in the Chamber of Secrets|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
Fawkes served as [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s messenger and his constant companion, forming a close bond with the old wizard. Fawkes was also affiliated with [[Harry Potter]] and the members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and was the inspiration for its name.

Fawkes was extremely loyal and courageous, as displayed by his attack on [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]]<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref> and his defence of Dumbledore during his [[Duel in the Ministry Atrium|duel with Voldemort]].<ref name="OOTP36" /> Considering he came back to life every time he died, he had no reason to fear death and was therefore willing to sacrifice himself for people who won his loyalty.

He was also shown to be highly intelligent, being capable of understanding Dumbledore and bringing Harry the [[Sorting Hat]] and the [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|diary]] when he needed them.<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref>

After Dumbledore's death, he returned to the wild with no ties to another [[human]].<ref name="accio"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
[[File:Phoenix Tears GIF.gif|250px|thumb|Phoenix tears had healing powers]]
*'''[[Immortality]]''': Like all phoenixes, Fawkes was immortal. He periodically died by bursting into flames (an event called a "Burning Day"), and was then reborn from the ashes.<ref name="COS12"/> He was also immune to the gaze of a Basilisk, making phoenixes the only known creatures to be unaffected by the deadly serpent's gaze.<ref name="COS17"/> Additionally Fawkes was able to swallow Lord Voldemort's Killing Curse and was quickly reborn.<ref name="OOTP36"/>
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Fawkes was also able to heal most injuries simply by crying on them. [[Phoenix tears]] were the only known cure for [[Basilisk venom]], which he used to heal [[Harry Potter]]'s infected wound after the [[Skirmish in the Chamber of Secrets]] in [[1993]].<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref> In [[1995]], he used his healing tears to cure Harry again of the effects of [[Acromantula venom]].<ref name="GOF36">{{GOF|B|36}}</ref>
{{Quote|There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone.|Fawkes Apparating via fire|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Dumbledore_escape.gif|250px|thumb|Fawkes Apparating with [[Albus Dumbledore]]]]
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Being a phoenix, Fawkes had the natural ability to Apparate at will, disappearing and reappearing in a flash of [[fire]]. Much like the [[House-elf|house-elves]], he could do so regardless of the anti-Apparition enchantments surrounding Hogwarts. This may be because the Hogwarts enchantments applied only to humans. Fawkes could also take people along with him, as well as remotely teleport one of his feathers and send it to a distant location as a form of signal or warning.<ref name="OOTP27"/>
*'''[[Phoenix Lament|Phoenix song]]''': Fawkes also possessed remarkable and soul-touching singing talents.<ref name="HBP29">{{HBP|B|29}}</ref> A single note of his song was said to have effects similar to swallowing a drop of warming liquid, and instilling courage and calm. Phoenix song was reputed to increase the courage of the pure of heart and strike fear into the heart of the impure.
*'''[[Superhuman strength|Super strength]]''': As a phoenix, Fawkes could carry immensely heavy loads. For example, he carried the combined weight of [[Harry Potter]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] out of the [[Chamber of Secrets]].<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref>
*'''Physical combat''': Although phoenixes were gentle and were not known for fighting, Fawkes was able to blind the [[Serpent of Slytherin]] in the [[Chamber of Secrets]] by gouging out its eyes, showing he had clear ability in physically wounding his opponents.<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Quote|It’s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day. He’s really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.|Dumbledore's affection for Fawkes|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|237x237px|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his beloved owner]]

Fawkes had a very close relationship with [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Dumbledore cared for Fawkes after each of his rebirths, and in return he was very faithful to the elderly wizard. Fawkes protected Dumbledore in his [[Duel in the Ministry Atrium|duel]] with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in the ministry atrium in 1996 by swallowing a [[Killing Curse]] aimed at him,<ref name="OOTP36" /> and teleported Dumbledore away from the school when the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] attempted to arrest him in [[1996]], for supposedly building an army (Dumbledore's Army) in what the minister [[Cornelius Fudge]] believed to be an attempt to overthrow the Ministry of Magic.<ref name="OOTP27">{{OOTP|B|27}}</ref>

When Dumbledore died in 1997, Fawkes sang a [[Phoenix Lament|lament]] for his now deceased master that was described as both sad and beautiful, then left the school forever.<ref name="HBP29">{{HBP|B|29}}</ref> Dumbledore also named the Order of the Phoenix after his beloved friend and champion.

===Harry Potter===
{{Quote|Harry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee. The [[phoenix]] had fluttered to the floor. It was resting its beautiful head against Harry's injured leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider. The pain vanished. The skin mended. His leg was repaired.|Fawkes heals an injured and pained Harry|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}[[File:Harry_Potter_movies_hbp_promostills_6.jpg|238x238px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], close friend of Fawkes]]

Fawkes aided those who were loyal to Dumbledore, such as [[Harry Potter]]. In [[1993]], he brought the [[Sorting Hat]] to Harry in the [[Chamber of Secrets]], and defended him from [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]] by pecking out its eyes. When a fang pierced Harry's arm and poisoned him with its [[Basilisk venom|venom]], Fawkes used his [[Phoenix tears|tears]] to heal the wound, saving Harry's life. He then brought the [[Horcrux]] [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|diary]] to Harry so he could destroy it.<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref> 

Harry frequently greeted Fawkes when he visited Dumbledore's office and Fawkes also healed his [[Acromantula venom]] wounded leg after he escaped Lord Voldemort during his fourth year<ref name="GOF36">{{GOF|B|36}}</ref>. Harry was deeply mournful when Fawkes left Hogwarts, given his immense loyalty and service to him over the years.<ref name="HBP29">{{HBP|B|29}}</ref>

It should be noted that Harry's wand happened to be made with one of Fawkes's tail feathers. Whether this had anything to do with his bond with Harry or whether it was simply a coincidence is unknown. Lord Voldemort was the only other known wizard who had a wand made from one of Fawkes's feathers.<ref name="GOF36"/>

==Etymology==
Fawkes is named after {{w|Guy Fawkes|Guy Fawkes}}, since he periodically explodes (in order to be reborn from the ashes, like all phoenixes), a joke on the author's part.

Fawkes' name in Chinese (''佛客使'') is translated to "Buddha" in English. This is connected to Fawkes being immortal as he has the ability to transcend death by regenerating from his ashes, and Buddhas can live on even after their physical bodies die, as they come from a transcendent realm.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Fawkessketch8.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Concept art for the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|second film]] of Fawkes on a [[Burning Day]]]]
*In the films, Fawkes was made by a mechanical machine. When [[Richard Harris]], who played Dumbledore at that time, saw the robot, he said: "They sure do train those things well." He was thinking that it was a real bird.<ref>''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)#Home Video Release Dates|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: Ultimate Edition]]''</ref>
*{{PM}} has a feature on bringing Fawkes to life.
*The fact that Fawkes, who sacrificed to save Dumbledore's life at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], didn't come to his aid at the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] hints to the true nature of the headmaster's death, meaning he was killed by his own orders.
