'''Lucian Bole''' He was a [[Beater]] on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] in the [[1993–1994 school year]].

==Biography==
Lucian Bole started his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1988]], he was sorted into the house of [[Slytherin]] and became a member of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], playing the role of beater.

During the final match between [[Gryffindor]] and Slytherin in his sixth year, Bole clubbed Gryffindor [[Chaser]] [[Alicia Spinnet]], claiming he had mistaken her for a [[Bludger]]. In revenge, [[George Weasley]] elbowed Bole in the face, leading [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] to give both teams penalties.

In Bole's seventh year, the [[Triwizard Tournament]] lead all [[Quidditch]] games at Hogwarts to be cancelled, but he nonetheless nominally retained his position on the Slytherin team until his graduation in June 1995. He and fellow Slytherin Beater, [[Peregrine Derrick]], were replaced by [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] at the beginning of the next Quidditch season. [[Angelina Johnson]], the new captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], was glad to see Bole and Derrick gone, stating mockingly that she was always stunned the pair were able to find their way to Quidditch pitch without directions.

==Personality and traits==
Lucian Bole, like many fellow members of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], was shown to possess poor sportsmanship and a preference for committing fouls against rival players.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Despite his unreasonable behaviour on the Quidditch pitch, Bole was nonetheless evidently an accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, as he played as [[Beater]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]].

==Behind the scenes==
*This character is known only by his surname in the [[Harry Potter books|''Harry Potter'' books]]. His first name is given as "Lucian" in the video game {{QWC}}.
*It is possible that Bole is the [[Unidentified Slytherin Beater]] seen in {{PS|FA}}, meaning he could have played in the [[1991–1992 school year]].
