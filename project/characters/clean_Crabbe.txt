'''Mr Crabbe''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Pure-blood]] [[Dark Wizard]], a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], and the father of [[Vincent Crabbe]].



Mr Crabbe was born into the [[Crabbe family]], a [[Pure-blood]] Wizarding family. He was possibly related to [[Irma Crabbe]], wife of [[Pollux Black]].


Crabbe was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] during the [[First Wizarding War]] and was loyal to his master up until his downfall. In the aftermath, Crabbe was inaccurately acquitted of being a Death Eater by the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. Around the downfall of Voldemort, Crabbe and his wife had a baby boy, [[Vincent Crabbe]], who would be educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] from [[1991]]-[[1998]], and he became friends with [[Gregory Goyle]] and [[Draco Malfoy]].


Crabbe was one of the few Death Eaters who returned to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] when he rose to power again in [[1995]]. Voldemort was displeased when he learned that Crabbe didn't attempt to find him, but he forgave him.

During the [[Second Wizarding War]], Crabbe participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in [[1996]], and was paired with [[Rabastan Lestrange]] during the pursuit of the six [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members. He went with Lestrange to try and capture Harry, Hermione, and Neville, who were hiding in the [[Time Room]]. He was likely imprisoned in Azkaban, but re-escaped in [[1997]].

During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] the following year, Crabbe's son Vincent (who had also become a [[Dark Wizard]]) died by the effects of his own [[Fiendfyre]] [[curse]]. Crabbe's reaction over his son's death is unknown if he was even aware of it at all. Crabbe likely fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] as well, although his presence in this battle is unconfirmed.


Crabbe was presumably killed or imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] after Voldemort's final death and defeat.


Much like his son, Crabbe was a large muscular man, and spoke with a dull voice.


He appeared to be rather unintelligent and slow-witted, but he was cunning enough to avoid [[Azkaban]] after his master's first downfall. Though he bowed sycophantically before Voldemort, his loyalty was highly questionable as he did not attempt to find his master when he disappeared. Like most Death Eaters, he was very sadistic and bloodthirsty, as he was willing to use the [[Killing Curse]] on [[Hermione Granger]] who was a teenager, during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], showing he had no qualms about harming innocents.


*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, Crabbe was highly proficient in dark magic, including with the casting of the [[Unforgivable Curses]] and other [[dark charm]]s. He was confident of his ability to murder [[Hermione Granger]] with the [[Killing Curse]] in [[1996]], a [[curse]] which requires much skill and malice to cast successfully.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Being a Death Eater, Crabbe would have been highly trained in [[Martial magic]] and therefore a reasonably competent duellist, and likely participated in many battles during the [[First Wizarding War]]. He later participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], where he fought against [[Dumbledore's Army]] and the [[Order of the Phoenix]].
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Crabbe was accomplished in apparition, as he was able to apparate to the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]] to witness the [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] of his master in [[1995]].


*It is not specified if Crabbe attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].
*In , Crabbe was played by [[Paschal Friel]].
*It's likely that he was the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] whose head turned into that of a baby during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. This essay states that either he or Rabastan Lestrange were the most likely Death Eaters in the Time Room. Though not identified, this Death Eater was large and had black hair (descriptions that apply to his son, [[Vincent Crabbe]]) and was not recognised by Harry Potter. As his partner [[Rabastan Lestrange]]'s appearance was known by Harry, he likely would've been identified.
