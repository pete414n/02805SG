'''Madame Yvette Coquelot''' (fl. [[1869]]) was a [[France|French]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who presumably ran an establishment in [[69 Boulevard des Galantes]], in [[Paris]]. There was a plaque at [[The Seven Swans]] pub in [[Godric's Hollow]] requesting patrons to "discharge their weapons before entering", crediting Mme Coquelot as its original owner.<ref name="Potterish">[http://galeria.potterish.com/displayimage.php?album=4714&pid=211740#top_display_media "RdM - Fotos Oficiais de Cenários e Objetos" (DH - Sets and Objects Official Photos)] at [http://galeria.potterish.com/index.php Galeria Potterish]</ref>

==Etymology==
*'Yvette' is the female form of the name Yves meaning Yew tree.
*'Yvette' is also a Quebec term for a docile obedient housewife who votes against sovereignty.<ref>{{wikilink|Quebec referendum, 1980#Brunch des Yvettes}}</ref><ref>{{wtlink|Yvette}}</ref>
*'Coquelot' is likely a contracted form of the word ''coquelicot'' or a variant of ''coquelet'', meaning small cockerel or male baby chick.<ref>{{wtlink|coquelet}}</ref>. The word ''coquelicot'' means "poppy" since poppies are red like a rooster's chest.<ref>{{wtlink|coquelicot}}</ref> The French word for rooster is ''coq''.
