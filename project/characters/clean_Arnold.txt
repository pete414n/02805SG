'''Arnold''' was [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]'s purple [[Pygmy Puff]], or miniature [[Puffskein]].


Arnold was purchased from Ginny's brothers [[Fred and George Weasley]] at [[Weasley's Wizard Wheezes|their shop]] in August of [[1996]]. Arnold was transported in a cage during the car ride from [[The Burrow]] to [[King's Cross Station]] on [[1 September]] 1996.

In the [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor common room]] in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] he was seen playing with Ginny or riding her shoulder. It is likely that he was taken with the Weasleys when the family went into hiding in the spring of [[1998]].


Ginny's father, [[Arthur Weasley]], was mistakenly called "Arnold Weasley" in a [[FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC|1994 ''Daily Prophet'' article]] written by [[Rita Skeeter]]. "Arnold" is also an anagram of "Ronald", a possible reference to [[Ronald Weasley|Ginny's older brother]].


*In the novel he is purple, but in , he is pink.
*In  Ginny has Arnold already in [[1995]] and the player can use him in the levels.
*According to the Hogwarts [[Shopping List|supply list]], students are allowed to take an [[owl]], a [[cat]], or a [[toad]] to Hogwarts. However, it seems that Ginny was allowed to take her pygmy puff like her [[Ronald Weasley|brother]] was able to bring his [[rat]].
