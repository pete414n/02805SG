'''Petunia Dursley''' (née '''Evans''') (pre [[1960]]–pre [[2020]])<!--Do not change this. "Fl" is the abbreviation of "floruit", a Latin verb meaning "flourished". It denotes the period of time Petunia was active, since her dates of birth and death are unknown.--> was an [[England|English]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] woman, the elder daughter of [[Evans sisters' father|Mr]] and [[Evans sisters' mother|Mrs Evans]] and the sister of the [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]]. During her childhood, she became resentful of her sister for being a witch, broke off contact with her sister and refused to have any contact with the [[wizarding world]].

She married a Muggle, [[Vernon Dursley]] and they had a son, [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]. However, when Lily was murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], Petunia became guardian of her nephew, [[Harry Potter]], who was only an infant then. She neglected and treated him cruelly for the most part (mainly due to her aversion to the Potters being wizards), and confined him to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs (although she allowed him a room of his own after receiving his acceptance letters to Hogwarts in order to attempt to trick Hogwarts into not sending letters).  

In [[1991]], when [[Rubeus Hagrid]] came and said that Harry would go to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], she became very angry at the fact her nephew had discovered his true magical heritage. She and her family left their home in [[1997]] in order to be protected from Lord Voldemort and his [[Death Eaters]]. 

After the [[Second Wizarding War]], her son married and she had [[Dudley Dursley's children|two grandchildren]]. Through her nephew's marriage to [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], she had two great-nephews, [[James Potter II|James Sirius]] and [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus Potter]], the former named after [[James Potter I|her late brother-in-law]], and a great-niece, [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]], named after her late sister.

She died sometime before 2020, although the cause of death and when exactly she died was unknown.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that... that school — and came home every holiday with her pockets full of frog-spawn, turning tea-cups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was... a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!|Petunia regarding her's and Lily's childhood|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Petunia was the eldest child of [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] [[Evans sisters' father|Mr]] and [[Evans sisters' mother|Mrs Evans]] and had a sister, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]]. However, Lily had many unusual abilities, such as making a flower's petals move without touching them, which her sister viewed with a mixture of envy and disapproval -- these emotions were heightened when her parents praised Lily for her [[magic]]al abilities more and more and Petunia got even more jealous.

[[File:Petuna and lilly.png|250x250px|thumb|left|Petunia and her younger sister Lily as children]]

[[Severus Snape]] was a boy who also lived in the town of [[Cokeworth]] who possessed similar abilities and the two (Petunia and Snape) treated each other disdainfully. Lily, however, was intrigued by Snape and soon became good friends with him. Snape, later on, also developed a crush on Lily, which Petunia may have known about or not. If she did, it was likely she was scornful of it.

When Lily received a letter from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] confirming that she was a witch, Petunia [[Petunia Evans's letter to Albus Dumbledore|wrote]] to [[Albus Dumbledore]] asking if she could also study there too. Dumbledore responded saying that Petunia could not study at Hogwarts due to her being a Muggle and even though he responded kindly, Petunia felt hurt and left out. From that point on, Petunia wanted nothing to do with magic or the wizarding world and frequently called Lily a "freak".

===Marriage===
{{Quote|When, in due course, Vernon Dursley proposed marriage, very correctly, on one knee in his mother’s sitting room, Petunia accepted at once. The one fly in her delicious ointment was the fear of what her new fiancé would make of her sister, who was now in her final year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.|Petunia's predicament with Vernon|Pottermore}}
At some point in the early [[1970s]], Petunia left her home in [[Cokeworth]] to pursue a typing course in [[London]]. This led to her getting a clerical job, where she met [[Vernon Dursley]], a junior executive whose complete ordinariness she found appealing. Vernon also took a fancy to Petunia and the two went on a number of dates, which mainly involved Vernon discussing himself and his narrow views of the world.

Vernon proposed to Petunia in his mother's sitting room in late [[1977]]. Petunia gladly accepted, but secretly worried what Vernon would think when he met Lily, who was then in her seventh year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She eventually told Vernon about Lily being a [[wizardkind|witch]] on a date in his car that was parked overlooking a chip shop from which they had purchased battered sausage and while he was shocked, he assured her he would not hold it against her.

The couple's first meeting with Lily and her boyfriend [[James Potter I|James Potter]] went poorly. Vernon tried to impress James with the car he drove and when James responded by describing his [[broomstick|racing broom]], Vernon assumed he must be living on unemployment benefits. James told Vernon about his parents' fortune in [[Galleon]]s, but since Vernon could not tell whether he was being had on or not, he became angry. The evening ended with Vernon and Petunia storming out of the restaurant and Lily bursting into tears.

[[File:Dursley Wedding Photo.png|212x212px|thumb|Petunia's and Vernon's [[Wedding of Vernon Dursley and Petunia Evans|wedding]] portrait]]

Petunia and Vernon were married and settled at [[4 Privet Drive]] in [[Little Whinging]], [[Surrey]] by the end of [[1977]]. Fearing that she would be overshadowed, Petunia refused to have Lily as a bridesmaid, which upset Lily. At the reception, Vernon would not talk to James, but insultingly described him as "some [[magician]]" within his earshot.

Petunia had little contact with her sister thereafter. She and Vernon chose not to attend James and Lily's [[Wedding of James Potter I and Lily Evans|wedding]] and the last piece of mail Lily sent her was an announcement of her son [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s birth on [[31 July]], [[1980]], which she took one look at and promptly threw away.

Petunia and Vernon's only child, a son named [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]], was born on [[23 June]], [[1980]]. The couple took pride in being a "normal" family who had birthed a normal son, unlike Lily and her family.

===Housing her nephew===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Vernon Dursley |Their son... he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?|Petunia|I suppose so.|What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?|Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.|A negative discussion of their nephew|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

[[File:Baby Harry Left At Privet Drive.png|250x250px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]] is left on the Dursleys' doorstep]]

Everything changed on the morning of [[2 November]], [[1981]], when Petunia opened her door to find a baby abandoned on her doorstep. The child turned out to be her nephew, Harry Potter. [[Albus Dumbledore's letter to Petunia Dursley|A letter]] had been left by [[Albus Dumbledore]], explaining the circumstances of Harry's arrival, including the death of both her sister Lily and her brother-in-law James.
[[File:Vernonandpetuniaiu.png|250x250px|thumb|Petunia and her husband in their bedroom at Privet Drive]]
Petunia, despite taking him in, did not treat him very well at all. The boy's mere existence gave Petunia a constant reminder of her sister and the world she herself had been excluded from. She kept Harry in the [[Cupboard Under the Stairs]] as a bedroom for much of his childhood. She made a point of showering Dudley with gifts while completely ignoring Harry as a reference to how she feels she was treated as a child, but this time with a Muggle being superior. 

She also forced Harry to do all of the chores around the house, while Dudley was free to do anything he pleased and never did chores. Petunia also told Harry that his parents had died in a car crash and that the scar on his forehead came from that same accident. She did not let Harry ask any questions about his family, nor generally any questions at all for that matter.

===Contact with the wizarding world===
====Hogwarts letters====
{{Dialogue|Petunia|Vernon, look at the address... how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?|Vernon Dursley|Watching... spying... might be following us.|After Harry Potter's Hogwarts letter arrived|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Harry-potter1-dudley letters.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A scared Petunia and Dudley after their home is invaded by numerous Hogwarts letters]]
When Harry's Hogwarts letter arrived in [[1991]], she supported her husband's decision to keep the truth from Harry. They constantly tried to burn or rip up the letters, but they found that nothing was helping to stop the letters coming to Harry, so Petunia and the rest of the family moved to different places in an effort to outrun this wizarding post, until finally they were tracked down by [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. 

When Hagrid forced the issue of Harry's origin, Petunia lost control and let loose all of the resentment she had held in about Lily's life. She referenced Lily's death by referring to her as "being blown up". She also became horrified when Hagrid gave Dudley a [[Human to pig spell|pig's tail]] after Vernon insulted [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Harry decided to enrol in Hogwarts to leave his miserable life and the Dursley's abuse and left with him to visit [[Diagon Alley]]. 

Just before Harry was to leave Privet Drive to the Hogwarts Express, she and Vernon had Dudley taken to a [[London private hospital|private hospital in London]] to have Dudley's [[Human Transfiguration|transfigured]] tail removed and agreed to take Harry to [[King's Cross Station]] simply because it was already part of their journey. When they believed Harry would be unable to travel due to [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]] not logically existing, they left Harry at the station spitefully laughing among themselves, believing he would be left stranded. However, Harry managed to successfully find the platform by conveniently meeting the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], a [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] family who showed him how to reach the concealed platform, allowing him to go to Hogwarts.

====Dinner party====
[[File:Dursleys have visitors.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Vernon and Petunia entertaining the Masons]]
Over the next several years, Petunia still grudgingly permitted Harry to remain in her home over the summers, recharging the blood protections that kept him and her family safe from Voldemort throughout the rest of the year. However, almost everything seemed to go wrong every time she and her husband had guests over when Harry was present. In [[1992]], Vernon invited [[Mason|Mr]] and [[Mason's wife|Mrs Mason]] over for dinner to try and secure a highly lucrative deal with Mr Mason about a stock of drills, which would hopefully massively boost the family's wealth and allow them to purchase a holiday home abroad.

[[File:Cake to be dropped on head.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Petunia watches as a pudding cake is dropped on Mrs Mason's head]]
She and Vernon completely forgot it also happened to be Harry's Birthday that day. During the day, she prepared a [[Petunia Dursley's pudding|pudding]] for the Masons and spent most of the day cleaning the house. When Dudley claimed Harry tried to cast a spell on him that day, she punished Harry by giving him more housework. She and Vernon forced Harry to stay in his room and pretended he did not exist. Due to the unexpected appearance of [[Dobby]], the deal was completely ruined following Dobby's destruction of her prized pudding and the arrival of a Ministry Owl terrifying the ornithophobic Mrs Mason, causing the couple to leave their house in horror and disgust.

The [[British Ministry of Magic]] threatened to expel Harry, thinking he had done the magic himself. The Dursleys were also informed that Harry was forbidden to use magic outside of Hogwarts. Vernon then decided to have Harry locked in his bedroom, and she gave Harry cans of cold soup to eat through a cat flap in his bedroom door. Upon Harry's rescue from Privet Drive from [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], [[George Weasley|George]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] using their [[Arthur Weasley|father]]'s [[Flying Ford Anglia]], she, Vernon and Dudley tried to physically pull Harry back into his room from his window to stop him, but they all were left dangling out of the window when the Weasley's drove off and took Harry with them.

====Marge's visit====
[[File:Harry-potter4-petunia.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Petunia is present when Marge is blown up by an enraged [[Harry Potter|Harry]]]]
Then in [[1993]], her sister-in-law [[Marjorie Dursley|Marge]] visited. When Marge cruelly insulted Harry's parents, Harry accidentally lost control of his magic, which caused him to [[Inflating Charm|blow her up like a balloon]]. Vernon insisted Harry return her to how she was, but was refused when Harry informed him that she deserved what she got for her nastiness. The [[Accidental Magic Reversal Squad]] later fixed her and [[Memory Charm|modified her memory]], ensuring that she remembered nothing of her negative experience with magic.

In 1994, Petunia, along with her husband, decided to put Dudley on diet, following his dismal [[Report card|school report]] from Smeltings, which specifically stated he was too overweight to fit into their uniform. She and Vernon were also shocked with Dudley's very poor academic performance, along with complaints of bullying other students. When it was not going so well, she was forced to cut his food down to less than half of what he would usually eat. In order to boost Dudley's self-esteem, she also heavily restricted the diets of the whole household to strictly healthy meals and banned all unhealthy foods; she was also unaware that Harry was secretly eating wizarding sweets in his bedroom gifted to him by his friends. 

[[File:B4C4M1 Weasleys bursting through 4 Privet Drive fireplace.png|250px|thumb|left|The Weasley family arrive in order to retrieve Harry for the World Cup]]
When [[Molly Weasley]] sent an invitation to the family inviting Harry to attend the [[Quidditch World Cup]], Vernon angrily asked his nephew about the very strange letter. After Harry explained, he yelled at him, but eventually said that his nephew could go. Petunia and Vernon were both very displeased with the fact that wizards would be soon visiting their home and claimed she would show them no hospitality when they should arrive. 

When the Weasleys came to pick up Harry by the [[Floo Network]], she became frightened and did not know how to react when in the presence of wizards, especially after when they accidentally destroyed her living room by blowing up their [[electric fire]]place when attempting to travel with [[Floo Powder]]. When the Weasleys were leaving, her son ate a [[Ton-Tongue Toffee]] deliberately left on the floor by [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], causing his tongue to swell wildly; Petunia became hysterical at the sight of her son in such pain, resulting in [[Arthur Weasley]] fixing Dudley's tongue and repairing their living room.

====Dementor attack====
{{Dialogue|Vernon Dursley|And what the ruddy hell are Dementors?|Petunia|They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban.|Petunia speaks of her knowledge of the [[wizarding world]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
During the summer of [[1995]], Petunia and Vernon were suspicious of how Harry would constantly listen to the news, as they were ignorant of how Voldemort had [[Return of Lord Voldemort|returned]] and that Harry was listening to see if Voldemort would launch attacks upon the Muggle world. She and Vernon were also totally ignorant of their son's Dudley's anti-social behaviour with his gang in the neighbourhood, incorrectly believing he was having dinner with his friend's families instead.

[[File:Dudly demented.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Petunia with her husband and son after Dudley was attacked by [[Dementor]]s]]
That summer, Dudley and Harry were [[Attack in Little Whinging|attacked]] by [[Dementor]]s and were only saved by Harry performing [[underage magic]]. She unintentionally revealed some knowledge of the wizarding world by telling Vernon what Dementors were. When asked how she knew, she said that she heard "[[Severus Snape|that awful boy]]" and Lily talking about them (although Harry assumed at the time that she was referring to his father, due to his ignorance of Snape's childhood friendship with his mother).

When Vernon ordered Harry out of the house, she reluctantly stepped in after a [[Albus Dumbledore's howler to Petunia Dursley|howler]] (later revealed to have been from Dumbledore) arrived telling Petunia to "''remember [[Albus Dumbledore|my]] last''."

When Harry Potter finished his [[1995–1996 school year|fifth year of schooling]] in [[June]] [[1996]], Petunia, Vernon and Dudley reluctantly came to [[King's Cross Station]] to pick him up. However, they were greeted by members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], who ordered them to start treating Harry reasonably at home, especially after [[Alastor Moody]] frightened them with his [[Alastor Moody's magical eye|magical eye]]. They told the Dursleys that if not, Harry would write to them and that they would pay them a visit; this threat worked well, scaring Petunia and Vernon into treating Harry decently for a change.

====Visit from Albus Dumbledore====
[[File:Hbp.c03-will-and-wont.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Albus Dumbledore visits the Dursleys]]
In the summer of [[1996]], the Dursleys were visited by [[Albus Dumbledore]] at their house, who came to inform them and Harry of [[Sirius Black]]'s [[Sirius Black's will|will]], in wake of his godfather's death. Petunia was shocked with the sudden arrival of Dumbledore, who complimented her flourishing [[agapanthus]] in the garden. When she and her family refused to drink Dumbledore's levitating drinks out of fear, the drinks simply emptied their contents over their heads. 

She and her husband were very surprised to be informed that Harry had inherited [[12 Grimmauld Place]] and were terrified when the [[House-elf]] [[Kreacher]] [[Apparition|apparated]] into their living room suddenly but briefly. Dumbledore also admonished Vernon and Petunia for abusing Harry growing up and for how their spoiling of Dudley had emotionally damaged their child irrevocably. Dumbledore took Harry with him afterwards and Harry stayed the remainder of the summer at [[The Burrow]] with the [[Weasley family|Weasley]]s.

====Hiding from Death Eaters====
{{Quote|She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him: she gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech|Petunia fighting to say goodbye and good luck to Harry|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
In the summer of 1997, the blood protection on Harry was due to expire. Petunia, Dudley and Vernon were placed under the protection of [[Dedalus Diggle]] and [[Hestia Jones]], both members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]].

[[File:Petunia saying goodbye.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Petunia saying goodbye to her home and to [[Harry Potter|Harry]]]]
Just before the group left Privet Drive, Petunia watched her son offer the first words of acceptance Harry had ever heard from a Dursley and she burst into tears on Dudley. Petunia walked towards the door to leave, looked back at Harry and opened her mouth to speak, but shortly after she pursed them back up and walked out. 

Petunia had wanted to wish Harry luck with his quest, but suppressed it and left [[Privet Drive]] with her family. They went into hiding from [[Death Eaters]] and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], who probably would have tried to [[Cruciatus Curse|torture]] them into giving away Harry's whereabouts and would have most likely killed them regardless.

===Later life===
In later life, her only son Dudley married and had at least two [[Dudley Dursley's children|children]], making her a grandmother and mother-in-law to [[Dudley Dursley's wife|Dudley's wife]]. Harry has said to have been on "Christmas card" terms with Dudley and his family and went to visit them occasionally, which his children hated.

At some point before 2020, Petunia passed away for unknown reasons. It was revealed that she kept the [[Harry Potter's blanket|blanket]] that Harry was brought to her in when he was a baby, which was given back to him after her death.

==Physical appearance==
Petunia was a thin, blonde-haired woman with "''nearly twice the usual amount of neck''." Several times she is called "horse-faced" or "horsy," Fittingly, she is also said to have "[[horse]]-like teeth."   

She had "large, pale" eyes, the colour of which were unknown. It is unlikely that she shared her sister's bright green eyes, since they are very notable and the oft-made comparison between Lily and Harry's eyes was never made between Petunia and her sister or Harry. It is possible that, like her [[Dudley Dursley|son]], she had blue eyes.  

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|That's where you're going! A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy... weirdos, that's what you two are. It's good that you're being separated from normal people. It's for our safety.|Petunia confronts her sister before leaving the train station|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Petunia was a nosy, hostile and repressed woman who, like her husband, was fanatically obsessed with "appearing normal". Petunia hated and was very much afraid of magic, and, indeed, anything out of the ordinary. She blindly doted on her son Dudley, but shunned [[Harry Potter|Harry]] throughout his entire childhood because of his "[[Magic|peculiarities]]". In her spare time, Petunia often spied on her neighbours, and enjoyed gossiping about their often sordid secrets to her husband, and possibly her friends.

Much like the rest of the [[Dursley family]], she was a spiteful bully, who took pleasure in abusing her nephew Harry, stemming from her resentment towards her sister Lily, Harry's mother. She cruelly mistreated and neglected Harry throughout most of his childhood, often calling him a "freak" and never showed any compassion towards him, whilst constantly spoiling and praising her son Dudley. Petunia was shown to be unpleasant and contemptuous even as a child, as she frequently insulted her sister as a "freak" due to her magical abilities and her sneering towards a young Severus Snape due to his shabby clothes and lower-class background.   

[[File:PetuniaDursley.jpg|231x231px|thumb|left|A neat and tidy Petunia in her overly decorated living room]]

Petunia was very house proud and was obsessed with keeping it clean, as she constantly kept her home clean and tidy, even to the point of cleaning the kitchen worktop surfaces before bed. She also hated animals, as for example, she was disgusted at the sight of [[Marjorie Dursley|Marge Dursley]]'s [[bulldog]] [[Ripper]] slobbering over her clean kitchen floor. She also appeared to be afraid of [[owl]]s, as she became terrified when a large number of them came to deliver Harry his [[Hogwarts acceptance letter]].

Petunia was responsible for Dudley's anti-social personality, along with her husband, due to their spoiling of him. She was also unable to realise her son Dudley's complete lack of positive qualities, and believed him to be a gifted and clever boy who was misunderstood by his teachers (whilst ironically shunning Harry), despite the fact he received abysmal school results. She was also very gullible to believe Dudley went to a different friend's house for dinner each night as a teenager, when in reality he and his gang were causing trouble in the neighbourhood and bullying younger children. Of course, her doting love for Dudley may have caused her to be in outright denial of his antisocial behaviours, although on one occasion, she did threaten to cut his pocket money should he not stick to his diet, showing she was somewhat capable of disciplining her son should she wanted to. 

[[File:Aunt Petunia looking shocked.JPG|251x251px|thumb|Petunia shocked to see numerous owls delivering Hogwarts acceptance letters for Harry]] 

At the heart of Petunia's character was her secret regret at having not been born a witch like her sister. As a child, Petunia was both frightened of and envious of her sister's astonishing abilities. She also heavily felt that her parent's favoured Lily over her, resulting in feelings of being ignored and unappreciated by them. When Lily was accepted into Hogwarts, Petunia wrote a letter to Professor Dumbledore begging him to take her as well. He rejected her kindly, but when Lily discovered the exchange, Petunia only said that she "''didn't want to go to that 'freak' school anyway''", when in reality she was very upset at realising she had no magical abilities herself. In addition, Petunia was understandably devastated upon learning of her sister's death, and had deep feelings of sadness inside her for never reconciling with her before she died.

Petunia frequently referred to witches and wizards as "freaks". However, deep down never did she forget that Harry was her sister's son. She begrudgingly gave him room and board for sixteen years because she knew that her home was the only place that he could be safe from the hands of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. Although she did feel have feeling for her nephew deep down, she was too repressed inside to ever express such emotions and was unable to say anything to him before they all departed from 4 Privet Drive in 1997, showing she was never able to let go of her resentment.

Due to having grown up with wizards, Petunia had a somewhat greater familiarity with magic than Vernon. For example, she surprised her family by revealing that she had known about [[Azkaban]] from overhearing discussions between [[Lily J. Potter|her sister]] and "[[Severus Snape|that awful boy]]". However, her knowledge was very limited, since Petunia was unfamiliar with many magical subjects such as [[Quidditch]] and [[Transfiguration]]. Another example of her crude and ignorant comprehension of the wizarding world was her belief that her deplorable mistreatment of her nephew could suppress any "[[Magic|abnormality]]" in his system, while in fact [[Magic genes|magic was innate and inherited]].

==Relationships==

===Family===
====Evans family====
{{Quote|I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!|Petunia's feelings regarding Lily|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

[[File:Lily Potter1.jpg|240x240px|thumb|left|[[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]], her younger sister]]

It is unknown what kind of relationship Petunia has with her parents, though she seems resentful of them for keeping Lily and her special talents in high regard. Petunia may have felt left out or lesser in comparison to her sister (this may have contributed even more to her intense dislike of magic). It is known that they had died by the time Petunia had a son.

Lily Evans was Petunia's only sibling. When Lily's magical abilities began to manifest themselves, Petunia was torn between curiosity and disapproval. Their relationship became even more strained when Lily became friends with [[Severus Snape]], the very peculiar boy next door.

When Lily was admitted to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Petunia secretly wrote to [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] begging him to let her attend as well. After being kindly rejected by him, Petunia began calling wizards and witches "weirdos" and denied the existence of her sister as much as possible. She would not admit it, but deep inside her, Petunia still cared for Lily, sending her sister a vase (however horrible in Lily's opinion) one [[Christmas]] and was in all probability devastated when her sister was murdered.  

As James didn't have any living relatives, it was possibly Petunia who arranged the funeral for her sister and brother-in-law and had them buried in [[Godric's Hollow]].

After being given Harry, Petunia kept Lily's blanket, in which he was wrapped, for the rest of her life as (aside from Harry) it was all of her sister she had left.

====Vernon Dursley====
[[File:Vernon Dursley.jpg|245x245px|thumb|[[Vernon Dursley]], her husband]]
Petunia met Vernon Dursley at work and married him sometime later. She identified with his narrow-minded views and was proud of his position at work. She and Vernon ignored [[Harry Potter|Harry]] as much as possible and excluded him from most of the family activities.

They were extremely vain, materialistic, and preoccupied with status. They gave [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] everything he wanted, allowing him to rule the house. Conversely, they kept strict control over Harry; he performed the chores, cooked the meals (or at least breakfast), and spent time otherwise locked in the cupboard under the stairs. After Harry re-entered the wizarding world, Petunia and Vernon's control over him diminished.

It is unknown if Vernon knew that his wife wanted to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] herself in the past, about her previously close relationship with Lily, or her childhood with the wizard [[Severus Snape]]. Given the fact that Petunia had always wanted to appear 'normal', it is likely that she did not tell him. 

====Dudley Dursley====
{{Quote|The best that can be said is that Harry has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.|Professor Dumbledore admonishes Petunia's parenting skills|Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince}}

[[File:Dudley DH.png|thumb|left|[[Dudley Dursley]], her son and only child]]

Dudley was Petunia's first and only child. To say that Dudley was pampered and spoiled is an understatement. Petunia and her husband catered to Dudley's every whim and lavished affection on him while completely disregarding [[Harry Potter|Harry]]. They praised Dudley excessively, despite the fact that he rarely worked hard or achieved anything noteworthy (except perhaps his considerable boxing abilities, but even that was essentially an extension of his aggressive, bullying nature). Petunia never acknowledged when her son was in the wrong and overlooked his many flaws. As a result of her indulging Dudley's gluttony, he grew up extremely obese. However, Petunia, was in complete denial about her son's size and said that it was just "baby fat".

Petunia was a poor parent because she cared more about indulging her son than teaching him how to be a good person and as a consequence, he grew up to be lazy, selfish and with no moral values. This fact came back to haunt Dudley when he encountered the [[dementor]]s.

====Harry Potter====

[[File:Harry Potter.jpg|233x233px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], her nephew]]

Petunia never showed any [[love]] and affection at all towards Harry because he reminded her of [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]] and the wizarding world. She treated him as a waste of space, often abusing him, giving him the cupboard under the stairs at first and making him do all the chores. She, along with [[Vernon Dursley|Vernon]], ignored most of Harry's birthdays.

She didn't accept Harry as a second son and never gave him the love and affection he needed and craved from her. She kept him entirely ignorant of the wizarding world and tried to make her family look as normal as possible, as part of her attempts to hide Harry from other people. When Harry left to search for [[Horcrux]]es in 1997, Petunia was almost able to bring herself to wish him luck and admit that her poor treatment of him was born out of jealousy, but backed out at the last moment and left without saying a word.

During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Harry was privy to many [[Memory|memories]] of [[Severus Snape]], after the latter's death at the fangs of [[Nagini]], regarding his (Snape's) origins and loyalties. Many of the first memories that Harry had gazed upon depicted his future Aunt Petunia and unwittingly explained to him the reasons for her hatred of him and magic overall, such as: her falling out with his mother as children, Petunia's jealousy of Lily's [[magic]]al abilities and her childhood enmity with Snape. However, Harry was more concerned about discovering Snape's loyalties and origins than he was about decrypting Petunia's hatred for him.

Petunia would later become an aunt-in-law to Harry's wife [[Ginevra Weasley]] and a great-aunt to Harry and Ginny's three children; [[James Potter II|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna]]. Although Harry's relationship with Dudley had mended to the point that they remained on "Christmas card terms" and visited occasionally, it is unknown if Petunia herself ever had contact with Harry again. In spite of everything, Harry cared for her enough to push them to go into hiding for their protection. Although it is not known if Petunia contacted Harry again after the war, it is highly possible that Petunia reconciled with her nephew and was on Christmas cards terms with him too. Given how Harry learned of what caused the rift between his mother and her sister, Harry gained a new understanding of his aunt. After her death, Dudley gave Harry his blanket which had been kept in the possession of Petunia since his arrival at Privet Drive.

===Severus Snape===
{{Dialogue a-b|Petunia Dursley|'I heard ... that ''awful boy''.. telling ''her'' about them years ago.|Harry Potter|If you mean my mum and [[James Potter I|dad]], why don't your use their names?|[[Harry Potter|Harry]] and Petunia discussing Snape after Dudley Dursley was attacked by dementors|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}} 
[[File:Severus Snape Profile.jpg|247x247px|thumb|left|[[Severus Snape]], her childhood neighbour]]
Petunia first met Severus Snape during their childhood. She was the sister of [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], but Petunia was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]], unlike her sister. Snape and Petunia strongly disliked each other, from the first moment they met. Petunia, who was contemptuous of anything out of the ordinary, viewed him with disdain because of his poor economic status and because he was such an oddball. Snape, on the other hand, regarded her balefully because she was a Muggle and also because she made disparaging comments about his clothes. Possibly as a result of this childhood animosity, the subject of Snape, as with anything magic-related, was never mentioned under the [[4 Privet Drive|Dursley's roof]] until [[Dudley Dursley]] got attacked by dementors and he was indirectly mentioned by Petunia as "''that awful boy" ''when talking about Dementors.

In an ironic twist, Snape and Petunia's negative encounters helped shape their respective adult personalities. Snape's interactions with Petunia likely helped reinforce his already growing disdain for the Muggle world, which caused him to dabble in [[Pure-blood supremacy]] and the [[Dark Arts]] during his teenage years and early adulthood. Likewise, Petunia's encounters with Snape likely hardened her heart towards anything and anyone related to the wizarding world. In a cruel sense of irony, Snape's interests in the Dark Arts indirectly caused the death of Petunia's sister Lily. 

===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Quote| ''REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA''.|Dumbledore's howler to Petunia after the Dementor attack|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|237x237px|thumb|[[Albus Dumbledore]]]]

It can be assumed that Aunt Petunia would not have gotten on well with Albus Dumbledore due to his "unDursleyness" and due the fact that he was as unusual as it is possible to be. It was also he who alerted Petunia to the death of [[Lily J. Potter|her sister]] and abandoned [[Harry Potter]] on her doorstep shortly after, ignoring her feelings on the matter. After [[Vernon Dursley]] tried to throw Harry out after the attack on [[Dudley Dursley]], Dumbledore sent Petunia an exploding, screaming letter ([[howler]]).  

Not even a year later Dumbledore arrived at [[4 Privet Drive]] uninvited telling them that they had to let Harry stay until his 17th birthday for their protection, giving them drinks that constantly hit them in the head. However, when Dumbledore reprehended the Dursleys for their cruel treatment of Harry, Petunia, instead of reacting with anger like her husband, was thought by Harry to look faintly embarrassed. It is unknown to how Petunia reacted to his death or if Harry, [[Arthur Weasley]] or [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] told her about his murder. Despite the kindness shown by Dumbledore to Petunia in his letter denying her a place at Hogwarts, she likely felt a sense of bitterness towards him for a number of years. 

==Etymology==
Petunia is the name of a flower. Her younger sister, Lily, also bears the name of a flower. This could have been done accidentally or by means of demonstrating Petunia's and Lily's sisterhood. A petunia is also a flower that is a symbol of resentment and anger. Petunia was a name J.K. Rowling used for unpleasant female characters in games in her youth, and believes the name may have subconsciously came from ''{{wplink|Joe and Petunia}}'', a series of public information films she would have seen in her youth.

Petunia flowers themselves are used to represent resentment, along with anger. The alternative meaning is wanting the comfort of another person, which is lightly implied when she asks to attend Hogwarts with her sister. It should also be noted that the flower is known for not smelling particularly pleasant.

Petunia's maiden name was Evans. ''Evans'' is a Welsh or English surname derived from the given name ''Evan''. As a Welsh name, [[Wikipedia:Evan|Evan]] means "young warrior". It can also be considered a form of the name ''John'', meaning "God is gracious".

Petunia's married surname is Dursley. [[Wikipedia:Dursley|Dursley]] is a town in Gloucestershire, England. [[J. K. Rowling]] has commented that she visited the place as a child and hated it, which likely affected her choice of surname for the awful family, remarking "I don't imagine I'm very popular in Dursley". The town is known for its Victorian history in coal mining. Rowling chose the name because it sounded "dull and forbidding".

==Behind the scenes==

*The role of Petunia is played by [[Fiona Shaw]] in the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', as well as ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]''.
**[[Ariella Paradise]] portrays a young Petunia Evans in {{DH|F2}}.
*Her appearance in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]] is somewhat different than the [[Harry Potter (book series)|books]], where she is described as being ''"blonde and horse-toothed."'' In the films, however, she has dark brown hair and normal teeth.
*In a deleted scene in {{DH|F1}}, Petunia is seen looking very solemn, standing in the middle of the empty living room at [[Privet Drive]]. Harry walks down the stairs and stops when he sees her. She says that she has lived in this house for twenty years, and now she's expected to leave in one night. Harry explains how [[Death Eaters|they]] will torture her, and stop at nothing. Petunia replies that she knows what they are capable of, that night at [[Godric's Hollow]], Harry didn't just lose a mother, Petunia lost a [[Lily J. Potter|sister]]. After which, she hurries out the door. This is very likely what Petunia was going to say in the book, but chose not to.
*Petunia was the first female character to be introduced in the series, though in the films it is [[Minerva McGonagall]].
*Since Petunia's sister, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]], was a Muggle-born witch, both girls must have a wizarding ancestry, however distantly. This means that Petunia was still related to wizards, even if she pretended she did not have a sister.
*Rowling has said that Petunia's name may have come from a character in a public information film that she saw when she was a child.
*As a child, Petunia went with Lily to Platform 9 ¾ when Lily left for Hogwarts. However, in {{PS}}, when Harry asks her and Vernon about Platform 9 ¾, she apparently has no idea where it is or how to find it. Either she forgot where it was, or more likely she pretended not to know anything about it to antagonise Harry.
*Coincidentally, there is a character from ''Marvel Comics ''by the name of "Aunt Petunia", and she is the aunt of the Fantastic Four member The Thing. Unlike Petunia Dursley however, this character does not appear to be abusive or disdainful of her nephew, as the Thing often proudly describes himself as "Aunt Petunia's favourite nephew".
