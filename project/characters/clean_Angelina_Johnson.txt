'''Angelina Weasley''' (née''' Johnson''') (b. [[24 October|24]] – [[30 October]] [[1977]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and a [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She was also a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]]. She was also the captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] in her seventh year, which was also [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s fifth year.

In [[1998]], two years after she had left school, she returned and fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters|followers]]. Sometime after the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], she [[Marriage|married]] [[George Weasley]], and the couple had two children, [[Fred Weasley II|Fred II]] and [[Roxanne Weasley]].



Angelina was born in late [[October]] [[1977]] on or in between the [[24 October|24th]] and [[30 October|30th]]. When she was eleven, Angelina was accepted into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and visited [[Diagon Alley]] to purchase the required equipment for school, including her wand.


Early years


Angelina began attending Hogwarts in 1989, when she was nearly twelve years old, and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. She became a [[Chaser]] on the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] by or before her third year. Angelina was a popular student, and friends with fellow Gryffindors Alicia Spinnet, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], Katie Bell, and [[Lee Jordan]]; the latter appeared to be attracted to Angelina, making various admiring comments about her when he commentated on [[Quidditch]] games.

Angelina did not like the way that [[Oliver Wood]] referred to his players as "men" or "lads", as she, along with Katie Bell and Alicia Spinnet were female players and she would often have to correct him whilst he gave motivational speeches before games in the locker rooms. In 1991, the famous [[Harry Potter]] would arrive at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and after Professor McGonagall witnessed his flying skills, she appointed him [[Seeker]] for the team and Angelina would play alongside him in his first game. During an early Quidditch match, [[Severus Snape]] officiated instead of [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] and he called a penalty against Angelina during a [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team|Hufflepuff]]-Gryffindor game.


When playing against [[Slytherin]], Angelina seemed to be an open target for a group take-out: she was boxed in by two players and knocked off her broom during one game. In 1992, Hogwarts was under threat of closure as the [[Chamber of Secrets]] had been declared open once again and [[Muggle-born]] students were being attacked. As a precaution against this, a Duelling Club was organised and Angelina attended the first gathering with her friends Katie Bell and [[Alicia Spinnet]], and the three fought over Professor [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s cloak when he slung it into the audience.


In her fifth year, Captain Oliver Wood would put a lot of pressure on the team as this was his final year in education and he wanted to win the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] for Gryffindor. Angelina and Katie discussed Hufflepuff player [[Cedric Diggory]]'s physical appearance before a game and the two both expressed interest. Angelina commented that he was tall and good-looking and Katie stating he was "''strong and silent''". Gryffindor later won the Quidditch cup that year.

Sixth year

 arrive]]
In [[1994]], Hogwarts was the holding grounds to the [[Triwizard Tournament]], a tournament required to test the bravery and skills of a wizard that was thought to be too dangerous for wizards under a certain age. Angelina was among the many students who entered their names to the [[Goblet of Fire]], as she was just of age the previous week, but she was not selected as a champion. Her friends, Fred and George also entered, but under the influence of an [[Ageing Potion]] because they were still underage, which backfired on them. Due to the Tournament taking place, all [[Quidditch]] games and practise had been cancelled, and despite [[Oliver Wood]] leaving the previous year, Angelina would not yet take on the position of Captain of the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] as it was not required to be filled.

]]
Throughout the Tournament Angelina was a supporter of champion [[Harry Potter]]. She was seen cheering loudly with Fred and George during the first task, in which Harry used his flying skills to avoid the Dragon and get the egg. Also in that same year as a requirement of the Triwizard Tournament traditions Hogwarts would hold a [[Yule Ball]]. Angelina was asked to the Yule Ball by Fred Weasley, which she accepted.

In the final task, champions were required to enter a maze and fight their way to the [[Triwizard Cup]] to win the tournament. Harry Potter and [[Cedric Diggory]] both reached this cup, but it had been turned into a [[Portkey]] which transported both of them to the graveyard at [[Little Hangleton]]. Cedric was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on Voldemort's orders, while Harry's blood was used to revive the Dark Lord. Harry later returned Cedric's body back to the school grounds and Angelina was amongst the first to notice that all was not well and her short-lived cheers turned to loud screams. At the end of the school year Angelina attended the [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory]] that [[Albus Dumbledore]] held and she appeared quite emotional, after all Cedric was in her year, he was popular and a fan of Quidditch like herself. During this memorial service, Albus Dumbledore told the students, against the wishes of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], exactly how Diggory had died and confirmed that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned to power.

Seventh year


In September [[1995–1996 school year|1995]], [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] appointed Angelina [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Quidditch captain,]] which came with a badge, use of an office at the Quidditch Pitch, access to the [[Prefects' Bathroom]] and authority to determine the composition of the team (excepting those undergoing punishments). She proved to be at least as demanding of her team as [[Oliver Wood]] had been. She attributed this hard-driving attitude to the stress of the job, saying that she regretted having been so hard on Wood when he was Quidditch captain. Angelina had difficulty finding talent and was plagued with a year of practises most of them ending in shambles.

Her first duty as Quidditch captain was managing tryouts on the first Friday of term to fill Oliver Wood's keeper position. Upon learning Harry had to serve detention that day, Angelina was angry at him, deciding that it was his fault, and ordered him to say whatever he had to say to get out of detention and be there for tryouts, something he failed to do. After she had gone, Harry commented that they should check with [[Puddlemere United]] and see if Oliver Wood was still alive, as Angelina seemed to be channelling his spirit.

Finding that Harry was not able to convince Umbridge to change his Friday detention, Angelina angrily suggested that people who wanted to stay on the team would find a way to make it to practises. Friday evening, after the try-outs, Angelina apologised to Harry for her earlier curtness, and said that she may have been too hard on Wood; she found managing the team to be a bit stressful. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] had not been the best [[Keeper]] she tried out; there were two better players, one was not willing to commit the time to practise and the other was a bit of a whiner, and Angelina hoped that Ron, being from a family with excellent [[Quidditch]] players, would develop over time. She likely had already decided to keep returning members on the team as she previously called them "Keeper tryouts," stated she wanted to see how candidates fitted in with the team, and didn't require Harry to try out.  Their first practise as a team was marred with jeers and catcalls by Slytherins, including an insult to Angelina's braided hair. 

They drilled by passing the [[Quaffle]]. Ron missed it twice, but after catching it passed it so hard to Katie it hit her face and caused a nosebleed. Fred gave her a purple sweet. They released the other balls and took to flying until Angelina blew the whistle to stop, then criticised Ron for wandering off, letting in goals and told him to either stay in centre position or circle the goals.  Katie's nose was still bleeding, and three minutes later Angelina stopped and ended practise; saying Katie needed the hospital wing. Fred realised he gave her a Blood Blisterpod by mistake and, with George, flew her to the castle.

When Harry got a week's worth of detentions from Professor Umbridge, causing him to miss one or more practises, Angelina was furious, shouting at him in the [[Great Hall]].  This caused Professor McGonagall to leave her table and take 5 points from Gryffindor, then another 5 points for Harry getting detention, which he thought unfair. She then threatened that if Angelina didn't confine her shouting to the Quidditch pitch, she might lose the team Captaincy.


During a [[Hogsmeade weekend trips|Hogsmeade Weekend trip]], Angelina, all her Quidditch teammates and others including Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs met at the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] to learn about a secret study group Harry was forming to learn [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] because [[Dolores Umbridge]] wouldn't allow spells to be cast in her class. Angelina was the first to say meetings shouldn't clash with Quidditch practice and again when they were considering a place and time to meet next.  She and all attendees at the table drank butterbeer and signed [[Dumbledore's Army parchment jinx|Hermione's contract]] agreeing not to tell Umbridge ''—'' or anybody else ''—'' what they were up to.  Due to the spy, [[Willy Widdershins]] overhearing them at the pub, on Monday Umbridge implemented [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four|Educational Decree Number 24]] to disband all groups, teams and meetings of three or more students, unless approved by her, under penalty of expulsion.   

Upon reading the sign, Angelina immediately realised Quidditch was included and on the verge of tears implored Harry to keep his temper with Umbridge in order to get permission to re-form the team. Harry agreed and did so when she was inspecting his Potions class and again in Umbridge's own class. Nevertheless, upon asking Umbridge, she replied she needed time to consider, despite that morning approving the Slytherin team, which meant Gryffindors couldn't practise Quidditch that night. Angelina had intended to teach them the [[Sloth Grip Roll]]. The next day, Angelina told Ron and Harry during break that she got permission to reform the Gryffindor Quidditch team after she went to McGonagall who appealed to Dumbledore who insisted Umbridge allow them to play. 


Harry did attend that night's practise in the rain, which Angelina said might be the conditions of their first match, though Fred and George wanted to skive off due to the rain and boils from testing a [[Skiving Snackbox]]. She insisted they all perform the ''[[Impervius Charm|Impervius]]'' charm to keep the rain off their faces, referring to a previous match with Hufflepuff, when Harry used it to keep his glasses from fogging. After an hour of low visibility, Angelina blew the whistle and ended the practise. The day of the next practise Angelina decided to cancel it because of more pouring rain. 

She was taken aback when informing Harry, who said he was having his first Defence Against the Dark Arts study meeting that night, and to spread the word to Katie and Alicia. That night she followed Harry's instruction to a door on the 7th floor opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy and entered the [[Room of Requirement]]. As a group they decided Harry was leader, the group's name would be called [[Dumbledore's Army]], or the D.A. for short then Harry taught them ''[[Disarming Charm|Expeliarmus]].'' In later sessions Harry taught them the [[Impediment Jinx]] and [[Reductor Curse]]. [[Hermione Granger]] then gave Angelina and the other members [[Dumbledore's Army coin|fake Galleon]]<nowiki/>s with a [[Protean Charm]] to communicate timing of the next meeting.

The Gryffindor-[[Slytherin Quidditch team|Slytherin]] rivalry was particularly intense leading up to their first match. Slytherins' normal taunts affected Ron more than the others, being new. Their Head of House, [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape,]] booked the pitch so often Gryffindor's had trouble practising. He also ignored Slytherins' attempts to hex Gryffindor players even when Alicia Spinnet was hospitalised. Meanwhile, McGonagall didn't give Transfiguration homework to Gryffindors the week of the match, saying "''I've been accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study... use the extra time to practice.''"


Before the match Slytherins were seen wearing "[[Weasley is Our King badge|WEASLEY IS OUR KING]]" badges. In the locker room, Angelina notified the team that she didn't know much about Slytherin's new beaters, Crabbe and Goyle, to which Harry and Ron said, "We do." She said they were the usual gorillas unlikely to fly very well. As they left the locker room they heard Slytherins singing for the first time "[[Weasley is Our King]]" having derogatory lyrics to unnerve Ron. When shaking hands with Slytherin captain, Montague, she didn't wince as he tried to crush her hand.  During the match she saw that Harry was stationary in midair watching Ron and the match and had to shout at him to get going. After Slytherin scored 4 goals, Angelina scored Gryffindor's first and only goal and heard the sound of Luna Lovegood's [[Luna Lovegood's lion-topped hat|lion]] hat roar. She then witnessed Crabbe hit a [[Bludger]] in Harry's back after he caught the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]], knocking him off his broom six feet from the ground.  She landed nearby, asking frantically if he was alright, then after he said he was, informing him who hit him. Ron, shamed by letting in goals, left the pitch.  

When [[Draco Malfoy]] landed and started taunting the Weasley twins, she grabbed Fred's arm and told him to leave it. She, Alicia and Katie then held back Fred, while Harry held back George until Harry lost his temper and they attacked Draco on the pitch with their fists, two-on-one, until stopped by [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]].  In McGonagall's office, using [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Five]], Professor Umbridge gave Fred, George, and Harry a lifetime ban from [[Quidditch]] for fighting and confiscated their brooms, though Fred didn't fight. (The ban was lifted after Dolores Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts). In the [[Gryffindor Common Room|Common Room]], when Angelina heard this, she spoke in a hollow voice, "''What are we going to do''?" Instead of celebrating, Gryffindor's spent the night downcast, while the Snitch Harry captured zoomed around the room, enticing [[Crookshanks]]. 

At the last meeting of Dumbledore's Army before the Christmas holidays, Angelina told Harry that she had finally managed to find new [[Beater]]s and a [[Seeker]] for the Quidditch team. The Seeker was [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who was surprisingly good, though not a match for Harry. It was Alicia who told Harry the names of the new Beaters: [[Andrew Kirke]] and [[Jack Sloper]]. Practises next term continued to be intense and frustrating. Angelina then found it even more challenging not to get angry with the new teammates, as Ron couldn't block goals with people watching. Angelina booked the pitch for a full day of practise on Valentine's Day, preventing her team from leaving for the Hogsmeade Weekend trip.  

The following Monday night's practise nearly put her in tears, while Ron and Ginny left the pitch covered in mud. Fred and George watched, and reported Ron, Sloper and Kirke were so bad they were sure to lose their 2nd match, which happened. During the 22-minute match against [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team|Hufflepuff]], Ron's 14th failed save was dramatically bad, Sloper hit Angelina in the mouth with his beater's bat, Kirke fell off his broom, and Ginny hesitated catching the Snitch for the win, but then caught it for a 10-point loss, two-hundred forty to two-hundred thirty. Afterwards, Angelina refused to accept Ron's resignation from the team. 

D.A. meetings ended when [[Marietta Edgecombe]] reported their next meeting to Professor Umbridge. Harry Potter had just started teaching [[Patronus Charm|Patronuses]] after the [[Shield Charm]].  Dumbledore took responsibility for an illegal student group so they wouldn't receive punishment (including expulsion), fought Ministry officials (including Umbridge) and fled Hogwarts. Fred and George released magical fireworks throughout the school during class time on Umbridge's first day as acting Headmistress. Quidditch practises continued to be frustrating for Angelina and the team. One was cut short early when Ron took Sloper to the [[Hospital Wing]] after getting knocked out (likely with his own bat). After being caught turning a 5th floor corridor into a swamp, Angelina's friends Fred and George Weasley avoided punishment (whipping) by dropping out with a dramatic exit in front of most of the school, inciting [[Peeves]] into tormenting Dolores Umbridge as they left.  

The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw took place on the last weekend in May.  Ravenclaw Captain Davies scored the first goal of the game, to which Slytherins sang "Weasley is Our King." After that, Ron made many more saves, so when Ginny caught the Snitch, the team won the match, and with the tie-breaker won the Quidditch Cup for a second year during her time at Hogwarts. Gryffindors carried Ron on their shoulders back to the castle, and sang "Weasley is Our King" with their own positive lyrics.  

It being her seventh year, Angelina sat for her [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]]. At the end of exams she did not respond to the message on her fake coin signalling a D.A. meeting to help Harry break into Umbridge's office on the mistaken belief he needed to rescue [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. Umbridge was sacked the next day and [[Albus Dumbledore]] was restored as headmaster.


Battle of Hogwarts

During the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]], when Hogwarts had been taken over by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] Angelina maintained contact with [[Dumbledore's Army]] from the outside via the D.A. coin she had been given by [[Hermione Granger]].


When she received the signal that the school was going to make a stand against Voldemort in 1998, she returned to fight against the incoming army of [[Death Eaters]]. Angelina also must have kept in contact with her school friends [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Katie Bell]], and [[Oliver Wood]], as she arrived with the three. Angelina survived the devastating [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. She most likely sat with the rest of the Weasley family grieving over Fred's body, as Fred was a good friend of hers.


Sometime after the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Angelina grew closer to her friend [[George Weasley]]. The two eventually married and went on to have two children together: [[Fred Weasley II]], named after his late uncle who also was Angelina's teenage romance, and [[Roxanne Weasley]].

In the 2010s, Angelina's younger self appeared as a [[Foundable]] in two different instances during the [[Calamity]]. In the first, she was hounded by a pair of rogue [[Bludger]] [[Confoundable]]s, requiring volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] to cast the [[Slowing Charm]] in order to aid her. She also appeared alongside Fred Weasley as they appeared at the Yule Ball, trapped by a snowstorm Confoundable. With the usage of [[Meteolojinx Recanto]], the storm was able to be repelled and the pair could be returned back to 1994.

Angelina left her marital home to care for her ailing father shortly before the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] in July 2014. Nonetheless, Angelina travelled with her husband, son, and daughter to the [[Patagonian Desert]] to attend the final of the Quidditch World Cup on 11 July, where the four put on "''a show of togetherness up in the box''". During the match, commentator [[Rita Skeeter]] mentioned rumours that Angelina had "grown restless" in her marriage to George, and thus chosen to leave her marital home to live elsewhere (presumably with her lover). Her fellow commentator, Angelina's sister-in-law [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]], quickly refuted these rumours, explaining that Angelina had recently been caring for her father.



Angelina was described to be a tall, pretty witch with dark skin, brown eyes and long black hair that was often braided. Angelina was attractive, receiving romantic advances and affection from multiple classmates, such as Lee Jordan and Fred Weasley. Pansy Parkinson mocked Angelina's appearance (among many other Gryffindors), claiming that her braided hairstyle resembled that of [[worm]]s, but given Pansy's nastiness and bias, her evaluation was most certainly untruthful.



Angelina Johnson was very driven to succeed, whether it be at [[Quidditch]] or in trying out for the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Angelina showed diligence and leadership ability as [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Quidditch Captain]] of her team, as well as competitiveness. She was also brave, as shown by her sorting into [[Gryffindor]] and her decision to return to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] alongside old classmates and friends.

Given her friendship and eventual romantic involvement with both Weasley twins, it is likely that Angelina also enjoyed pranks and had a good sense of humour. However, her sense of humour did not compromise her seriousness about Quidditch. Angelina wouldn't hesitate to give her blunt opinion, telling Harry Potter that [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] was not a fabulous Quidditch player. She also became enraged at Harry when he kept getting detentions from Dolores Umbridge, but apologised later.



*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': In her seventh year Angelina became captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. She was also on the team during 1990-1991, which was towards the end of her second year onwards, showing her skill and talent as a [[Quidditch]] player and [[broomstick]] flyer. 

*'''[[Duelling]]''': Angelina was a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] during her seventh year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], where she was taught how to perform [[martial magic]], thanks to Harry Potter's exemplary teaching. She later fought in and survived the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], showing she was a highly skilful duellist, to have survived such a bloody and violent battle.
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Angelina must have passed her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam with a high grade, because she stated in her seventh year that [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] was a much better teacher, meaning that she must have advanced to the [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] class.



Father
It is likely that Angelina has a good relationship with her [[Angelina Johnson's father|father]], as she cared for him when he was sick.

Fred Weasley
, Angelina's late brother-in-law]]
Angelina became friends with both [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Gryffindor]] students in her year who were on the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] with her. The two attended the [[1994]] [[Yule Ball]] together. When Angelina became the team [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] in [[1995]], she was upset with the twins for getting banned from [[Quidditch]], since it hurt the team's chances to be without them. The two fought alongside one another during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

George Weasley
, her future husband and father of her children|left]]
Angelina and [[George Weasley]] were good friends throughout their Hogwarts years. Fred's death devastated them both, and it may have been their shared grief that led to the two becoming closer. Angelina and George eventually married and had two children, [[Roxanne Weasley]] and [[Fred Weasley II]]

Children
After the Second Wizarding War, Angelina married [[George Weasley]] and they had two children; a son, named [[Fred Weasley II]], in honour of George's brother, and a daughter, [[Roxanne Weasley|Roxanne]].

Nieces and nephews
Angelina had also several nieces and nephews through George's siblings: [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]] and [[Louis Weasley|Louis]], [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s children; [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]] and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]], [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] and [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey]]'s children; [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]], Ron and Hermione's children; and [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]], Ginny and Harry's children. It is supposed that Angelina and George had a good relationship with his nieces and nephews, and that they liked them. James also appeared to take after George, because they both enjoyed doing pranks and teasing their siblings.




[[Lee Jordan]] had a crush on Angelina and didn't hesitate to let her know it, often showing his attraction to her in his Quidditch commentaries. He also stated that Angelina had been refusing to go out with him, indicating that she didn't feel the same way. However, Angelina and Lee were both close to the Weasley twins, which probably hints they were friends themselves, although this was never made clear.


, her allies]]
Angelina became a member of Dumbledore's Army in her seventh year. It was an organisation founded and led by [[Harry Potter]] in order to teach [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] to the members since professor [[Dolores Umbridge]] did not. Angelina knew most members of the army, and was friendly with them.

Angelina was also friends with fellow Gryffindors [[Alicia Spinnet]] and [[Katie Bell]]. The three girls were all [[Chaser]]s on the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]], and joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] together in [[1995]]. Angelina was also friendly with, though not very close to, [[Harry Potter]], her team's [[Seeker]] (although she, along with Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell, kissed Harry when he won them a match against [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team|Ravenclaw]]) and [[Lee Jordan]], the Quidditch commentator who repeatedly asked her out, without success. She was friends with mostly everyone on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. She also appeared to be friendly with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], but she was annoyed by his lack of confidence when he was a member of the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] in [[1996]]. She was also a friend of [[Hermione Granger]], another [[Gryffindor]] girl.

She was also good friends with [[Oliver Wood]], the former Captain of the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] before her. Although Oliver was not a member of Dumbledore's Army, as he had left Hogwarts when it was founded, he supported both Dumbledore's Army and the [[Order of the Phoenix]], fighting with them at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

Other members of Dumbledore's Army were [[Dean Thomas]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], [[Padma and Parvati Patil|Parvati and Padma Patil]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Colin and Dennis Creevey]], [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Zacharias Smith]] and [[Marietta Edgecombe]]. Their relationship with Angelina is unknown, though it is possible that most of them were friends of hers.


'''' is a Latin diminutive of the name ''Angela'', which is derived from the Greek άγγελος, ''angelos'', meaning "messenger" or "angel". Johnson means "son of John".



*Angelina is played by [[Danielle Tabor]] in the films ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. In , she is replaced by actress [[Tiana Benjamin]], as she looked physically the same age as the Weasley twins.
*Tiana Benjamin was unable to reprise the role in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' because her role in '''' was at a point of character development and she could not get time out of this role to film for ''[[Harry Potter]]''. However, Benjamin did voice the character for the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]]. This led to confusion among fans as Tiana had said she would return as Angelina (referring to the video game), but people thought she was returning to the movies.
*In the film adaptation of  Angelina and Fred could be seen among the few people in the Yule Ball who remained the longest, still dancing together.
*Danielle Tabor returned to set to play the character again in the  ride at  theme park.
