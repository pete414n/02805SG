'''Doris Crockford''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who greeted [[Harry Potter]] in the [[Leaky Cauldron]] on the way to Harry's first trip into [[Diagon Alley]] on [[31 July]] [[1991]]. She was enthusiastic to see him, and was noted to have shaken Harry's hand many times.

==Etymology==
The name "Doris" is from the ancient Greek name Δωρις (''Doris'') which meant "Dorian woman". The Dorians were a Greek tribe who occupied the Peloponnese starting in the 12th century BC. In Greek mythology Doris was a sea nymph, one of the many children of Oceanus and Tethys. "Doris" was also the name of Herod the Great's first wife. It began to be used as an English name in the 19th century.

*In {{PS|FA}}, Crockford had long, white, straight hair.
**There is a site<!-- what site? --> where it is rumoured that [[J. K. Rowling]] was the actress who portrayed Doris Crockford. This turned out to be false, since Rowling has stated on her website that she has never been in any of the films, she was asked but declined.
**According to the German dubbing site Synchronkartei.de, this role is played by [[Nina Young]], who also played [[Helena Ravenclaw]] in the same film.
*The name of the character may be a homage to an author known as Doris Crockford who, in 1937, published a book about The [[Flying Scotsman]] - a real-life train that departed from [[King's Cross Station]], platform 10. In Doris's story, the train went on a magical adventure.
*[[Felicitas Bauer]], the actress portraying [[Polly Chapman]] in the Hamburg production of {{CC}}, also portrayed Doris Crockford, voicing her when the [[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child cast lists|cast]] of {{CC}} read aloud {{PS|B|5}} together, organised by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] for the [[2021]] [[Harry Potter Book Night]].
