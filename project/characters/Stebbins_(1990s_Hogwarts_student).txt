'''Stebbins''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1990s]].

==Biography==
A member of [[Hufflepuff]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]], he attended the [[Yule Ball]] with [[Fawcett]] of [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]]. They were caught, presumably kissing, in the [[rose]] bushes during the ball by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], and were each docked ten [[House points]].<ref name="GOF23">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In a deleted scene from {{GOF|FA}}, Stebbins and [[Fawcett]] are caught, presumably kissing, in one of the [[Hogwarts Carriages]], which were parked in the [[Viaduct Courtyard|Entrance Courtyard]].<ref>{{GOF|F}}</ref>
*In the [[Great Britain|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], Russian, Hebrew, Polish and Danish editions of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', when Snape catches Fawcett with Stebbins in chapter 23, he says, "Ten points from [[Hufflepuff]], Fawcett! And ten points from [[Ravenclaw]], too, Stebbins!", although Fawcett is referred to as a Ravenclaw by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in chapter 16.<ref name="lexicon">"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/a-z/f.html#Fawcett S. Fawcett]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> The American edition of the novel amends this error, with Snape taking Fawcett's points from Ravenclaw, and Stebbins' from Hufflepuff.<ref name="lexicon" /> In the ''Goblet of Fire'' film, however, Snape makes a similar error where he refers to Fawcett as a Hufflepuff and Stebbins as a Ravenclaw. The only way it couldn't be a mistake is that Snape mentions the consequences of the partner's rule-breakings.
