He began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[September]] [[1995]], when [[Harry Potter|Harry]] was in his [[fifth year]]. As he was first in his year alphabetically, he was the first to be sorted, and was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. He was a small boy with prominent ears, who often looked terrified. He appeared to believe in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'s'' [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|smear campaign against]] [[Harry Potter]], as he looked at him fearfully when Harry tried to smile at him.


"Abercrombie" is a surname of Celtic or [[Gaelic]] origin. It comes from the name of a parish in Fife, [[Scotland]], on the northern shore of the Firth of Forth, whence the possessor took his surname; from ''Aber'', marshy ground, a place where two or more streams meet; and ''cruime'' or ''crombie'', a bend or crook. Aber, in the Celtic and Gaelic, and also in the Cornish British, signifies the confluence of two or more streams, or the mouth of a river, where it flows into the sea; hence it is often applied to marshy ground, generally near the confluence of two rivers. It also signifies, sometimes, a gulf or whirlpool. "Euan" is of Scottish and Gaelic origin, and it means "born of yew" or "youth". It also means "little swift one" in Irish Gaelic.
