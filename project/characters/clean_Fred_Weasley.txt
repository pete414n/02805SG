'''Fred Weasley I''' ([[1 April]] [[1978]] – [[2 May]] [[1998]]) was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], was the fourth son and the middle child, the most daring and dominant among the twins of [[Arthur Weasley]] and [[Molly Weasley]] , younger brother to [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], older twin brother and best friend to [[George Weasley]], and older brother of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]] <small>(née Weasley)</small>. Fred's first few years were marked by the height of the [[First Wizarding War]] and when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] fell for the first time. 

He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1989]] to [[1996]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. Both he and his twin brother were popular students, known for their sense of humour, pranks, inventions and the fact that they were [[Beater]]s for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. In their first year, they joined the [[Circle of Khanna]], an organisation dedicated to avenging [[Rowan Khanna]]'s death and bringing down [[R]]. In their seventh year, they joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]].

A born prankster and inventor, Fred left Hogwarts shortly prior to graduation to become a successful entrepreneur, alongside his twin brother, George, and opened the joke shop [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] at [[93 Diagon Alley]]. Fred was also a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]; he fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] ([[1997]]) and was a commentator for ''[[Potterwatch]]'' during the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]]. 

Fred participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] ([[1998]]), defending the castle's passageways with his twin. While fighting alongside his brother, [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], he was killed in an explosion caused by an unknown Death Eater. His brother George named his son in honour of him.





Fred Weasley, along with his identical twin [[George Weasley|George]], was born on [[1 April]] [[1978]]; April Fool's Day to [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]], which was appropriate as Fred and George were avid pranksters. Fred was born first. He was raised at his family home of [[The Burrow]], near [[Ottery St Catchpole]] in [[Devon]], [[England]]. In addition to his twin brother, Fred had three older brothers, [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], and two younger siblings, Ron and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. [[Weasley family|His family]] was poor, but loving.

Fred and George enjoyed making mischief from a young age, and were quite a handful for their parents. It was not uncommon for explosions to be heard coming from the bedroom the two shared. They also greatly enjoyed teasing their brothers Percy and Ron. At one point, they even used their family's pet [[Weasley family Puffskein|Puffskein]] for [[Bludger]] practice. At the age of five, Fred [[underage magic|transformed]] Ron's [[teddy bear]] into a giant spider, sparking his arachnophobia, after Ron broke his [[toy broomstick]]. Also around that age, he gave Ron an [[Acid Pops|Acid Pop]], which burnt a hole through his tongue. 

When they were seven years old, Fred and George nearly succeeded in getting Ron to make an [[Unbreakable Vow]] until their father found them; he was so angry that George later said <nowiki>'</nowiki>''his ''(Fred's)'' left buttock has never been the same since.''<nowiki>'</nowiki> One [[Christmas]], Fred and George set off a [[Dungbomb]] under the chair of their great-aunt [[Muriel]] during a family dinner. The elderly witch most likely wrote the twins out of her will for this stunt, and stopped attending Christmas celebrations at the Burrow, for which all the Weasley children were thankful, as Muriel was unpleasant and loved to gosspi.



Fred was educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1989]] to [[1996]], and was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. He was very popular among the Gryffindors in school, and he and George were well known for their senses of humour and pranks. The twins even set up their own joke shop in the disused bathroom on the seventh floor. 

Among Fred's many friends were: [[Lee Jordan]], [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Oliver Wood]], and [[Katie Bell]]. 

Fred and George first started pranking in their Hogwarts years when they swiped the [[Marauder's Map]] from [[Argus Filch]]'s office.

It was noted by Ron Weasley on the Hogwarts Express that Fred and George achieved <nowiki>'</nowiki>''really good marks''<nowiki/>' despite being avid pranksters; them achieving high marks was mostly in their early years at Hogwarts.

First year

Fred started his [[first year]] at Hogwarts in the [[1989–1990 school year]]. At the start of the school year, he and George introduced themselves to the [[Hogwarts Librarian]] [[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]] by re-organising the [[Hogwarts Library|library]] shelves, much to her anger. They introduced themselves to [[Jacob's sibling]] in the library, who was with Charlie and Percy, and told them to avoid Pince, with George leaving for detention that Fred was responsible for. Fred promised to take the blame next time, with Percy lecturing them for causing trouble so early in the school year.

During the return of [[William Weasley]] to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], he and his brother went missing, and during [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Charles Weasley]]'s searches, they come to [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]]'s painting. At first he pretended to be unwilling to help them because of the twins' rude personalities and insulting him and Merlin, but after asking Jacob's sibling if they would have helped if they were in his shoes, he admitted that a knight must help others in need no matter what. While helping, he also admitted that he challenged the twins into a duel but they had just laughed and left.

During he and his brother's time in the kitchens, [[Pitts]], the house-elf in charge of the kitchens, gave one of them a broom for the purpose of cleaning, but he thought Pitts wanted him to fly. And during their time in detention, one of them burnt water, which was noted to be 'impossible' by [[Jae Kim]]. And in the meantime, one of them mixed up mayonnaise with paste, so Pitts forced him to scrub the whole kitchen with his toothbrush.

They were so bad at cooking that one of the house-elves in the kitchens stated that compared to them, Jacob's sibling was a master chef.

Also during this school year, he and George expressed interest in becoming members of the [[Circle of Khanna]], a student organisation dedicated to the memory of [[Rowan Khanna]], combating '[[R]]' and finding the final [[Sunken Vault|Cursed Vault]]. He and George went to a meeting of this society in [[Classroom 1B]], where [[Jae Kim]] managed to convince [[Jacob's sibling]] in [[Classroom 3C]] to let them both join, as they were younger students. Jacob's sibling went back to Classroom 1B with Jae where the other students explained their plans to them.

Second year

In their [[second year]] in the [[1990–1991 school year]], Fred and George became [[Beater]]s for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. They both used [[Cleansweep Five]] broomsticks and were so skilled at [[Quidditch]] that they were both described as being like '[[Human]] [[Bludger]]s'.

Also during this second year, he and Fred attended a meeting of the Circle of Khanna in Classroom 3C, where they and other students were updated by Jacob's sibling on important news and information relevant to the society.


Later during this school year, Fred and George, with the planned help of [[Peeves]], stole [[Victor Ketsueki]]'s [[Victor Ketsueki's coffin|coffin]] as a prank, but the twins never showed up with the coffin to Peeves in his [[Peeves' Room|room]]. He thought it would be a fun prank, as Victor in his mind had become too egotistical after becoming a [[vampire]]. Fred intended for Victor to find the coffin, as he had filled it with a glitter bomb. When Jacob's sibling found Fred boasting about this prank to a group of students in the [[Clock Tower Courtyard]], where he told them the nature of his prank and how it was in the [[Hogwarts kitchens]], Jacob's sibling was surprised with them. Fred and George later went to the kitchens, and when Victor opened it, they laughed as he got covered in glitter, as it ruined his gothic appearance.

During this year, he and George developed early prototypes for the [[Skiving Snackbox]], which fellow Gryffindor [[Jae Kim]] took from their rooms and read.

Third year


s]]

Fred also became friends with [[Harry Potter]] in his third year, when Harry palled around with his younger brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and was made the Quidditch team's [[Seeker]]. Fred and the other players believed that the addition of Harry would be a real shot in the arm to their chances of winning the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]]. Around the [[Christmas]] holidays, Fred and George got in trouble for bewitching several [[snowball]]s to follow [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] around, and hit him in the [[Tom Riddle#Search for the Philosopher's Stone|back of the head]] (they were, of course, unaware that they were throwing snowballs in Voldemort's face).

They stayed in the castle for the holidays along with their brothers and Harry, all of whom received [[British terms#J|jumpers]] from [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]]. The jumpers she sent to Fred and [[George Weasley|George]] didn't have their initials on them as Harry's and Ron's did, prompting them to call themselves 'Gred and Forge'. The twins also dragged [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] away from his fellow [[prefect]]s, insisting that Christmas was time for family, and stole his prefect badge, much to his irritation.

Fourth year




In the summer of 1992, Fred, George, and Ron rescued Harry from his relatives' home after not hearing from him during the previous summer month. They pulled the bars off his window and flew him to the[[the Burrow| Burrow]] in their father's [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]]. While at the Burrow Fred and George came to know Harry better as they spent time flying with him. The twins soon began their fourth year at Hogwarts, and took to teasing their younger sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] as she began her first year. They were trying to cheer her up, unaware that her emotional state was fragile due to the influence of [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's Diary]].


That year, the Chamber of Secrets was opened and frighting messages were written on the castle walls. Rumours were circulating that Harry was responsible for it, since he spoke [[Parseltongue]] and thus might be the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]]. Neither Fred nor George took these rumours seriously, they found the whole thing laughable and frequently joked about it (apparently taking Harry though crowded corridors shouting, 'Make way!'). They also came to [[Hermione Granger]]'s defence when [[Draco Malfoy]] called her a <nowiki>'</nowiki>''filthy little [[Mudblood]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, by lunging at him, only to be blocked by [[Slytherin Quidditch team|Slytherin Quidditch]] [[Quidditch Captain|Captain]] [[Marcus Flint]].

Fred helped protect Harry form a rogue [[Bludger]] during Gryffindor's opening match against Slytherin. After Gryffindor won the Quidditch match, Fred went to the hospital wing with the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team to see Harry because [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] had removed all the bones in his arm, and congratulated him for his unbelievable flying, but not before seeing Marcus Flint yelling at Draco Malfoy for <nowiki>'</nowiki>''having the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] on top of his head and not noticing''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, of which he informed Harry. At the end of the school year, Fred was relieved when his younger sister was saved — and delighted when she revealed that Percy had a secret girlfriend, as this was another opportunity to take the mickey out of him.


[[Arthur Weasley]] had won a large amount of gold from a Ministry contest, something that was both a surprise and delight for the family. The Weasleys used the money won that summer to take a holiday to [[Egypt]], where the oldest son [[William Weasley|Bill]] was working as a [[Curse-Breaker|Curse Breaker]]. While there, Fred and George tried to push Percy, who had been acting even more arrogant and pompous than usual, because he learned he had been appointed [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]], into a pyramid. Their mother stopped them and scolded them severely. They and their brothers went in all the pyramids. They also annoyed [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] when she couldn't go in the last one, most likely because her their mother thought her too young.

Fifth year



In Harry's third year and their fifth, Fred and George gave Harry the [[Marauder's Map]], as they already knew it by heart and Harry needed it in order to sneak into [[Hogsmeade]]. They also tried to cheer him up after he fainted near the [[Dementor]]s that were guarding the school that year, due to [[Sirius Black]] [[Azkaban escapes#1993|escaping]] from [[Azkaban]]. Their attempt to cheer up Ron after his pet rat [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]] went missing was not as successful, as Fred and George reminded him that Scabbers was boring. That year, they also won the Quidditch Cup along with Harry.

 to collect Harry for the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]]]
Fred and George began inventing magical prank items the summer of 1994, starting with the [[Ton-Tongue Toffee]], which Fred 'dropped' near Harry's cousin [[Dudley Dursley]] in order to test it out, which proved to be  very successful. Fred also attended the [[Quidditch World Cup]] with his parents, siblings, [[Harry Potter]], and [[Hermione Granger]], and gambled all of his money on the outcome, which their father told them not to mention to their mother. When [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] defaulted on his bet, Fred was furious, and suggested that it was <nowiki>'</nowiki>''time to play dirty''<nowiki>'</nowiki> like Bagman by informing the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] of his activities. George was against the idea, arguing that it was blackmail.

Sixth year


 that Fred attended with his family and friends]]

Once at school for their sixth year (before their sixth year they attended the Quidditch World Cup with their family), George and Fred began selling, as well as experimenting with, their inventions. That year, Hogwarts also hosted the [[Triwizard Tournament]], which Fred and George both wanted to enter, despite being underage. They attempted to fool the [[Age Line]] spell that [[Albus Dumbledore]] put around the [[Goblet of Fire]] using an Ageing Potion, but the attempt was unsuccessful, though they both thought their beards were uproariously funny.

]]

The twins began trying out and selling their products, such as [[Canary Cream]]s, at Hogwarts as their sixth year began. When the [[Yule Ball]] was announced, Fred asked Angelina Johnson to attend with him, declaring it a 'piece of cake' to ask a girl out. Angelina said yes and they went to the ball together. At the end of the school year, [[Cedric Diggory]], one of the champions, was murdered by [[Peter Pettigrew]] on the orders of the newly revived [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], who was reborn.

Seventh year




In the summer of 1995, before their final year at Hogwarts, Fred, and George passed their [[Apparition (class)|Apparition]] tests 'with distinction,' and took to [[Apparition|Apparating]] and [[Apparition|Disapparating]] around [[12 Grimmauld Place]] to surprise people, much to the displeasure of their mother. They helped clean up the headquarters of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], but they also pocketed [[Doxy|Doxies]] from behind the curtains (and possibly [[Wartcap powder]]) for their experiments, and spied on the Order's meetings using the [[Extendable Ears]] they invented (although most of the time the Ears proved useless as the door was often [[Imperturbable Charm|Imperturbed]]).

 meeting]]

Fred and George resumed testing and selling their products at Hogwarts in their seventh year, though [[Hermione Granger]] managed to prevent them from testing out [[Skiving Snackbox]]es on unsuspecting first years by threatening to tell their mother.The twins also joined Dumbledore's Army to oppose the dictatorial running of Hogwarts under High Inquisitor [[Dolores Umbridge]], and to prepare to fight [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].

Umbridge kicked them both off the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] that year after George and Harry got into a fight with [[Draco Malfoy]], who had penned the demeaning song ''[[Weasley is Our King]]'' to humiliate [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and then proceeded to insult the Weasley parents and the late [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]]. Fred would have participated in the fight, but was held back by three of his team-mates. The Weasleys suffered a near-devastating blow that Christmas when [[Arthur Weasley]] was bitten by [[Nagini]], Lord Voldemort's pet [[snake]]. Fred was greatly upset by his father's injury, especially since [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] did not join his family at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], deepening his estrangement.

Leaving Hogwarts


When the D.A. was discovered later in the school year, [[Albus Dumbledore]] took the blame and departed Hogwarts, leaving Umbridge as Headmistress. Fred and George decided that they no longer cared about getting into trouble, and that they were going to cause as much mayhem for Umbridge as possible. When the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] was formed and one member, [[Graham Montague]], attempted to dock House Points from them, Fred and George shoved him head-first into a [[Vanishing Cabinet]] before he could finish speaking.



They set off spectacular fireworks of their own creation, [[Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs]], which soon became best-selling products. After taking their disruptive activities easy during the Easter holidays, Fred dropped out of Hogwarts with George in a final act of rebellion against Umbridge. They left in a flourish of vandalism, chaos, and hexing members of the Inquisitorial Squad. A small part of a [[Portable Swamp]] created in the corridors by the twins was preserved by [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], as he saw it as a <nowiki>'</nowiki>''really good bit of magic''<nowiki>'</nowiki>.


Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes




Initially, Fred and George's ambitions to open a joke shop had been something of a disappointment to their parents, in particular their mother, who had hoped they would seek employment with the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] like their father. However, the spectacular success of the twins' business, [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], located at 93 [[Diagon Alley]], immensely impressed them both and became a source of much joy and pride in their sons accomplishment. What had started out as a mail-order experiment in entrepreneurship skyrocketed into a very lucrative undertaking. In fact, it was so successful that in [[1996]], the twins had moved out of their childhood home and into a flat above the shop; later, the twins considered buying [[Zonko's Joke Shop]] in [[Hogsmeade]], which had closed the previous year.



None of this would have been possible without the funding [[Harry Potter]] had given them in 1995. For Harry's generosity, the twins allowed him to take any merchandise free of charge. In the summer of 1996 Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger]] visited the shop. Fred showed Harry around, showing him the wide verity of products in the back. He also offered Hermione a [[Patented Daydream Charm]] for free after she called them 'extraordinary magic', but still charged Ron for his purchases. Ron also made some rude gestures at Fred for having him pay, which, to his misfortune, Mrs Weasley saw. Fred and George also questioned [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] on her love life and how she was moving through boys too quickly, much to her irritation.

]]

That Christmas, the twins stayed at the [[the Burrow|Burrow]] for the holidays. When [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] arrived with [[Minister for Magic]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]], and it became clear that the two had only come so that the Minister could question Harry, Fred threw mashed parsnips at his older brother, along with George and Ginny, causing Percy to leave swiftly. In 1996, Fred appeared at King's Cross Station wearing a [[dragon-skin coat]]. These are very expensive and Fred was only able to buy it due to the fact that <nowiki>'</nowiki>''[[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|business]] was booming''.<nowiki>'</nowiki>


Battle of the Seven Potters




As supporters of Albus Dumbledore, George and Fred both joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]] once they were of age. They participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters, along with their father and their younger brother Ron. Fred and George took [[Polyjuice Potion]] to become one of the 'seven Potters'. While in Privet Drive they also tried numerous times to lighten the mood.



Once in the air a large group of Death Eaters attacked the Order members and their charges, this led to a massive sky battle. Fred flew with his father on a broomstick, it is unknown what happened to them during the battle. He was upset to learn that his twin had lost an ear due to a ''[[Sectumsempra]]'' [[curse]] at the hands of [[Severus Snape]]. There was nothing that could be done about George's ear, as it had been cursed off with [[Dark Arts|Dark magic]]. Although initially panicked to the point of being speechless when he saw his twin's loss, as soon as George started joking about it, Fred calmed down.

Wedding of Bill and Fleur


That same summer, Fred and George eagerly flirted with two '[[Delacour sisters' cousins|pretty French girls]]', who came to the Burrow to attend their brother [[William Weasley|Bill]]'s wedding to Fleur Delacour. It is possible that these girls might have been related to Fleur. He also reminisced about his late uncle [[Bilius]], to the entertainment of George, Ron, Harry, and Hermione. Discussing how Billius used to down a whole bottle of [[Firewhisky|Firewhiskey]], go out on to the dance floor left up his robes and pull out bunches of flowers. It is unknown whether or not Fred was still present at the wedding when Death Eaters stormed the wedding looking for Harry Potter.

Potterwatch


When the [[Second Wizarding War|war]] reached its worst point in late [[1997]] and [[1998]], Fred participated under the code names 'Rodent' and later 'Rapier' in ''Potterwatch'', a radio programme hosted by his friend [[Lee Jordan]] that opposed Voldemort's reign of terror. They spread the truth about the Death Eater regime that was not being reported by the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' or other news outlets, and encouraged the public to support Harry Potter and to protect [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s and wizards alike who were falling victim to the Death Eaters.

[[Battle of Hogwarts]] and death




Fred, along with his family and friends, returned to Hogwarts in the spring to participate in the final battle. He and George were assigned to defend the castle's secret passages by [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]. When the [[Death Eaters]] forced their way inside, Fred fought next to his brother [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], who had recently been reconciled with the family and combated his former boss, [[Imperius Curse|Imperiused]] [[Minister for Magic]] [[Pius Thicknesse]], transfiguring him.



While fighting, Fred was killed in an explosion outside the [[Room of Requirement]] by an unknown Death Eater. One of the last things Fred heard before dying was Percy joking about resigning from the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. Percy wouldn't leave Fred's side until Harry helped him move the body to somewhere safer, coincidentally behind a suit of armour. His body was later moved to the [[Great Hall]], where family and friends then mourned over him. 




His whole family, including extended family and friends such as Harry and Hermione, were devastated when Fred died. Ron and Harry came very close to forgetting their primary goal of hunting down Voldemort's remaining [[Horcrux]]es in the wake of Fred's death, being so enraged that they wished to hunt down Death Eaters to kill, with only Hermione's persuasiveness were they able to restrain themselves. Percy became extremely furious that he chased down Rookwood in an attempt at revenge, and Molly was utterly murderous when [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] mocked her of Fred's death, to the point of killing her with astounding duelling skills instantly. 

The rest of the Weasley family survived to see the downfall of Voldemort and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War|war]]. His twin brother George later had [[Fred Weasley II|a son]] whom he named Fred in honour of his lost brother.

In the 2010s, Fred's past self appeared as a [[Foundable]] in two different instances during the [[Calamity]]. In the first, he appeared wearing a [[Weasley jumper]] with the letter F for his first name on the front, hounded by a pair of [[Howler]] [[Confoundable]]s. Volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] had to cast the [[Fire-Making Spell]] in order to disperse them. Fred also appeared alongside his Yule Ball date, Angelina, trapped by a snowstorm Confoundable, which required the usage of [[Meteolojinx Recanto]] in order to dispel it and return the pair to their own time.





Fred, similar to all the [[Weasley family|Weasley]] children, had a head of flaming-red hair and abundant freckles. He had a shorter and stockier build, like his brothers [[George Weasley|George]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], rather than a tall, thin build like his brothers [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]].

He also has a big nose, like Molly.




]]

Fred Weasley was the more outgoing, daring, and sarcastic of the twins. During the rescue from the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] in [[1992]], [[George Weasley|George]] [[Lock picking|picked]] the lock on Harry's bedroom door with a hairpin, while Fred insisted [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] tricks were important to know, even if it was 'a bit slow', and 'accidentally dropped' a [[Ton-Tongue Toffee]] for [[Dudley Dursley]] to find and eat. Fred concocted the scheme of trying to fool [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s Age Line to get into the [[Triwizard Tournament]], though it was unsuccessful, and was in favour of blackmailing [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] after he defaulted on a bet, while George had reservations.

Fred tended to take the ringleader role in their pranks, but was also crueller in his humour or in dealing with those he disliked; for example, he and George had absolutely no compunction in forcing [[Graham Montague|Montague]] into a [[Vanishing Cabinet]], an act which, according to [[Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]], nearly killed him. However, it is possible that he was unaware that the cabinet was broken and thought Montague would have stumbled out of another cabinet, too confused to remember to dock points from them, as he initially was planning to do. Fred could be quite callous in dealing with the victims of his pranks, particularly his older brother [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], but was more compassionate when he did not feel that the victim deserved it; he immediately provided [[Hermione Granger]] with [[bruise removal paste]] after she was accidentally given a black eye by the twins' [[boxing telescope]]. Fred was also the first to forgive Percy when he reconciled with the family.

Both he and George were renowned for their senses of humour; they were able to make people laugh and relax even in very difficult times. Neither Fred nor George took school very seriously, but they were both very talented wizards, and demonstrated their ingenuity in their inventions and their business sense in running a highly lucrative shop. They were also staunchly loyal to their loved ones and very brave,(as evidenced by their been sorted into [[Gryffindor]]) and unafraid to stand up against what they thought was wrong, whether it was [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s tyranny at Hogwarts or [[Death Eaters]].




Although not a high achiever academically, Fred was a very gifted and creative [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. He and [[George Weasley|his brother]] were extremely skilled at charming and bewitching items. [[Harry Potter]] once expressed bewilderment as to how he and George received only three [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] each, remarking that they <nowiki>'</nowiki>''really know their stuff''<nowiki>'</nowiki>. When the twins turned seventeen, they were able to use [[magic]] outside of Hogwarts and took full advantage of this. They did everything by [magic] and frequently [[Apparition|Apparated]] around [[12 Grimmauld Place]] and the [[the Burrow|Burrow]].



*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Fred was a highly talented [[Beater]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] from his second year on. [[Oliver Wood]] described Fred and George as 'unbeatable' and [[Harry Potter]] thought that they flew like two 'human [[Bludger]]s', which many other people were known to describe them as as well. Fred was an excellent [[Flight|flyer]] and had highly precise aim, as proven in [[1992]], when he smashed a [[Bludger]] with exceptional aim towards [[Draco Malfoy]], even though Malfoy had the fastest broom of the day, and Fred only a [[Cleansweep Five]]. In fact, he only missed because of [[Dobby]] the house-elf's intervention. After the twins left Hogwarts, Harry lamented that he was never able to find replacements as talented as they were for the team. He also showed highly skilled control of a broomstick when escaping Hogwarts in [[1995]].



, one of Fred and George's many inventions]]

*'''[[Charm]]s''': One of the few [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] Fred bothered to achieve was in Charms, a subject he and George were extremely talented in. Their skilled spellwork was necessary for many of their magical inventions for [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]]. Charms professor [[Filius Flitwick]] was so impressed by their [[Portable Swamp]] that he left a portion of it intact within [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Fred was also able to produce a fully corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] in the form of a [[Magpie]], a mark of his considerable proficiency and talent in charms, given the immense difficulty of casting such an advanced and difficult protective charm.



*'''[[Magic]]al device invention''': Fred was highly talented in the skill of inventing of original magical items. Along with George, Fred invented a wide variety of magical items for their shop. Some notable items include [[Extendable Ears]], which can be used to eavesdrop on others, a series of [[Skiving Snackbox|sickness-inducing sweets]], and [[Patented Daydream Charm]]s, which [[Hermione Granger]] considered to be 'extraordinary magic'. Fred and George also invented items for protection rather than pranks, such as [[Decoy Detonator]]s and [[Shield Hat]]s; the latter were purchased by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] itself for its employees as a protection method during the [[Second Wizarding War]].



*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Fred was proficient it transfiguration; it was one of the few [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] Fred ever tried to achieve. He was shown to be talented with [[transformation]], given how he successfully [[Teddy bear to spider spell|turned]] a [[teddy bear]] into a [[spider]] when he was a young boy, and also effortlessly [[Transforming Spells|transformed]] a [[Knife to paper aeroplane spell|knife into a paper aeroplane]] with one lazy flick of his wand, showing his talent in this field.
*'''[[Potion]]s''': As part-owner of [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasley's Wizard Wheezes]], Fred was quite skilled in creating new [[potion]]s, most of the time with positive, humorous effects. He and Fred invented several [[Love Potion|love potions]] as part of their [[WonderWitch]] line of feminine products, showing his proficiency in potion-making, as love potions are known to be advanced brews.
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Fred was skilled in Defence Against the Dark Arts; he achieved an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in it and further improved his skills in [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Fred's talent at defence would contribute to his ability to invent Defence Against the Dark Arts items with George such as [[Decoy Detonator]]s, and to obtain rare and useful defence items such as [[Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder]]. Fred also joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]] at a young age, and participated in a number of its operations. He fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and came out unscathed, and in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], during which he defeated a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] opponent and was in charge of guarding the secret school passages, along with George.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Fred was a skilled duelist even though he only fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. He survived the Battle of the Seven Potters uninjured, and defeated many [[Death Eaters]] prior to his death in the Battle of Hogwarts, showing his excellent skills in [[martial magic]] to have participated in such violent and dangerous conflicts.

*'''Muggle tricks''': Despite being [[pure-blood]]s and raised entirely in the [[wizarding world]], Fred and George recognised the usefulness of certain [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] abilities, and mastered several skills that they found amusing or useful, such as [[lock picking]]. As such, they launched a line of Muggle conjuring tricks in their shop, 'for freaks like [[Arthur Weasley|Dad]]', according to Fred, even though it was not much of a seller. However one girl was impressed enough that Fred quipped that they were almost like real magic. This may have been influenced by their father, [[Arthur Weasley]], who also was interested in Muggles. This also demonstrates Fred and George's ingenuity, as not many people born into the magical world are familiar with Muggle devices or skills.



*'''[[Hogwarts secret passages|Hogwarts secret passageways]] expert''': Ever since Fred swiped the [[Marauder's Map]] from [[Argus Filch]]'s [[Caretaker's filing cabinet|office]] with George, they had a great knowledge of all of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] grounds including the secret passageways. Fred even once commented that the Map had taught him more at school than the professors had. The twins' knowledge of the grounds were second only to the [[Marauders]]. They seemed to have memorised the Map entirely, as they gave it to Harry in his third year and still remembered everything. This knowledge allowed Fred to tell [[Hermione Granger]] where the [[Hogwarts kitchens]] were, and for him and George to lead the defence of the school's secret passages during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].



*'''[[Apparition]]''': Fred and George managed to pass their Apparition tests sometime prior to their final year in Hogwarts, apparently 'with distinction'. To celebrate their coming of age of being allowed to use magic outside of school, as well as making travelling a close distance easier, they both took to Apparating as often as possible, even over very short distances.

*'''[[Herbology]]''': Along with George, Fred was highly skilled in Herbology. He presumably took it in his sixth and seventh year, as he went to sell some Extendable Ears with George before a Herbology class in their seventh year. He was even capable, along with George, with experimenting with [[Venomous Tentacula]] seeds in the production of some of their [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], showing his skill in the subject.



*'''Business''': As Fred co-owned [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] alongside his brother George after leaving Hogwarts, his business skills were quite good, especially as they were able to operate it through Owl Orders before they purchased the main property at Diagon Alley, and when they were on the run before the Battle of Hogwarts.



*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Non-verbal magic]]''': Fred was skilled at [[nonverbal spell]]s, indicating a high degree of talent and discipline with [[magic]]. He once [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] a sprout knife [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] threw at him [[Knife to paper aeroplane spell|into a paper aeroplane]] with nothing more than 'one lazy flick of his wand'.




*'''[[Fred Weasley's wand|Wand]]''': Fred Weasley's [[wand]] had been bought in [[1989]], if it was bought when he was eleven. Although it was most likely bought second-hand like many of the Weasley Family's possessions, the [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] of Fred Weasley's wand was unknown. It is probable that the wand is most suitable for transfiguration and charm-work, due to Fred's talents and choice of subjects at Hogwarts.


*'''[[Marauder's Map]]''': Along with George, Fred 'nicked' the Marauder's Map from a drawer in Filch's office, during their first year. Sometime between then and [[1993]], he and George figured out how to unlock and erase the Map. He used the map ever since until [[1993]], when he gave the map to [[Harry Potter]] in order for him to sneak into [[Hogsmeade]].



*'''[[Cleansweep Five]]''': Fred and his twin each flew on a [[Cleansweep Five]] [[broomstick]] when they played as [[Beater]]s for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. Their use of such outdated [[broomstick]]s was likely due to [[Weasley family|their family]]'s financial problems. Despite this, the twins were still very skilled in flying and as Beaters.[[Draco Malfoy]], <nowiki>'</nowiki>''who could always afford the best'',' insulted Fred and George's vintage brooms by saying that a museum would bid for them. Their brooms, along with [[Harry Potter]]'s, were confiscated by [[Dolores Umbridge]] when they assaulted Malfoy for insulting their families. After the twins released a [[Portable Swamp]] in defiance to the woman, they used a [[Summoning Charm]] to retrieve their brooms from her office, and used them to fly out of Hogwarts as a final act of rebellion. The broomsticks created two rather large holes in Umbridge's door.
*'''Prank and joke items''': Including the items that he had already made, Fred owned a large collection of magical prank items that he had bought from [[Zonko's Joke Shop]] to help with their own development and enjoyment for pranks. These included [[Dungbomb]]s, [[Dr Filibuster's Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks]], [[Boxing telescope]]s, and [[Stink Pellets]].
*'''[[Toy broomstick]]''': Fred owned a toy broomstick, which his youngest brother, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], accidentally broke in [[1983]]. In revenge, Fred [[Teddy bear to spider spell|turned]] Ron's [[teddy bear]] into a large [[spider]], leading Ron to become extremely arachnophobic.



The Weasleys

: twin, best friend, and partner in crime]]
George Weasley was Fred's twin, best friend, and partner in crime. They were about as close as two brothers can be. They did just about everything together. They often finished each other's sentences and spoke in a back and forth way that could confuse others at times. Together, Fred and George designed many ingenious pranks and shared the ambition to found a [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|joke shop]] together. They were also both [[Beater]]s for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] and close friends with [[Lee Jordan]].

George was devastated by the death of his twin in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and would never truly get over this loss. He eventually named his firstborn [[Fred Weasley II|son]] after Fred.



 on holiday in Egypt|left]]
Like his younger siblings, Fred tended to look up to his older brothers [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]]. However, he and George delighted in teasing [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], who was closer to their age and very different from them in personality. Their [[Molly Weasley|mother]] was always encouraging the twins to be more like Percy, who was responsible and academically motivated, but Fred and George thought him to be stuffy and arrogant. Thus, they frequently mocked any behaviour they saw as arrogant on his part, such as his pride in his position as a school [[prefect]].


, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], [[George Weasley|George]], and Fred in [[1995]]]]
The twins were the angriest with Percy when he became estranged with the rest of the family over their support of [[Albus Dumbledore]] and [[Harry Potter]] instead of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], but also seemed the most inclined to ask about him during his estrangement, as Fred asked their mother if Percy was coming home for the [[Christmas holidays]] in [[1996]]. Fred was the first to accept Percy's apology during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and he and George subsequently acted as if the split had never happened. During the battle, Fred and Percy fought side by side, and Percy was devastated over his brother's death, fiercely protecting his body and furiously pursuing [[Augustus Rookwood]].


, his little brother]]
The twins also enjoyed teasing their only younger brother, Ron. Notably, Fred transfigured his [[teddy bear]] into a [[spider]] after Ron broke his [[toy broomstick]], and teased him over his embarrassing crush on [[Fleur Delacour]]. Fred and George sometimes pestered Ron to the point of infuriating him, such as when they mocked him for becoming a [[prefect]], a position Ron never tried to use against them.

However, they also helped Ron out, such as by giving him a copy of ''[[Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches]]'' and aiding him in transfiguring the [[Weasley family ghoul]] to resemble Ron with [[spattergroit]] as his cover while he was hunting [[Horcrux]]es with Harry and Hermione. Fred was quite close to his sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], who was similar to the twins in temperament, and sometimes joined them in teasing others, especially Ron. They were protective of her, as well, and disapproved of her love life, it is unknown to Fred that Harry and Ginny were going out during her fifth and his sixth year and then dated after the battle and then married.

Following his death, Fred gained seven nieces and five nephews.



 and [[Molly Weasley]], his parents]]

Like most members of the [[Weasley family]], Fred got on well with his parents. The atmosphere was generally light, relaxed and casual.

Molly Weasley was often described as the only one Fred and George were afraid of, and was often unhappy with Fred's lack of seriousness and commitment to his learning. She was unhappy with both his earning of only three [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] and desire to own a joke shop. However, Mrs Weasley loved him very much and was devastated by her son's death during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], on [[2 May]] [[1998]] and was seen crying over his dead body.

Arthur Weasley was more laid back than his wife. While not overly supportive of Fred's wrongdoing, he seemed to encourage the trying of new things. Mr Weasley was excited when informed of Fred's adventure rescuing [[Harry Potter]] from the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] and only pretended to be strict. However, he was cranky when Fred slipped [[Dudley Dursley]] an enchanted toffee. Mr Weasley was immensely saddened by Fred's death, and was seen with his wife near his dead body.

Harry Potter

, his friend and future brother-in-law]]
Fred first met Harry Potter in his [[1991|third year]] at Hogwarts, when Harry was beginning his first year and needed help on the train; then Harry became friends with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]]. The twins became friendly with him when he joined the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] as their [[Seeker]], giving them hope to win the [[House Cup]]. After Harry Potter's [[Skirmish in the Underground Chambers|encounter with Quirinus Quirrell]], the twins were responsible for trying to send him a toilet seat to amuse him, but it was confiscated by Madam Pomfrey because it wasn't very hygienic.

The [[1992|following year]], Fred and George cheered Harry up when many of the students believed that he might be the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]], which they scoffed at, and the year after that, they gave him the [[Marauder's Map]] to help him sneak into [[Hogsmeade]]. They also stood up for Harry when others doubted his claim that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned or challenged his authority in [[Dumbledore's Army]], and assisted him in contacting [[Sirius Black]] when he told them and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] of his desire to speak to his godfather. Both twins risked their lives in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters|operation]] to remove Harry from his [[4 Privet Drive|relatives' home]] in [[1997]].

They seemed to regard Harry almost as another younger sibling, and were inclined both to be protective of him and teasing of him. Fred even stated that it was time for Harry to 'play with the big boys' in Harry's third year when he was excluded from the Hogsmeade visit and Fred as well as George stayed behind with him. Harry was devastated by Fred's death during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] to the point where he felt like the world had ended, though he could not bring himself to join the Weasleys' small group around his body.

He eventually became Fred's brother-in-law through his marriage to [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]].

Hermione Granger

, his friend and future sister-in-law]]
Fred became friendly with Hermione Granger after she became a close friend to his younger brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]]. Although Hermione disapproved of some of the twins' antics, since she was a [[Prefect]], she generally got on fairly well with them. They seemed to regard Hermione like a sister, due to her relationship with Ron and as she is always trying to keep them on track, despite being almost two years younger than them.

They were outraged when [[Draco Malfoy]] called her a '[[Mudblood]]' in [[1992]], to the point of attempting to physically attack him. Hermione also warned Fred and his twin brother that their [[Ageing Potion]] would not trick the age line protecting the [[Goblet of Fire]] due to the fact that Dumbledore would have thought of a foolish ageing potion in advance. They found out she was right when they were blown backwards and grew long, white beards. Fred and George also tried to get Hermione to relax, joking around with her about things such as their late uncle [[Bilius]]'s penchant for making mischief at weddings.

Hermione also admired the twins' cleverness and creativity in their spell work, once remarking that they could do some 'extraordinary magic,' though she did not agree with how they put it to use. Hermione was also one of the few people willing to stand up to Fred and George when she disagreed with them. For example, when she caught them testing sweets from the [[Skiving Snackbox]] on first-year students with [[Lee Jordan]], she was furious, and told them off for what she considered taking advantage of innocent children. Fred and George initially scoffed at her concerns and at her ability to make them stop, but backed down when she threatened to tell their [[Molly Weasley|mother]]. However, the twins did not seem to hold a grudge, as they continued to be friendly; Fred even later gave Hermione [[Patented Daydream Charm|material]] from the [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|joke shop]] free of charge. She was saddened by the death of Fred, comforting a swollen-eyed Ginny.

Hermione would eventually become Fred's sister-in-law through her marriage to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]].

Angelina Johnson

, his Yule Ball date]]

Angelina Johnson was a [[Gryffindor]] in Fred's year at Hogwarts, and was on the house [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|Quidditch team]] with him and George. They were good friends; Fred asked her with complete confidence and rather casually to go to the [[Yule Ball]], and she accepted nonchalantly, but with <nowiki>'</nowiki>''a bit of a grin on her face''<nowiki>'</nowiki>.

The [[1995|following year]], Angelina became Captain of the [[Quidditch team]] and was annoyed with Fred and George when they were kicked off the team by [[Dolores Umbridge]], as it hurt the team's chances. Angelina did not attend [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] as Fred's date, and he flirted with [[Delacour sisters' cousins|cousins]] of the bride while there. However, the two seemed to still be on friendly terms, as they fought alongside one another during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

Angelina would go on to marry George and they even named their only [[Fred Weasley II|son]] after Fred, as a means of honouring his memory.

, his former professor and head of house]]

Minerva McGonagall was the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] teacher during Fred and his brother, George's years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Although McGonagall was always well known for being strict and stern, but she was never shown punishing or even telling off Fred and George for their wild behaviour and many pranks. It was known however that they were good [[Quidditch]] players from a good family, and she was visibly displeased with having Fred, George, and Harry kicked off the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]].

McGonagall often perceived the twins as troublemakers but seemed to share their dislike of [[Dolores Umbridge]], who was the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher for a small time. McGonagall did not attempt to remove the fireworks that surfaced around the school causing great disruptions. When Fred made his legendary escape in [[1996]], McGonagall assisted [[Peeves]] to unscrew an overhead chandelier. It was Fred's desire that such mayhem existed.


[[Lee Jordan]] was best friends with Fred and George during his time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and often got into trouble along with them. They were good friends and they both appeared to have affection for Angelina Johnson. In [[1995]] they joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and Lee helped the twins harass [[Dolores Umbridge]], one incident of which resulted in him being punished by 'writing lines', scarring his hand. In the [[1997–1998 school year]], during the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Fred was a guest on ''[[Potterwatch|Potter Watch]]'', the resistance radio show Lee hosted. In May of [[1998]], Lee returned with Fred and George to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].




Fred and George had a good relationship with many [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] professors. Professor [[Filius Flitwick]], the [[Charms (class)|Charms]] professor and [[Head of Ravenclaw House]], seemed to like them and he was very happy with their spell work. He also thought that they were very talented wizards and supported them in rebelling against [[Dolores Umbridge]] in [[1995]]. When Fred and George set off fireworks around the grounds she spent a day running around putting them out. After she had finished inspecting Flitwick's classroom, he told her that he could have put them all out easily, but was concerned he didn't have the authority to do so.

After Easter break, the twins used one of their inventions, a [[Portable Swamp]] to change a corridor and several courtyards into swamps, shortly afterwards they departed from school to go into the world of business. Flitwick was seen cheering and supporting them at their departure after they circled around Umbridge and Filch. Flitwick was asked to remove the swamp they created, which he did but left a small patch in the corner as he believed it to be really good magic.





Fred and George were friends of [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor, throughout their time at Hogwarts. Hagrid seemed to be one of their favourite members of the staff, as he was not too serious and very tolerant, as many other professors were viewed as. They were also among the few people who still believed that Hagrid was a great person, even after they learned that he was a [[half-giant]]. Hagrid thought that Fred and George were trouble-makers, but still very funny.

He once compared them with [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and [[Sirius Black]]. Furthermore, they were all among Harry Potter's closest friends. Fred and George fought in the [[Second Wizarding War]] along with Hagrid. However, during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], he, [[George Weasley|George]], and [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] split up. Fred, meanwhile, met up with his older brother, Percy, and together they duelled [[Pius Thicknesse]]. However, Fred was killed in the explosion soon afterward.

, his former headmaster]]



Both Fred and George appeared to respect the headmaster Albus Dumbledore. They, like many others, thought that he was the greatest wizard of all time. He seemed to like them as well, despite the fact that they did stir up trouble; He knew they were good people at heart.

Along with George, Fred joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation founded by Dumbledore, in order to oppose [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. They also joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], in [[1995]], an army founded and led by Harry to oppose the Ministry's interference.






The twins also disliked [[Argus Filch]], the caretaker. Filch had punished them many times during their [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] years, because they were trouble-makers. Fred also 'nicked' the [[Marauder's Map]] from Filch, while he and George were in trouble in his office. Filch had a great knowledge of all Hogwarts' secret passageways, only beaten by Fred and George's. When [[Dolores Umbridge]] was appointed at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Filch supported her, and tried to punish the twins again. However, Fred and George escaped [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], flying with their broomsticks.






Fred and George disliked [[Severus Snape]] the potions master. Snape disliked them, too. This could be because of the fact that the Weasley twins were trouble-makers, like Snape's schoolboy rivals the [[Marauders]], especially [[James Potter I]] and [[Sirius Black]]. Snape was eventually charged with being Death Eater; however, he was a double agent and working for the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He accidentally hit George with a [[Sectumsempra]] spell, while aiming at a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Fred never learned that Snape was on the Order's side due to the former's death.



Fred and George hated [[Dolores Umbridge]] with a passion, who was appointed by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] as the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor in [[1995]]. Umbridge was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students. Almost every resident of Hogwarts at the time hated Umbridge, but she particularly hated [[Harry Potter]], Fred, and George. When George and Harry attacked [[Draco Malfoy]], Umbridge kicked them off the team, along with Fred. They also created a [[Portable Swamp]], in order to anger Umbridge. When she attempted to punish them, Fred and George insulted her in front of the whole school and then fled with their broomsticks.



, his allies]]

In [[1995]], Fred and George joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation founded and led by [[Harry Potter]], in order to oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]] and teach [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] to the other students. The twins knew most of them, and they had a good relationship with most members of the army, including Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Lee and Angelina.

Some members of the army were also members of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], including [[Alicia Spinnet]] and [[Katie Bell]]. The girls appeared to be close with Fred, whom they possibly knew since their first year, as well as George. Both of them were very upset when Umbridge kicked Harry and the twins off the team. Fred met them again when they fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]].

Other members of the army were [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Padma and Parvati Patil|Parvati and Padma Patil]], [[Colin and Dennis Creevey]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Marietta Edgecombe]] and [[Zacharias Smith]]. Fred was friendly with them, although not very close; however, he disliked Zacharias Smith, who didn't believe that Voldemort had returned, and did not fight at the Battle of Hogwarts, as did Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the army to Umbridge. However, the rest of them fought for Dumbledore's Army, and at least two of them, Colin Creevey and Lavender Brown were killed by Death Eaters.





Fred and his brother [[George Weasley|George]] regarded the [[Marauders]] with a kind of idolatry and they believed that they owed a lot to them, as their invention, the [[Marauder's Map]], helped them to achieve a lot of their aims. Although they owned the map for many years, they did not refer to them as the Marauders, but instead they called them by their nicknames: [[Remus Lupin|Moony]], [[Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]], [[Sirius Black|Padfoot]], and [[James Potter I|Prongs]].

While they were in possession of the map, the twins did not, however, work out that two of the Marauders were two of their friends in the [[Order of the Phoenix]]: [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Sirius Black]]. Neither were they aware that Prongs was in fact [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s father, [[James Potter I|James]], and that Wormtail was actually [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Peter Pettigrew]].

He and George were both friends of Sirius Black. Sirius was friendly with them, but he argued with the twins (for example: when he told them to wait at home while their father was in danger). Sirius was killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in [[1996]]. The twins were saddened by his death, but tried not to remind Harry about it.

They were also friends of Remus Lupin, whom they first met in [[1993]], when he was [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor. They considered him among the best teachers of this lesson they had ever had. Lupin fought with the twins in many battles of the Second War, and was killed in the final battle, along with Fred. Their bodies were put near each other's in the [[Great Hall]].

It is unknown if the twins ever learnt the true identities of the Marauders, although it is possible they did eventually learn the truth after Voldemort's return considering that Sirius mentioned Pettigrew's nickname Wormtail in front of them while explaining Voldemort's intentions to them without them questioning that. It is also unknown if Lupin and Sirius ever learnt that the twins both had the Marauders Map in their possession during their time in Hogwarts.


, his alias]]

Fred also became a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. The Order was an organisation led by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in order to fight [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. Fred had a good relationship with most members of the order. Some notable relationships include Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, his other family members (excluding Percy who had fallen out with the other Weasleys, and Ginny who was underage) and some of the Hogwarts professors.

Another member of the Order that they knew was [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Tonks and the twins were close in age, and they were friendly. They fought together in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Tonks was killed during the battle, too. Her body was put near Fred's, as well as Lupin's, after their death.

The twins also knew [[Alastor Moody]] and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]. They appeared to have a good relationship, although they were not very close. When Moody was killed by Voldemort, everyone was sad. When the twins learned about it, they were joking with each other. They immediately stopped talking, and their expressions immediately switched to sadness. Kingsley survived the war and became Minister for Magic.

The name ''Fred'' is generally considered a short form of the name ''Frederick''. ''Alfred'', and ''Wilfred'', along with now being a name in its own right. ''Frederick'' is the English form of a Germanic name meaning 'peaceful ruler,' derived from ''frid'', 'peace,' and ''ric'', 'ruler, power.' It has been a very common name for rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia, such as [[Wikipedia:Frederick the Great|Frederick the Great]] of Prussia. Fred is also sometimes used as a diminutive of ''[[Wikipedia:Alfred (name)|Alfred]]'', derived from the Old English ''Ælfræd'', meaning 'elf counsel,' or ''Alfrid'', meaning 'old peace.' [[Wikipedia:Alfred the Great|Alfred the Great]] was a ninth-century king of Wessex who battled the Danes and translated many Latin books into Old English. In Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish, ''Fred'' means 'peace.'

There has been some suggestion that Fred and George are named after their maternal uncles, [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], who were killed in the [[First Wizarding War]], who may have been twins, and who share Fred and George's first initials.

Another possible significance of the twins' names is that George III became king because of the early death of Frederick, Prince of Wales. George III was also deaf in one ear. [[J. K. Rowling]] has stated that she chose the name for liking and and finding it fitting  with the 'old-fashioned' theme of the other Weasley brothers.

*Fred is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[James and Oliver Phelps|James Phelps]] in all eight [[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter film adaptations]] and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all of the films.
*In the films, Fred and George are nearly always seen side-by-side. For the viewer to distinguish between Fred and George, actor James Phelps(Fred) is always placed on the left side of the screen and Oliver Phelps(George) is always placed on the right side of the screen, similar to how they are called 'Fred and George'. 
*He and George may have been the basis for Kaoru and Hikaru Hitachiin from the shoujo manga, 'Ouran High School Host Club'. They are both a pair of red-haired, mischievous twins.
*[[Daniel Radcliffe]] plays Fred in the 'Seven Potters' scene in his capacity as a decoy Harry.
*Fred's last words were: 'You actually are joking, Perce — I don't think I've heard you joke since you were —'
*In the games, they used to own a shop in a deserted bathroom in Hogwarts, where they sold Wizard Cards, Chocolate Frogs, Cauldron Cakes and other magical items.
*Fred and George each earned fewer [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] than the rest of their brothers.
*Fred and George were the only sons of Arthur and Molly Weasley who did not become [[prefect]]s during their education at Hogwarts.
*When [[Harry Potter]] and his friends lost 150 [[House points]] in 1992, he lost favour with the Gryffindor Quidditch team. While understandable, it seems odd that Fred and George turned on him.
*In the novels, the twins are described as being 'shorter and stockier' and Percy and Ron as 'long and lanky,' but in the films, Fred and George are taller and leaner than both Percy and Ron.
*In her drawing of the [[Weasley family#Family Tree|Weasley family tree]], [[J. K. Rowling]] put the year of Fred's death down as 1997. In canon, he actually died in May 1998.
*His name was [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s last word, in the variation of 'Freddie.' In the last film this line was cut out and instead it is George who calls Fred 'Freddie' when asking if he was ready for battle. 

*Despite the fact that they only earned three O.W.L.s each, in , Fred mentioned that he was transfiguring a raccoon in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]]. In , George said that he might be able to sell a 'few Extendable ears before [[Herbology]]' and [[Lee Jordan]] said that Fred and George played [[Exploding Snap]] during [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], and that they had an inspected [[Charms (class)|Charms]] lesson.
*Fittingly, Fred and George are born on April Fools' Day.
*Fred and George might be named in honour of their mother's brothers Fabian and Gideon, as Fred and Fabian begin with the letter 'F', and George and Gideon begin with the letter 'G'.
*The only times Fred or George have been injured were when they were apart. They were split up at the time of Fred's death and when George lost his ear.
*In , it appears as though Fred is killed by a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] as the last moment seen of Fred is him scrambling on the floor with a Death Eater standing over him just as both start to cast a spell. However, due to the brevity of the scene, it escapes most people that the twin in this scene is George, not Fred. The twin in this scene is wearing a purple jacket, which is what George wears during the Battle of Hogwarts; Fred's jacket is green. Furthermore, the ear is also a clue, as it is mangled and has no earlobe. Fred's death is not seen on-screen much to the dismay of fans. It is not on the DVD version, or in the deleted scenes.
*The only time Fred saw George as old men, was when they put their names into the [[Goblet of Fire]].
*Oliver Phelps, who plays George, stated that it was quite upsetting for him to watch his real-life twin brother, James, act as if he were dead as Fred in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
*James Phelps admitted that when he was playing a dead Fred, he was actually asleep and the entire cast and crew went off to lunch without him, leaving him sleeping in the Great Hall set.


[[J. K. Rowling]] has commented that she always knew Fred was going to be killed in the series, though she guessed that readers would have expected George to die first, since he was the 'gentler' of the two: ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Fred is normally the funnier but also the crueller of the two. So they might have thought that George would be the more vulnerable one and, therefore, the one to die... Either one of them would have been terrible to kill. It was awful killing Fred. I hated that.<nowiki>'</nowiki>''

Rowling has also stated that Fred and George are among her favourite characters.
