{{Quote|Hagrid will be delighted. He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death.|[[Albus Dumbledore]] explaining Buckbeak's new name|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

'''Buckbeak''', 

He was later unfairly sentenced to death, when he attacked [[Draco Malfoy]] after being taunted and provoked. Buckbeak's death sentence was delivered from the [[Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures]]. Many of the members of this committee had been threatened by Draco's father, [[Lucius Malfoy]], into voting for that verdict.

With the help of [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]] and her [[Time-Turner]], Buckbeak escaped execution in 1994 and he came under the care of [[Sirius Black]]. Sirius kept Buckbeak with him while on the run during the 1994–1995 school year, and later kept him in his [[Walburga Black|mother]]'s bedroom while in hiding at [[12 Grimmauld Place]].

After Sirius's death, Buckbeak came to be owned by [[Harry Potter]] through Sirius's will, though Harry allowed him to live with Hagrid. He participated in two battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]], most notably the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. He also showed great affection and loyalty toward Harry,

==Biography==
===1993-1994 school year===
{{Quote|Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground.|Harry Potter riding Buckbeak in a third year Care of Magical Creatures class |Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}

[[File:HarryExtendsHandToBuckbeak HP.jpg|249x249px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter|Harry]] meets Buckbeak during his first Care of Magical Creatures lesson|alt=]]

In [[September]] [[1993]], [[Rubeus Hagrid]] brought his first [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class to see and study Buckbeak, as well as other hippogriffs. Under Hagrid's direction, Harry was able to successfully approach Buckbeak and was even allowed to ride him for a short flight around the paddock.

[[File:B3C16M2 Buckbeak's execution.png|251x251px|thumb|Buckbeak about to be unfairly executed by  [[Walden Macnair]]|alt=]]

As hippogriffs were immensely proud creatures, Buckbeak was offended when [[Draco Malfoy]] [[Hippogriff-baiting|taunted and provoked him]]. This resulted in him injuring the boy's arm.

[[File:B3C21M4 Sirius flying off on Buckbeak.png|250px|thumb|Harry and Hermione rescue Buckbeak and [[Sirius Black]]|alt=|left]]

However, using a [[Time-Turner]], Harry Potter and [[Hermione Granger]] [[Rescue of Sirius Black and Buckbeak|rescued]] Buckbeak just prior to the execution. Originally, they had heard the swish of an axe and assumed Buckbeak had been killed. Later, as it became evident that Buckbeak had escaped, Macnair was frustrated upon realising Buckbeak had gone, and was happily dismissed by [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. 

Hermione and Harry took Buckbeak into the [[Forbidden Forest]] with them to remain hidden from sight, and Hermione tied him to a tree to stop him escaping. As Hermione and Harry realised [[Remus Lupin]] in his [[werewolf]] was entering the forest, they went inside Hagrid's hut to hide. Hermione stayed in the hut with Buckbeak, who was very happy to be back home again. Harry then went off to the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]] to [[Attack at the Great Lake|fight]] the [[Dementor]]s with the [[Patronus Charm]], in order to save his past self and [[Sirius Black]]. 

After this, Hermione took Buckbeak with her to see what was going on in the forest. Buckbeak was then used to fly to [[Filius Flitwick]]'s [[Filius Flitwick's office|office]], in which Sirius was locked in, enabling Black to escape the Dementors and leave Hogwarts.

===Living with Sirius Black===
{{Quote| Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half grey horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak’s fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck.|The trio meeting Buckbeak in the Hogsmeade Cave|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[Sirius Black]] then took possession of Buckbeak while both were on the run from the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Buckbeak stayed in Sirius's late mother's room at [[12 Grimmauld Place]].

[[File:fugitives in the cave near Hogsmeade.png|250px|thumb|The trio visiting Sirius in the cave in which he's hiding with Buckbeak|alt=]]

On [[6 March]], [[1995]] Buckbeak appeared with Sirius in the [[Cave near Hogsmeade|cave]] near [[Hogsmeade]] when he came to talk to [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].

On [[18 June]], [[1996]], [[Kreacher]] injured Buckbeak with the encouragement of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy]] so that Sirius would be occupied with taking care of him when Harry tried to contact him. This led Harry to believe a false vision [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] showed him, where Sirius was being tortured in the [[Department of Mysteries]]. The scene lured Harry and his friends to the [[British Ministry of Magic Headquarters|Ministry]], and set the stage for a battle. During the battle Sirius died, knocked through the [[Veil]] in the [[Death Chamber]].

===Back in Hagrid's care===
{{Quote|Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him.|Buckbeak protecting Harry from [[Severus Snape]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

In [[July]] 1996, a month after Sirius' death, [[Albus Dumbledore]] told Harry that according to [[Sirius Black's will|Sirius' will]], he was now the legal owner of Buckbeak, though Harry told Dumbledore that Buckbeak could continue living with [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. 

In order to protect the hippogriff's identity, Buckbeak was renamed "Witherwings" at this time. He was greeted by Harry in front of Hagrid's hut when the trio dropped in for a visit. He was also present near the hut during [[Aragog's funeral]].

On [[30 June]], [[1997]], Buckbeak joined Harry's duel with [[Severus Snape]] across the grounds, attacking Snape and driving him off, thus protecting Harry. Buckbeak survived the battle and was still in very good health.

====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
{{Quote|Harry saw great winged creatures soaring the heads of Voldemort's giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummelling them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike were being forced back into the castle.|Buckbeak takes part in the second half of the final battle|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Hogwarts Big Battle at Hogwarts Moment Pottermore.jpg|245x245px|thumb|Buckbeak fighting a giant during the Battle of Hogwarts]]

During the Battle of Hogwarts, Buckbeak, along with several [[Thestral]]s, were seen attacking Lord Voldemort's [[giant]] soldiers from the air while [[Grawp]] was hitting them. Buckbeak survived the battle.

===Later life===
Buckbeak was still alive and well by [[2008]]. During a [[Christmas]] season at Hogwarts, he stayed with Hagrid, who invited students to ride him around the castle.

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Buckbeak Malfoy.png|thumb|Buckbeak attacks Malfoy]]
Buckbeak was a proud creature and at first he seemed to be fairly aggressive, attacking [[Draco Malfoy]] when the latter insulted him. Despite his earlier signs of aggression, Buckbeak has been shown to be very loyal and protective of those who treat him with kindness and respect.

Buckbeak was intelligent in his ability to recognise his past acquaintances, as he defended a cornered Harry from [[Severus Snape]] in [[1997]]. His loyalty towards Harry was undying, and further proven when he joined the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]] to fight.

*Buckbeak's role in the series beyond the ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' was omitted from the films, though concept art of the character was made for {{DH|F2}} and he appeared in {{LEGO|Y2}}.
*The [[wizard rock]] band [[Draco and the Malfoys]] have a song titled ''Hippogriffs Deserve to Die'', all about Draco being attacked by Buckbeak.
*The [[Flight of the Hippogriff]] ride at {{WWHP}} has an animatronic version of Buckbeak, resting in a nest.
*In the book of {{POA}}, Harry doesn't exactly enjoy his first ride on Buckbeak, and it's made clear between [[hippogriff]]s and [[broomstick]]s which one he prefers. However, in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|film adaptation]], during his first ride on Buckbeak, Harry appears to be fascinated by the ride and enjoys it immensely as they fly over the Black Lake, raising his arms and shouting in triumph. The film portrayal also depicts a much longer ride, with Buckbeak achieving a sort of smooth, idyllic glide not described in the novel.
*Buckbeak also defecated in the film version; it happens right after Ron urges Harry to go up to Buckbeak. The CGI team believed this was the first time an animal was animated doing this, but ''Walking With Dinosaurs'' did it first in 1999.
*Concept artist Dermot Power wanted to portray Buckbeak as a "noble beast" with "romantic magic potential", but director [[Alfonso Cuarón]] disapproved of these designs.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|video game]] of {{POA}}, Ron is inexplicably unable to ride Buckbeak unlike Harry and Hermione. If the player attempts to ride Buckbeak as Ron, he will knock him back and caw at him. This could be because Ron never rides Buckbeak in any of the books or films.
