'''Frank C. J. Longbottom''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], an [[Auror]] for the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] during [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s first rise to power. He was the son of [[Augusta Longbottom]] and the husband of Auror [[Alice Longbottom]]. 
Frank and his wife were original members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and fought against [[Death Eaters]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]. 

At the end of the war in 1981, when their son [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] was only an infant, he and his wife were [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] into [[insanity]] by four Death Eaters. He and his wife were subsequently placed in the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] for irrevocable spell damage at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Frank was born to [[Frank Longbottom's father|Mr Longbottom]] and his wife [[Augusta Longbottom|Augusta]]. He may have attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

Ultimately, Frank became a well-respected [[Auror]], as did his wife, [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]]. At the time [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]] were growing increasingly powerful, Alice and Frank joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]] to oppose them.

===First Wizarding War {{c|1970s-1981}}===
{{Quote|The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches...Born to those to have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies...and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives...The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.|[[Sybill Trelawney]]'s first Prophecy|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250x250px|thumb|left|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]

Frank and Alice welcomed their only child, [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]], on [[30 July]] [[1980]]. Shortly after being born, Neville managed to [[underage magic|magically adjust]] his blankets so that they were wrapped more tightly around him, but no one witnessed this remarkable feat. The [[Alice Longbottom's midwife|midwife]] who attended the birth assumed that Frank had tucked the newborn boy in more snugly.

As Aurors and Order members, Frank and Alice earned the wrath of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] by virtue of them being very efficient. They were responsible for a lot of captures, arrests, and imprisonments of his [[Death Eaters]] throughout the [[First Wizarding War]] Frank and Alice would ultimately defy him three times. 

The latter made their son, [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]], one of the two young infants who was the possible subject of a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] made by [[Sybill Trelawney]] about the person who could defeat the Dark Lord. The other infant was [[Harry Potter]], son of Order members [[James and Lily Potter]]. Trelawney's prediction was overheard by [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Severus Snape]], who informed Voldemort.

The Dark Lord targeted Harry, because he was also a [[half-blood]], and was defeated for the first time on [[31 October]], [[1981]]. It is not known if the Longbottoms were told about the prophecy, as it is not known whether they disappeared into hiding, nor whether they undertook any action to prevent the Death Eaters from harming the family after Voldemort's fall.

Shortly afterward, Alice and Frank were attacked by Death Eaters Bellatrix, [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]] and [[Rabastan Lestrange]], and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Bartemius Crouch Jnr]]. They were captured and tortured extensively with the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. Although the Death Eaters were caught and sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]] for their crimes, their victims would never recover. 

[[File:B5C23M1 Christmas at St Mungo's.png|250px|thumb|left|Augusta and Neville visiting Frank and Alice]]

Frank was deemed insane, and lost his capability to function in society. He and Alice were placed in the permanent ward of [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], where they would reside for the rest of their lives, not even being able to recognise their son.

Because of Frank and Alice's inability to care for their son, Neville was raised in the care of his grandmother, [[Augusta Longbottom]], Frank's mother. Neville regularly visits his parents for Christmas and other holidays, although they do not overtly recognise Neville on these visits. 

Neville was taunted about his parents' state by one of their attackers, Bellatrix Lestrange, during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. Neville witnessed the death of Bellatrix at [[Molly Weasley]]'s hands during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b|Bellatrix Lestrange|Neville Longbottom, is it? How's mum and dad?|Neville Longbottom|Better now that they're about to be avenged!|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]] taunting Neville in [[1996]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)}}Frank was a well-respected Auror and member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. It is said that he and his wife were very beloved among the wizarding world. After they were tortured into insanity, he couldn't recognise his son, but Neville still loved them.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': In addition to being a highly talented [[Auror]], implying that he achieved the necessary grades in his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] and [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]], Frank was a valued member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and a highly competent wizard. He successfully defied [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] on three separate occasions and survived the actual [[First Wizarding War|war]] unscathed, only afterwards was he subjected to horrendous torture by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and her cohorts.
*'''[[Auror]] skills''': As an official Dark Wizard catcher, Frank Longbottom was an accomplished and skilful wizard. Along with his wife and fellow Auror [[Alastor Moody]], he successfully rounded up many of the Dark Lord's followers throughout the latter's first rise to power. Despite his considerable ability, however, he was unable to fight off the group of some of the fiercest supporters of Lord Voldemort that targeted him and his wife shortly after Lord Voldemort's disappearance, and were captured by them and subsequently tortured to insanity by [[Death Eaters]] looking for information about the whereabouts of their fallen leader, namely [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]] and [[Rabastan Lestrange]], along with [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]].

==Relationships==
===Family===
[[File:Longbottom family portrait.png|245px|thumb|Frank with his wife and infant son]]

Frank and his wife were Aurors and members of the first [[Order of the Phoenix]]. They had a son named [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] together. When Neville was only a year old, Frank and Alice were tortured to insanity by four [[Death Eaters]]. The Death Eaters were imprisoned for life in [[Azkaban]], but Frank and Alice required permanent care at St Mungo's.

Neville was very sad about his parents, and visited them in the hospital, although they could not recognise him, he was also "quite proud" to be their son as he told Harry Potter in 1995. [[Augusta Longbottom]], Frank's mother, was also very sad. She too had a high opinion of them and was very proud when her grandson fought in several battles, like his parents, she even stated that he was finally starting to "''live up to his father at last.''"

===Order of the Phoenix===
Other members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] appeared to have had a good relationship with Frank and Alice during the [[First Wizarding War]]. Some of them, such as [[Alastor Moody]], were very sad that the Longbottoms were tortured into insanity. Moody also stated that the Longbottoms would have preferred to die than live in insanity.

==Etymology==
*Frank is an English word meaning free or truthful.
*His name could also be from Frank Sidebottom.
*The Franks were a Germanic tribe that settled in France and the Netherlands. The name is derived from a word meaning "spear."

==Behind the scenes==
*Frank Longbottom was briefly portrayed by [[James Payton]] in {{OOTP|FA}}.
