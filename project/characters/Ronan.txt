'''Ronan''' was a male [[centaur]] who lived in the [[Forbidden Forest]].

==Biography==
On the night of [[26 May]] [[1992]], Ronan along with fellow centaur [[Bane]] met [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in the Forbidden Forest, who was investigating that night why [[unicorn]]s in the forest were being slaughtered, although the two centaurs could not explain why and thus were unable to help him.

He was distrustful of [[human]]s, although he tried to protect [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] from the other centaurs in [[1996]], pointing out that they were "foals", during the [[Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest]] involving [[Dolores Umbridge]]. He was described as speaking with a doleful tone, and seemed rather peaceful compared to other centaurs.

He led the charge of the centaurs from the [[Forbidden Forest]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], breaking through the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] ranks into the [[Great Hall]]. It is likely that he witnessed the final battle between [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and Harry Potter.

==Physical description==
He was described as having red hair, and a red beard. Below the waist, he had a [[horse]]'s gleaming chestnut body with a long and reddish tail.

==Etymology==
'''Rónán''' (anglicized '''Ronan''') is an Irish male given name meaning "little seal", ''Rón'' meaning "seal", and -''án'' being a diminutive suffix in Irish Gaelic).

==Behind the scenes==
*Ronan is the first [[Centaur]] introduced in the [[Wizarding World (franchise)|Wizarding World franchise]], appearing shortly before [[Bane]] in {{PS}}.
