'''Gibbon''' (d. [[30 June]], [[1997]]) was a [[Dark Wizard]] and one of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s loyal [[Death Eaters]]. He fought in the [[Second Wizarding War]], including the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] in 1997. During the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Gibbon [[Morsmordre|set]] the [[Dark Mark]] above the [[Astronomy Tower]]. He was accidentally killed by fellow Death Eater [[Thorfinn Rowle]], when he was hit by a stray [[Killing Curse]].



Gibbon was an active [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. It is unknown if he also took part in the [[First Wizarding War]] or whether or not he was sent to [[Azkaban]] following [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s original downfall.


On [[30 June]] [[1997]], Gibbon fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, along with fellow Death Eaters [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]], [[Corban Yaxley]], [[Thorfinn Rowle]], [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Severus Snape]], and [[Fenrir Greyback]]. Gibbon was the Death Eater who set the Dark Mark above the Astronomy Tower. It is supposed that he did not like the idea of staying at the tower and waiting for [[Albus Dumbledore]] alone, so he ran downstairs. He died shortly afterwards, when a stray [[Killing Curse]] cast by [[Thorfinn Rowle]] that missed [[Remus Lupin]] struck Gibbon instead. It is unknown what happened to his body after the battle.


Almost nothing is known about Gibbon's exact personality, except the fact that he feared Albus Dumbledore and that he did not want to stay at the Astronomy Tower and wait for him alone.


*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, Gibbon would have been proficient in dark magic, including the casting of [[Dark charm]]s and likely the [[Unforgivable Curses]]. Gibbon was capable of [[Morsmordre|creating]] the [[Dark Mark]] above Hogwarts, during a battle, something that only a skilled and experienced dark wizard could create, according to [[Arthur Weasley]].
*'''[[Duelling]]''': As a Death Eater, he was a competent and experienced duellist, as he fought against the Order of the Phoenix and escaping in order to go to the [[Astronomy Tower]], meaning he had some skill in [[martial magic]].


A "gibbon" is a type of primate. Gibbon is also a 15th century diminuative form of Gilbert. See [[Gilbert Wimple]] and [[Eleanor Sarah Gibbs]] for further details.


*During the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] he was recognised by [[Remus Lupin]], suggesting that the two have encountered each other in the past, or at least that he was a known Death Eater to the Order prior to the battle.
*In , the Battle of the Astronomy Tower did not take place, meaning Gibbon was not killed by a stray Killing Curse.
