'''Graham Montague'''





1993-1994 Quidditch season
While it is uncertain whether Montague was on the Slytherin Quidditch team prior, Montague played in the final match between Slytherin and [[Gryffindor]] in [[1994]]. When Gryffindor Chaser [[Katie Bell]] got possession of the [[Quaffle]], Montague flew in front of her, but, instead of taking the ball, he grabbed her head. Although Katie was able to keep from falling off her [[broomstick|broom]], she dropped the Quaffle. [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] scolded Montague and awarded a penalty to Katie.

1995-1996 Quidditch season
At the beginning of the [[1995–1996 school year|1995-1996]] [[Quidditch]] season, Montague was made [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the Slytherin Quidditch team, replacing [[Marcus Flint]]. He chose [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] to be the team's new [[Beater]]s.


Montague joined the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] in April of 1996. During morning break on his first day as a member, he tried to take [[House points]] from [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], but the twins shoved him into the [[Vanishing Cabinet]] before he could finish speaking. While trapped inside, Montague could occasionally hear goings-on at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], as well as at [[Borgin and Burkes]], where the Cabinet's counterpart was located. He managed to [[Apparition|Apparate]] out the next day, despite never having obtained an [[Apparition (class)|Apparition licence]], but ended up lodged inside a toilet in the [[fourth-floor bathroom]].

 and [[George Weasley]] push Montague head-first into the Vanishing Cabinet|alt]]
The Apparition nearly proved fatal to Montague. In May, his parents, [[Graham Montague's parents|Mr and Mrs Montague]], came to the school, looking furious. [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] watched the couple arrive, and Hermione suggested that they should tell [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] what had happened in case it would help her treat him. However, both Ron and Harry dismissed this idea, so Hermione apparently let the matter drop. Several weeks later, during the [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exams in June, Harry went to the [[Hospital Wing]], where he saw Madam Pomfrey spoon-feeding a [[Bright blue liquid|vivid blue potion]] to Montague.

Montague eventually told his story to others, including [[Draco Malfoy]], who was the only one to reach the conclusion that there was a connection between the Cabinet at Hogwarts and the Cabinet at [[Borgin and Burkes]]. This knowledge gave Draco the means to allow [[Death Eaters]] to enter the school the following year.


Montague was described as being large and muscular, even more so than Crabbe and Goyle. He was also described as having hairy arms.


Being the [[Captain]] and [[Chaser]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], he was presumably rather ambitious and determined, being a member of [[Slytherin]]. He was most likely rather mean-spirited, having became a member of the short-lived [[Inquisitorial Squad]], which persecuted [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]] and [[Ravenclaw]] students for petty and spiteful reasons.  

He once tried to deduct house points from [[Fred and George Weasley]] with ill-intent, which proved to be his downfall considering what they did to him as a result. He also showed poor sportsmanship whilst playing [[Quidditch]], being inclined to commit fouls when he grabbed [[Katie Bell]]'s head during the [[1993–1994 school year]] Quidditch season and being penalised by [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] as punishment. 


*'''[[Apparition]]''': Montague was capable of apparating, despite not having not received his formal [[Apparition (class)|Apparition licence]], as he somehow managed to apparate out the [[Vanishing Cabinet]] that [[Fred and George Weasley]] shoved and trapped him inside one, quite an impressive [[magic]]al feat. 
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Having been both the [[Captain]] and [[Chaser]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] whilst as a Hogwarts student, Montague was obviously a very accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, despite his unsporting behaviour displayed on the Quidditch pitch. 


The name "Graham" is from a Scottish surname which was originally derived from an English place name which probably meant "gravelly homestead" in Old English. The surname was first taken to Scotland in the 12th century by the Norman baron William de Graham. Montague is also the surname of Romeo in Shakespeare's famous play ''Romeo and Juliet.''


*This character is known only by his surname in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|Harry Potter books]]. His first name is given in the  video game, making him one of two [[Slytherin]]s named Graham, the other being [[Graham Pritchard]].
