'''Cadwallader''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]] [[Hogwarts Houses|house]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He played the position of [[Chaser]] for his house [[Quidditch]] [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team|team]].


In [[1996]], during a match against the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]], commentator [[Luna Lovegood]] could not remember Cadwallader's name, calling him "Bibble" and "Buggins" before [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] corrected her.


*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Cadwallader was evidently a skilled [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, given how he was chosen to play the position of [[Chaser]] for the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team]].


*The [[password]] to the [[portrait]] of [[Bertie Bott]], guarding a secret room, was ''Bibble''.
*The name of the seeker in the Welsh Quidditch team during the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]] is said to be [[Eurig Cadwallader]] in [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]]'s daily prophet commentary of the game [[Wales]] against [[Germany]]. It is possible Cadwallader is this very same Eurig Cadwallader, given their similarities in age and surname, and the fact that Hogwarts students come only from Britain, with Wales being in Britain. It is also possible that Eurig Cadwallader and this Cadwallader are relatives.


*Cadwallader is the name of the heraldic red Welsh dragon, as well as that of a Welsh king who declared it his mission to exterminate the English.
*Cadwallader is also used as the alias for the devil in disguise on Escape Clause, the sixth episode of American TV Series The Twilight Zone.
