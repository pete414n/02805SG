'''Cassius''' '''Warrington''' (likely born between [[1 September]] and [[31 October]] [[1977]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Slytherin]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was named as a [[Chaser]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] in the [[1993–1994 school year]]. He may have later attempted to participate in the [[Triwizard Tournament]] in [[1994]] and became a member of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] in [[1995]].



Cassius Warrington was likely born between [[1 September]] and [[31 October]] [[1977]] and came to be educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1989]]. The [[Sorting Hat]] placed him in [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] during the [[Sorting ceremony]] and his [[Head of House]] was [[Professor]] [[Severus Snape]], the [[Potions Master]].


In [[1993]], Warrington replaced [[Adrian Pucey]] as [[Chaser]] on the [[Slytherin]] [[Quidditch]] [[Slytherin Quidditch team|team]] with [[Marcus Flint]] as the [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Quidditch Captain]]. [[Lee Jordan]], the Commentator at the time, said that Flint was "''going for size rather than skill''" in the lineup in reference to Warrington. On the last day of the season, Slytherin lost to the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] during the re-scheduled match, and thus Gryffindor won the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]]. Also that same year, Warrington presumably sat his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] under the [[Wizarding Examinations Authority]].


In [[1994]], [[Quidditch]] was cancelled due to the [[Triwizard Tournament]] being held in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. When [[Albus Dumbledore]] placed the [[Goblet of Fire]] in the [[Great Hall]] in order for students to try to compete, Warrington was rumoured to have put his in. If so, it was for naught, as [[Cedric Diggory]] was chosen over him.


]]During [[1995–1996 school year|this school year]], Warrington played [[Quidditch]] on the [[Slytherin]] team against [[Gryffindor]] and scored against the new Gryffindor keeper, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], who was still trying to get his confidence.
This same year, [[Dolores Umbridge]] became the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[Professor]] and later [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor of Hogwarts]]. 

As High Inquisitor, Umbridge formed the [[Inquisitorial Squad]], of which Warrington was a member, who were given the power to dock [[House points]] from all students, including [[Prefect]]s. [[Inquisitorial Squad|The squad]] had a hard time keeping order though, as many of them came down with weird ailments. Warrington, for instance, reported to the [[Hospital Wing]] with a [[Cornflake skin spell|horrible skin complaint]] that made him look as though he had been coated in [[cornflakes]].

When [[Harry Potter]] tried to contact [[Sirius Black]], he had several students create diversions. Warrington and several others tried to catch students, and Warrington caught [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] and [[Neville Longbottom]]. However, the [[Dumbledore's Army]] members managed to overpower the squad once Umbridge, Hermione and Harry had left, having attacked them with many well placed [[jinx]]es, [[hex]]es and [[curse]]s, such as [[Ginevra Weasley]]'s impressive [[Bat-Bogey Hex]]; as such, he was likely injured after this event. At the end of the year, [[Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]] left and the [[Inquisitorial Squad|Squad]] was disbanded.


Having been a member of the short-lived [[Inquisitorial Squad]] during the [[1995–1996 school year]], Warrington was presumably rather mean-spirited and power-hungry, given how the squad was notorious for harassing students for minor or non-existent infractions and for deducting House points from [[Gryffindor]]s, [[Hufflepuff]]s and [[Ravenclaw]]s for petty and spiteful reasons. He was also however rather ambitious, being a member of [[Slytherin]] house, as he was rumoured to have placed his name in the [[Triwizard Cup]] in [[1994]] and also played for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]. 


*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Warrington was chosen as [[Chaser]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] in [[1993]], meaning he was evidently an accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, so much so that the team considered him good enough to replace [[Adrian Pucey]].

*He may be related to [[Ivy Warrington|Ivy]] and [[Winifred Warrington]].
