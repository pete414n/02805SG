She was interrogated by [[Dolores Umbridge]] and [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]], and would have been convicted and sent to [[Azkaban]] if not for the help of Harry and Hermione (disguised as [[Albert Runcorn]] and [[Mafalda Hopkirk]] respectively). Harry, Hermione and Ron (disguised as her husband Reginald Cattermole) assisted her and a group of Muggle-borns who had been in for questioning escape the Ministry.

"Mary" is the English form of Maria, which was the Latin form of the New Testament Greek names Μαριαμ (''Mariam'') and Μαρια (''Maria'') (the spellings are interchangeable) which in turn come from the Hebrew name מִרְיָם (''Miryam''). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", and "wished for child". It is also possible that the source of the name lies in ancient Egyptian, and was derived from ''mry'' "beloved" or ''mr'' "love".
