'''Theodore Nott''' (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was a [[Slytherin]] student in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He came from a [[Nott family|family]] of [[Death Eaters]] and supporters of [[Pure-blood supremacy]].

==Biography==
===Early life {{c|1980-1991}}===
Theodore Nott was born to an elderly [[Wizardkind|wizard]], [[Nott|Mr Nott]] and [[Theodore Nott's mother|his wife]]. After the death of his mother, Theodore was raised by his father, who was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]].

===Hogwarts years {{c|1991-1998}}===
====First year====
Theodore started at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September]] [[1991]], and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] house.

====Fifth year====
During a [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lesson in his [[fifth year]], he was one of only three students present who could see [[Thestral]]s. This suggests that he may have witnessed his mother's [[death]] firsthand. He found the [[creature]]s rather distasteful and unpleasant as he watched one eating.

[[Hermione Granger]] pointed out Theodore's name to [[Harry Potter]] for the first time in [[1996]]. She did this when Theodore was gathered in the school library with fellow Slytherins: [[Vincent Crabbe]], [[Gregory Goyle]], and [[Draco Malfoy]]. All four boys had fathers who had recently been outed by Harry as Death Eaters in an article published in ''[[The Quibbler]]''. Theodore was the only member of the group whose reaction to seeing Harry was not specifically noted as being either negative or threatening, as it was not noticeable at all.

At the end of the year, Theodore's father was captured in the Department of Mysteries as one of the Death Eaters who participated in the raid on the Department and exposed as an escaped Death Eater. With his father incarcerated and his mother dead, it is unspecified who cared for Theodore Nott during the school holidays.

====[[Sixth year]]====
{{Quote|I wouldn't bank on an invitation.  He asked me about Nott's father when I first arrived. They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he heard he'd been caught at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] he didn't look happy, and Nott didn't get an invitation, did he?|Discussion of Slug Club invites|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince#The Slug Club}}[[File:Slughorn pottermore.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Theodore and twelve other students in N.E.W.T.-level potions class]]

While on the [[Hogwarts Express]] in [[1996]], [[Horace Slughorn]] waylaid [[Blaise Zabini]] and inquired after Theodore's father. Blaise replied that [[Nott|Mr Nott]] was a Death Eater imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for breaking into the [[Department of Mysteries]] the previous June. Slughorn, not wanting any association with Death Eaters, was not pleased and thus invited Blaise, not Theodore, to join the [[Slug Club]].

Theodore was one of four Slytherin students who progressed to the [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level in [[Potions (class)|Potions]]. During his first lesson with Professor Slughorn, he sat next to Draco, and they both sniggered when Hermione revealed that she was a [[Muggle-born]]. They also were sceptical about the effects of [[Amortentia]].

====[[Seventh year]]====
Theodore attended his seventh year at Hogwarts. Due to being a [[pure-blood]] [[Slytherin]], as well as the son of a Death Eater, he was likely treated better than most. Shortly before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], students were being evacuated from the school including the Slytherins. It is unknown if he was one of the few students to join [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], or if he simply joined those who evacuated.

===Later life===
{{Dialogue|Hermione Granger|Theodore Nott?|Harry Potter|In custody.|Harry arrested Nott for having an illegal Time-Turner|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child}}
In [[2020]] Nott duelled [[Harry Potter]] (the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]) and was defeated and then arrested by him. He was arrested for the illegal possession of an unregistered and advanced [[Time-Turner]].

Nott had created at least two Time-Turners for [[Lucius Malfoy]]. The prototype, which was restricted by a boundary of five minutes, was seized by Potter and used by his [[Albus Potter|son]] to travel to the past. The improved Time-Turner, which gleamed gold and allowed the traveller to stay in the past for an unlimited time, was kept by Lucius who never used it. Draco Malfoy then used it to save his [[Scorpius Malfoy|son]] in the past.

==Physical description==
Theodore was "weedy" and "stringy," indicating that he was tall, thin, and perhaps weakly built. He was also considered to be "[[rabbit]]y" in appearance by some.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them snickered.|Nott and [[Draco Malfoy]] insulting Hermione's [[Muggle-born]] status|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Theodore was a solitary boy who never felt compelled to join "gangs," such as the [[Draco Malfoy's gang|one]] headed by Draco Malfoy. He was seen as a loner who preferred to do things by himself, although he did join in when Malfoy laughed at [[Hermione Granger]]'s [[Blood status|status]] as a [[Muggle-born]], which suggests he was a [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] like Malfoy and their fathers.

Theodore was particularly clever and inventive, best demonstrated by his cunning and secretive creation of two illegal [[Time-Turner]]s, a spectacular feat not many others, including many British Ministry of Magic officials, were capable of doing.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Theodore was evidently skilled at potion-making, as he was only one of twelve students able to advance to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level [[Potions (class)|Potions]] in [[1996]]. He either achieved an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' or an '[[Outstanding]]' on his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam, showing his proficiency in the subject.
*'''[[Magic]]al device invention''': He was skilled in creating magical devices. He successfully created two [[Time-Turner]]s that allow the user to travel far back into time, surpassing the [[Hour-Reversal Charm]] on the Ministry-issued devices.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Theodore had some degree of skill in duelling other wizards, as he duelled [[Harry Potter]] in [[2020]], although he was defeated by the far superior duellist and arrested, meaning his combative abilities were hardly exceptional.

==Possessions==
*'''Two [[Time-Turner#True Time-Turners|Time-Turners]]''': Theodore created two Time-Turners while working for [[Lucius Malfoy]], that had not been registered nor approved by the [[Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. Nott kept the prototype, which was made of inexpensive metal. The time-turner allowed the traveller to travel as far back as they wanted in [[time]], but stay in the past for five-minutes before returning to the present.

==Etymology==
{{w|Theodore (given name)|Theodore}} is an English name that comes from the Greek name ''Theodοros'', which is derived from the words ''theos'', meaning "God", and ''dōron'', meaning "gift". Thus, it is often considered to mean "gift of God". It was the name of many early Christian saints. The Welsh version of the name, ''Tewdwr'', was anglicised to {{w|Tudor}}, the name of a royal dynasty of England that ended with [[Elizabeth I]]. It could imply that Theodore was "God's gift" to his parents, if the version of his mother being an older woman are true and she was already out of age to get pregnant.

In Norse mythology, {{w|Nótt}} is the personification of night. Also, {{w|Josiah C. Nott}} was a nineteenth century American physician who advocated and popularised polygenist theories about the inherent superiority of Caucasians.

==Behind the scenes==
*Rowling created a subplot which was eventually cut from the series storyline, where Theodore and [[Draco Malfoy]] were talking in the garden of [[Malfoy Manor]], which would have been one of the few times that Draco would be seen conversing with someone he regarded as an equal, as Rowling said that Theodore was just as [[pure-blood]]ed as him. Rowling stated that she liked the scene so much that she tried to use it twice: first in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]]'' and second in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]''.
*Rowling states that she knows much more about Nott than what is revealed in the books, and expresses a similar sentiment in regards to [[Dean Thomas]].
*It is possible that Theodore Nott was portrayed by Elliot Francis, who played an unidentified boy at Slughorn's dinner party. Like Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) and Robert Knox (Marcus Belby), he was not seen as a guest at the christmas party again. In the book, all three of them (Neville, Marcus and Theodore) were not invited by Slughorn for Christmas.
*Some fans assumed that the character [[Pike]] was Theodore Nott in {{POA|FA}}.
