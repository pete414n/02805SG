'''Terence Higgs''' (b. [[1970s]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a [[Slytherin]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].


He was the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] [[Seeker]] during the [[1991–1992 school year|1991–1992]] season and in the first game of the year, raced [[Harry Potter]] for the [[Golden Snitch]]. 

But in the [[1992–1993 school year]], he was replaced by [[Draco Malfoy]].  However, it is unknown if he was still attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] at that time, or if he had already graduated.


Like [[Adrian Pucey]], he appeared to be one of the more decent Slytherin players, as he seemed to play by the rules of Quidditch and did not resort to cheating.


*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': As the [[Seeker]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], Higgs was evidently a talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, as he was deemed good enough to be Seeker for the team.


*Terence Higgs was portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[Will Theakston]], with the credits incorrectly stating he was played by [[Scot Fearn]]. Fearn's name was also misspelled as Fern.
*In  Terence Higgs used the [[cobbing]] foul against [[Harry Potter]], although he could have done it simply in retaliation, since Harry cobbed him first. It is unclear if this was the case, as Terence ended up cobbing Harry four times as opposed to twice.


Terentius was a Roman family name. It may mean "tender" or "gracious". Higgs is variation of Hicks, from old English Hicke, a nickname for the Norman French name Richard. The early English substituted an "H" because they had trouble saying the letter "R".
