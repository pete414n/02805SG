'''Mrs Mason''' was the  wife of [[Mason|Mr Mason]],


On [[31 July]], [[1992]], the couple were dinner guests at the [[4 Privet Drive|Dursley home]]. Their evening was nearly ruined when the dessert [[Petunia Dursley]] had made crashed to the floor (an incident blamed on [[Harry Potter]] though it was [[Dobby]]'s fault), which they were extremely shocked at. The evening could have been rescued were it not for the barn [[owl]], that flew through the open window to deliver a letter of warning of a breach of the [[Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]] for Harry. The owl dropped the letter on Mrs Mason's head, and due to her extreme fear of [[bird]]s, she “screamed like a [[banshee]]” and ran from the house shouting something about lunatics, followed quickly by her husband.
