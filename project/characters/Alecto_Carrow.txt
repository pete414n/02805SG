{{Quote|Alecto, Amycus's sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We've all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drive wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being re-established.|Alecto's prejudiced and hateful teachings|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
'''Professor Alecto Carrow''' was a [[Dark Wizard|Dark witch]], [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and the sister of [[Amycus Carrow]]. Alecto fought in the [[First Wizarding War]] along with her brother. They did not search for [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] after his first downfall, but were forgiven after Voldemort's [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] in [[1995|1995,]] and joined the Death Eater ranks once more in the [[Second Wizarding War]]. 

After the [[fall of the Ministry of Magic]] in [[1997]], Alecto was made Professor of [[Muggle Studies]]; she taught the thinking that [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s are lesser than [[Wizardkind]], and likely taught the [[Pure-blood|pureblood]]-philosophy as well. When [[Severus Snape]] became [[Headmaster]] of Hogwarts, she was appointed as [[Headmaster|Deputy Headmistress]], alongside her brother (who was appointed as [[Deputy Headmaster]]). She loved to punish and torture the students who opposed them. 

On the eve of [[1 May]] [[1998]], shortly before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], she was [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by [[Luna Lovegood]] when she summoned [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]]. She was then magically tied up in [[Ravenclaw Tower]] by [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. After the battle, she was likely sent to [[Azkaban]] along with her brother for their crimes. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Alecto Carrow was born sometime before [[1981]]<ref name="born" /> into the [[pure-blood]] [[Carrow family]] somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]]. She likely acquired her [[Alecto Carrow's wand|wand]] at either [[Ollivanders|Ollivander's Wand Shop]] in [[Diagon Alley]] or [[Wands by Gregorovitch]] at the [[Carkitt Market]].<ref name="DH30" />

Alecto attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in her youth along with her brother, and was a member of [[Slytherin]] house.<ref name="LEGOY2">{{LEGO|Y2}}</ref>

===First Wizarding War===
[[File:Alecto Carrow wanted poster.png|250px|thumb|left|A wanted poster of Alecto Carrow]]
Alecto and her brother, [[Amycus Carrow|Amycus]], supported [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and became [[Death Eaters]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]. After [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|Voldemort's downfall]] in [[1981]], they did not search for their master, believing that Voldemort was gone forever, and thus avoided imprisonment in [[Azkaban]].<ref name="HBP2" /><ref name="carrowsjkr">[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=62 "Are Alecto and Amycus (the two sibling Death Eaters) the Carrows mentioned by Snape in Spinner's End?"] on {{JKRS}}</ref>

Despite this, Alecto and Amycus were among those who, after [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]], resumed their [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] activities.<ref name="HBP2">{{HBP|B|2}}</ref> The two siblings were fairly active during the [[Second Wizarding War]].<ref name="HBP27" /><ref name="DH30" />

===Second Wizarding War===
====[[Return of Lord Voldemort|Rebirth of the Dark Lord]]====
Alecto and her brother were, most likely, among the [[Death Eaters]] that were summoned by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] to the [[Little Hangleton graveyard|churchyard]] at [[Little Hangleton]] on [[24 June]] [[1995]], as their absence wasn't noted by Voldemort himself.<ref name="GF33">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref> However he did not speak to either of them, if they were there.

====Battle of the Astronomy Tower====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Albus Dumbledore|Good evening, Amycus. And you've brought Alecto too... charming...|Alecto Carrow|Think your little jokes'll help you on your death bed, then?|Jokes? No, no, these are manners.|[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] greeting the Carrows at the Astronomy Tower|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Death Eaters Astronomy Tower.jpg|250px|thumb|Alecto and her brother among other Death Eaters atop the Astronomy Tower]]
On the evening of [[30 June]] [[1997]], Alecto and her brother participated in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower|assault]] on [[Hogwarts Castle]], orchestrated by [[Draco Malfoy]], that resulted in the death of [[Albus Dumbledore]]. When the [[Death Eaters]] arrived at the top of the [[Astronomy Tower]], where Dumbledore was trapped, Alecto gave "wheezing giggles", as her brother mocked the [[Headmaster]]. When [[Severus Snape]] arrived on the scene, he cast the Killing Curse that ended the Headmaster's life.<ref name="HBP27" />

On Snape's orders, she and her brother swiftly left the Tower, panting excitedly. In the corridors below, Alecto and Amycus retreated after Snape with their arms over their heads, under attack from blasts by [[Minerva McGonagall]]. As the brother and sister descended the [[Marble Staircase]], [[Harry Potter|Harry]] took a shortcut and arrived on the grounds before them.<ref name="HBP28">{{HBP|B|28}}</ref>

As the two Death Eaters closed in after him, one of them cast a spell that sent Harry to the ground. Harry hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other, with another [[Impediment Jinx]]. Alecto and her brother recovered shortly after and were ordered along by Snape to leave Harry. The two siblings then ran to the gates along with [[Thorfinn Rowle]], and [[Apparition|Disapparated]] beyond the school boundaries.<ref name="HBP28" />

[[File:Malfoy Manor meeting.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Alecto being present at the Death Eater meeting held in Malfoy Manor]]
That summer the Carrows attended a Death Eater [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor|meeting]] at [[Malfoy Manor]]. This meeting concerned [[Battle of the Seven Potters|plans to capture or kill Harry Potter]] and take over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="DHpt1">{{DH|F1}}</ref> During this meeting it was revealed that the Death Eaters had successfully infiltrated the Ministry and that they were aware of the date in which Harry would be removed from Privet Drive. This meeting took place during the height of the Second Wizarding War. 

====Appointment at Hogwarts====
{{Quote|The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don't, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do... I got this one for asking ''[Alecto]'' how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.|[[Neville Longbottom]] regarding his recently acquired scars|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:AlectoSnapeAmycus.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Headmaster Severus Snape with Deputy Heads Alecto (left) and Amycus Carrow (right)]]
On [[1 August]] [[1997]], the Death Eaters managed to stage a [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|coup]] within the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], thus gaining influence over all of [[wizarding world|wizarding Britain]]. One month later, as of [[1 September]], Alecto was appointed as [[Muggle Studies]] teacher as well as [[Deputy Headmaster|Deputy Headmistress]] under the new [[Headmaster]] Severus Snape.<ref name="DH12" /><ref name="DH28" /><ref name="DH11">{{DH|B|11}}</ref>

[[Muggle Studies]] was made a compulsory core class. The curriculum was changed to include the Ministry's anti-[[Non-magic people|Muggle]] propaganda exclusively (instead of teaching aspects of Muggle culture and science).<ref name="PA12">{{POA|B|12}}</ref>

As one of the Deputy Heads, Alecto was in charge of all [[Discipline at Hogwarts|disciplinary action]] (along with her brother). All Hogwarts staff were obliged to report any rule-breaking student to her or her brother (although the staff did not turn students in if they could avoid it). Alecto's disciplinary measures included torture by way of the [[Cruciatus Curse]], as well as binding students with chains, and corporal punishment in the form of beatings.<ref name="DH29">{{DH|B|29}}</ref>

[[Dumbledore's Army]], led by [[Neville Longbottom]], spearheaded the resistance against the Carrows. Alecto made a slash on his face after he asked her how much Muggle [[Blood status|blood]] she and her brother had. The group, which was banned after the reenactment of [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four]], would sneak into the corridors at night and write on the walls with messages like "''Dumbledore's Army, Still Recruiting''". [[Michael Corner]] was caught releasing a [[First year|first-year]] that Alecto and/or Amycus had chained up, and he was thus brutally tortured.<ref name="DH29" />

When Alecto and Amycus understood they had no hold over Neville, they planned to kill him or send him to [[Azkaban]]. As they chased him, Neville vanished into the [[Room of Requirement]], and the rest of Dumbledore's Army soon followed in his footsteps, moving into the room as both Alecto and Amycus tried to hunt them all down.<ref name="DH29" />

====Overthrow====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure.|Alecto Carrow|Which makes you pretty skint, witless.|Alecto catches [[Harry Potter]] in Ravenclaw Tower|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
By the evening of [[1 May]] [[1998]], news of Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]'s [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)|break-in]] of [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] reached the student body; [[Terry Boot]] was beaten up by Alecto and Amycus for yelling about it in the [[Great Hall]] over dinner.<ref name="DH29" />

That same day, as [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] became aware that Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger were [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|hunting down and destroying]] his [[Horcrux]]es, he told Alecto and Amycus that Harry might try to get into [[Ravenclaw Tower]]. At her urgent request [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], [[Head of Ravenclaw House]], let Alecto into the common room, where she stood guard.<ref name="DH30" />

Alecto was keeping watch when Harry arrived with [[Luna Lovegood]]. She immediately touched her [[Dark Mark]], letting Voldemort and all the Death Eaters know that they had got him. Alecto was immediately [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by Luna, and Amycus demanded that Minerva McGonagall let him into the Tower. Once inside, he saw his unconscious sister but no sign of Harry, as both Harry and Luna were hidden beneath Harry's [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]]. Aware that they were going to feel Voldemort's wrath if they did not hand him Harry, Amycus planned to pass it off on the students, and when Professor McGonagall objected calling Amycus and Alecto cowards in the process, he spat in her face. This caused Harry to use the Cruciatus Curse on him, which knocked him out. Minerva McGonagall used a spell to [[Conjuration|conjure]] a net, and the two siblings were tied up and hoisted into the air, where they were left dangling beneath the ceiling.<ref name="DH30" />

===Post-war===
Neither Alecto nor her brother fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] as both of them were kept tied-up at [[Ravenclaw Tower]].<ref name="DH30"/> It is likely that after the battle and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]] they both were imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for their crimes under [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]'s de-corrupted [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

==Physical appearance==
[[File:Alecthog.jpg|150px|thumb|Alecto Carrow at [[Hogwarts Castle]]]] 
Alecto Carrow was a stocky little woman like the [[Fred and George Weasley|Weasley twins]], with a wheezy giggle, much like her brother.<ref name="HBP27" /> Sloping-shouldered, she had stubby fingers and, as a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], she was branded with the [[Dark Mark]] on her forearm.<ref name="DH30" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|They're in charge of all discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.|Neville Longbottom, on the Carrows' love for punishing students|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Alecto was an extreme sadist who enjoyed torturing students or just people in general. Indeed, [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] even claimed that Alecto "made [[Umbridge family|Umbridge]] look tame".<ref name="DH29" /> Alecto had strong [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] beliefs (specifically the belief in [[Blood status|blood purity]]), as she taught that [[blood traitor]]s, [[mudblood]]s, and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s were lesser than [[wizardkind]].<ref name="DH29" /> She was not highly intelligent, however, as she needed [[Filius Flitwick]] to let her into [[Ravenclaw Tower]]. However, she was seemingly slightly brighter than her brother Amycus.<ref name="DH30" /> Like Bellatrix Lestrange, she admired Voldemort and detested "[[blood traitor]]s", [[Muggle-born]]s and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s alike; though unlike Bellatrix, Alecto was not loyal to Voldemort enough to seek him out after his first downfall, nor brave Azkaban in his name. Despite this lack of bravery for the Dark Lord, according to [[Nymphadora Tonks]], Carrow appeared to be prepared to fight to the death during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], resulting in aggressiveness that overwhelmed the [[Order of the Phoenix]].<ref name="HBP29">{{HBP|B|29}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
Alecto Carrow was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], which meant she was adept in the Dark Arts. She along with her brother Amycus, gained an infamous reputation within the wizarding world, particularly during their stint as joint [[Deputy Headmaster/Headmistress|Deputy Heads]] at Hogwarts, as they severely punished students for any rule-breaking within the school.<ref name="DH29" />

*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, Alecto was a natural when it came to the Dark Arts. She showed particular skill in utilising the [[Cruciatus Curse]], as she used it as a common form of punishment during her time as a teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<ref name="DH29" /> It can also be assumed that Alecto was able to summon the [[Dark Mark]], having it branded on her forearm like most Death Eaters. She used this same mark to summon Lord Voldemort when she found Harry Potter in [[Ravenclaw Tower]].<ref name="DH30"/>
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Alecto must have been a somewhat skilled duellist as she was an active participant in both the first and second wizarding wars and survived them both. She participated in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]<ref name="HBP27" /> where she duelled against the extremely powerful witch Minerva McGonagall, however she was forced to retreat with her arms over her head as McGonagall sent spells and insults after her in equal measure.<ref name="HBP28"/> She also wasn't quick enough to block Luna Lovegood's [[Stunning Spell]] upon discovering her and Harry Potter in the Ravenclaw Common Room (although it should be noted she was attempting to summon Voldemort at the time and her focus seemed to be solely on Harry Potter).<ref name="DH30"/>
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most adult wizards and witches, Alecto was capable of apparating at will. Alecto disapparated away from beyond Hogwarts grounds following the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]].<ref name="HBP28"/>
*'''Teaching Skills''': Alecto was a Professor at Hogwarts, where she taught [[Muggle Studies]]. Her teachings conformed to the Ministry propaganda that Muggles are filthy, stupid and like animals that have violently forced wizards and witches into hiding and that the natural order of things was being restored with wizards having supreme dominance over all muggles. Most of the students likely ignored her anti-Muggle teachings and some such as Neville Longbottom verbally opposed them; however, these students would find themselves being severely punished if they did.<ref name="DH29"/>

==Etymology==
===Alecto===
*The name "Alecto" is Greek, and means "unceasing in anger". "Alecto" is known to have been derived from the earlier male name; "Alektos".
*In Greek mythology, [[Wikipedia:Alecto|Alecto]] was one of the [[Wikipedia:Erinyes|Erinyes]], also known as the Furies; they are the Greek personifications of vengeance and pangs of conscience, and are known for being cruel and bloodthirsty towards wrongdoers.

===Carrow===
*In English, the word, "Carrow", can refer to two places. "Carrow" in Norfolk, or "Carraw" in Northumberland. The first is assumed to have its name derived from the Old English word "carr", meaning "rock", and a word of Celtic origin; "hoh", meaning "spur of a hill". While the second appears to have been named either after the plural of the Old English word "carr", or after a mixture of a form of "carr", and another Old English word; "raw", meaning "row".
*The surname may also have derived from the Welsh surname ''Caeriw'' (meaning "dweller at the foot of a hill").
*It is also possible, that the surname was originally a shortened version of the Cornish surname; "''Nancarrow''".

==Behind the scenes==
*Alecto is portrayed by [[Suzie Toase]] in {{HBP|FA}}, {{DH|F1}} and {{DH|F2}}.<ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/suzie-toase-reprise-alecto-carrow-role-deathly-hallows-68309/ Suzie Toase to reprise Alecto Carrow role in Deathly Hallows]</ref>
*Actress [[Vanessa Stevenson]] doubled for Suzanne Toase in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of {{DH}}.
*In the films Alecto is diminished to a background character with no speaking lines. In {{HBP|FA}} she takes no active part in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], witnessing Dumbledore's death without a word and then fleeing with her fellow [[Death Eaters]]. In {{DH|F1}}, she only appears during the [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor]]. In {{DH|F2}}, Alecto and Amycus are stunned by Headmaster [[Severus Snape]]'s deflects of two of [[Minerva McGonagall]]'s curses directed at himself, which either knock them unconscious or kill them (it is not made clear and the pair are not seen again, though it is unlikely that McGonagall would cast a curse that would kill). It is highly likely that Snape intended for this to happen whilst making it look like an accident.
*In {{DH|GA2}}, she appears as one of the foes that [[Harry Potter]] must fight. [[Suzie Toase]] also did the voice of the character for this game.
*[[David Yates]] called Alecto and Amycus "the Carrow twins" though it's unknown if this is considered canon.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nPyasEm3g0 "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2" The Story of Snape]</ref>
*Interestingly, when comparing Alecto and her brother to [[Dolores Umbridge]], the most hated character in the franchise, [[Neville Longbottom]] claims that she makes her look tame.
*Alecto Carrow is possibly [[Female Death Eater at the Graveyard|an unidentified female Death Eater]] who appears in {{GOF|FA}} during the rebirth of Lord Voldemort in the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]], although this is unconfirmed.
*Alecto was likely the same person as the female Death Eater who giggled during the Death Eater [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor|meeting at the Malfoy Manor]]. This woman was described as broad and hunched with pointed teeth, and cackled at [[Charity Burbage]]. These descriptions all apply to Alecto, and she notably laughs when Voldemort mentions Burbage to have been the [[Muggle Studies]] professor, a position Alecto would soon take.
