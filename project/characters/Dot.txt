'''Dot''' (fl. [[1943]]) was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] woman who lived in [[Little Hangleton]]. She knew [[Frank Bryce]] since he was a child.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dot was born to a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] family sometime before [[Frank Bryce]] was born. She was probably born in [[Little Hangleton]], since she remembers seeing him when he was a child, when he showed he had a "horrible temper."

===The Riddle Murders===
She was one of the many town residents who gathered at [[The Hanged Man]] to gossip on the night that the [[Riddle family]] was found murdered in their home in [[1943]]. When it was announced that [[Frank Bryce]] had been arrested, Dot said she thought Frank had always had a fierce temper, and that she had seen evidence of it when he was a child. The police later released Frank for lack of evidence, but Dot remained convinced of his guilt, remarking that he should leave, as all the villagers of [[Little Hangleton]] "knew" he had done it. In all actuality [[Frank Bryce]] was innocent, as the one who slew the [[Riddle family|Riddles]] that night was [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]].
