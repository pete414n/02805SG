'''Dudley Dursley''' (born [[23 June]] [[1980]]) was the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] son of [[Vernon Dursley|Vernon]] and [[Petunia Dursley]] and cousin of [[Harry Potter]]. He was obese and insolent as a result of his parents spoiling him throughout his childhood, although he became muscular in his teens. He and [[Dudley Dursley's gang|his gang]] often tormented Harry as well as other weaker and younger children in their neighbourhood and at school, taking after the example set by Dudley's parents.

In [[1995]], he faced [[Dementor]]s for the first time and was saved by Harry, after which he mellowed and became generally kinder to his cousin. He left [[4 Privet Drive]] in [[1997]], along with his parents, to be hidden and protected themselves from becoming the next victims of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]] by the [[Killing Curse]], under the protection of the [[Order of the Phoenix]].

After the [[Second Wizarding War]], he married a [[Dudley Dursley's wife|woman]] and had two [[Dudley Dursley's children|children]]. He also remained in contact with Harry, as did his wife and children.




Dudley was born around [[23 June]] [[1980]], about five weeks before his cousin [[Harry Potter]]. He was the son of [[Vernon Dursley]] and [[Petunia Dursley]], and the nephew of [[Marjorie Dursley|Marge Dursley]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]].

On [[1 November]] [[1981]], Dudley had a tantrum when Vernon was going to work. He physically abused Petunia when they went out, demanding she provide him with sweets, something that was witnessed by [[Minerva McGonagall]] in her [[Animagus]] form. Hours later, Harry was delivered to the Dursleys after the [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|attack on the Potters]] in [[Godric's Hollow]]. Over the following few weeks, Dudley took to prodding and pinching Harry, whom he found weak. Likely around this time, Dudley was a member of the [[Cubs|Cub Scouts]].

In June [[1985]], his [[Marjorie Dursley|Aunt Marge]] was at [[Privet Drive]] to attend [[Dudley Dursley's fifth birthday|Dudley's fifth birthday party]]. She whacked Harry, who was four years old at the time, around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at [[musical statues]].

Between [[1985]] and [[1990]], Aunt Marge spent [[Christmas]] at [[Privet Drive]]. She brought a [[Dudley Dursley's computerised robot|computerised robot]] for Dudley and a box of [[dog biscuits]] for Harry. 

During their years together at [[St. Grogory's Primary School]], Dudley frequently chose Harry as his favourite target with the help of his friends. Harry was much shorter than Dudley, so Dudley could easily hurt Harry, although Harry was often faster than Dudley.

[[Marjorie Dursley|Aunt Marge]] was present again at [[Dudley Dursley's tenth birthday|Dudley's tenth birthday party]] when Harry was nine. Harry accidentally stepped on [[Ripper]]'s paw, causing the dog to chase Harry out into the garden and up a tree, while Dudley laughed himself silly. Marge refused to call the dog off until past midnight, much to the [[Dursley family|Dursleys']] delight.


Eleventh birthday party

Dudley celebrated his eleventh birthday on [[23 June]] [[1991]]. His presents included a new [[computer]], a second television, a [[Dudley Dursley's remote control aeroplane|remote control aeroplane]], sixteen new computer games, a gold wristwatch, a [[video recorder]], a [[cine-camera]], a [[Remote Control Crane|remote control crane]], a [[Dudley Dursley's racing bike|racing bicycle]], (which Harry found odd, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise if it did not include punching someone) and more. When Dudley counted his presents, he got angry and claimed that he had two fewer than his last birthday, although he actually had one fewer than his last birthday. Petunia promised that when the family went out, she would buy him two more presents, and satisfied with this, he did not throw a tantrum.

The Vanishing Glass
When [[Arabella Figg|Mrs Figg]] called the Dursleys to tell them she could not take Harry for the day because she had broken her leg, Dudley was horrified. While Vernon and Petunia decided what to do with Harry, Dudley pretended to cry, playing on his mother's habit of giving him whatever he wanted. In between "sobs", Dudley commented that he did not want Harry to spoil his birthday by tagging along: when his mother was not looking, he shot Harry a nasty grin. When his friend [[Piers Polkiss]] arrived, he ceased his act immediately.

With no other option, the Dursleys reluctantly took Harry with them to the [[zoo]] for Dudley's birthday (because they could not legally leave him home alone). At the entrance, his parents bought him and Piers large chocolate ice creams. Before they could hurry off, the saleswoman asked Harry what he would like, then Vernon and Petunia were forced to buy Harry a cheap lemon ice lolly, although he seemed to like it regardless. At lunch time, Dudley had a temper tantrum because his  was not big enough, as there was "not enough" ice cream on it: his father bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first one though only because it would be a huge waste to throw out.


After lunch, the group visited the reptile house and Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place which was a sleeping [[Boa constrictor at the zoo|boa constrictor]]. Dudley pressed his nose against the glass and asked his father to make the snake wake up. After much rapping on the glass, it made no movements at all and Dudley walked away, easily bored. A few moments later, Piers drew Dudley's attention back to the snake when he saw Harry talking to it. Waddling over, Dudley quickly shoved Harry out of the way and onto the ground. 

Within a few moments, Dudley found the protective glass gone and he and Piers jumped backwards in shock. As the snake uncoiled itself and slithered off, Dudley and Piers ran away, screaming. Harry had managed to do this with [[underage magic]], although he thought it had been an accidental misunderstanding at the time. Piers tattled on Harry saying that he had seen him talking to the snake. In the car on the way home, Dudley claimed that the snake had nearly bitten his leg off; the snake had actually playfully snapped at Dudley's heel as it went past.

Discovery of the wizarding world

 uniform]]
By the time the summer holidays had begun, Dudley had broken his video camera, crashed the remote-controlled aeroplane, and knocked an already injured Mrs Figg over with his racing bike. Near the beginning of July, Dudley was accepted into [[Smeltings Academy]], his father's alma mater. After returning from London with his new school uniform, Dudley paraded around the house in the get-up, which included a maroon tailcoat, orange knickerbockers, a [[wikipedia:Boater|boater]], and a [[Smelting stick|knobbly stick]]. He took to whacking everyone and everything within reach with this stick, which became extremely annoying to Harry.


The following morning when the post arrived, Dudley alerted his father that Harry had received a [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|letter]]. Seeing his parents' reactions to the letter's contents, Dudley demanded to see it. Not used to being ignored, Dudley rapped his father on the head with his Smelting stick. Dudley and Harry were thrown out of the kitchen, but overheard the conversation through the door: Harry forced to listen under the crack, while Dudley looked through the better position: the peephole in the doorknob.

When Vernon and Petunia gave [[Smallest Bedroom|Dudley's second bedroom]] to Harry, Dudley threw a temper tantrum, claiming that he needed the room. In an attempt to change his parents' minds: Dudley screamed, hit his father with his Smelting stick, threw up on purpose, kicked his mother, and threw his pet tortoise through the greenhouse roof. When the mail arrived, Dudley was sent to collect it (in an attempt by Vernon to be "nice" to Harry). From the hall, Dudley yelled that Harry had received another letter. Vernon wrestled Dudley to the ground and took the letter away, which was made difficult by Harry clinging on to Vernon's neck.


Within a week, 24 or more letters arrived for Harry; Dudley wondered who on Earth would want to talk to Harry so badly. When so many letters for Harry arrived, Vernon, having had enough, told the family to get ready to leave. Dudley angered his father when he dawdled, trying to pack his television, VCR and computer into his bag. By nightfall, Dudley was in an unpleasant mood; he was hungry, had missed five TV shows he wanted to watch and had not gone so long without shooting an alien on his computer. At the [[Railview Hotel]], Dudley shared a room with Harry; while Harry remained awake, Dudley fell asleep almost immediately.

In the Hut-on-the-Rock

The following day, Vernon brought Dudley and the family to the [[Hut-on-the-Rock]] well out in the sea. Using some mouldy blankets, Petunia made Dudley a bed on the couch, which he was ''very'' unhappy with, while she and Vernon took the second bedroom and Harry was left on his own to find comfort.

When Vernon insulted [[Albus Dumbledore]] and after Hagrid informed him that Harry was going to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Hagrid used magic to [[Human to pig spell|sprout]] a [[pig]]'s tail from Dudley's bottom (because Dudley was helping himself to Harry's birthday cake), which caused immense pain â€” something that Harry found enjoyment in.


Arrival at school
After dropping Harry off at [[King's Cross Station]] on [[1 September]], the Dursleys took Dudley to a [[London private hospital|private hospital]] in London to have the tail surgically removed before he went to Smeltings. Over the course of the school year, he grew even more massive: so much so that his bottom drooped over each side of his chair.

Summer vacation

In June, Dudley accompanied his parents to [[King's Cross Station]] to pick Harry up for the summer holidays. In spite of his morbid weight, his clothes were curiously depicted as loose, as he had to hitch up his trousers "which were slipping down his fat bottom" during a conversation with Harry. One morning during breakfast, Dudley wanted more bacon. He asked Harry to pass the frying pan: when Harry said he forgot the magic word (meaning "please"), Dudley fell out of his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen. Obviously, Dudley had been trained by his parents by that time to hate and fear anything that had anything ''at all'' to do with Harry and his world.


On 31 July, Dudley taunted Harry about not receiving any birthday presents from his friends. When Harry pretended that he was going to set a bush on [[fire]] by saying pretend magic words, Dudley ran to his mother, frightened. That night, the Dursleys (sans Harry) hosted a dinner party for [[Mason|clients of Vernon's]] â€” the Masons. At eight o'clock, Dudley was by the front door, waiting for Mr and Mrs Mason to arrive. He offered to take their coats and offered his arm to accompany Mrs Mason to the dining room a while later.

In the early hours of the next morning, Dudley was dumbfounded when he and his parents witnessed Harry's escape with [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], [[George Weasley|George]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] in their father's [[flying Ford Anglia]].

Learning about Sirius Black
By the next summer, Dudley was even fatter. At some point, he complained about the walk between the living room and the kitchen, so his father installed a new TV in the kitchen as a welcome-home-for-the-summer present. Dudley sat at the TV all day, eating constantly. His face also gained a fat appearance and made him look like he had an unsightly double chin.

Along with his parents and Harry, Dudley learned one day of an escaped convict named [[Sirius Black]], who the newscasters warned was armed and dangerous. Vernon was constantly complaining about lack of security and punishment, stating that hanging was the only way to handle people like Black.


On 31 July, Dudley's [[Marjorie Dursley|Aunt Marge]] came to visit their house. When Marge arrived, Dudley waddled into the hall to greet her. Marge seized him in a one-armed hug and kissed him on the cheek. Harry, sure that Dudley only put up with this treatment because he was well paid for it, noticed a twenty-pound note clenched in his fat hand behind his back. When Marge was blown up by Harry because of her voracious veracity, Dudley showed almost no emotion and continued watching TV. It can be assumed that he was used to the odd things that happened whenever his cousin was around.

Dudley's diet

By the summer of 1994, Dudley had grown so large that the school outfitters at [[Smeltings Academy]] did not stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore; he had reached roughly the size and weight of a baby killer whale. To rectify the situation, the school nurse forced a diet regime upon Dudley, which emptied his eating habits of all the things he enjoyed: fizzy drinks, cakes, chocolate bars, burgers, doughnuts, chips, etc. and replaced them with fruits and vegetables â€” things that [[Vernon Dursley|Vernon]] called "rabbit food." 

Dudley was not pleased and threw numerous tantrums about it. To make Dudley feel better, [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] insisted that the whole family follow the diet, as well: to raise Dudley's morale, she also tended to give him more to eat than Harry (who, unbeknownst to Dudley, kept a secret stash of food in his bedroom). When Vernon left the kitchen to collect the post, Dudley stole his grapefruit quarter.


The next day when the Weasleys arrived to take Harry to the [[Quidditch World Cup]], Dudley nervously ran his hands over his backside: remembering the incident with Hagrid in 1991, he was unwilling to present the same target to wizards again.

As the Weasleys returned to [[the Burrow]] through the [[Floo Network]], Fred "accidentally" dropped numerous sweets in brightly coloured wrappers on the floor, knowing Dudley would eat one of them. The sweet revealed to be a [[Ton-Tongue Toffee]], caused Dudley's tongue to expand greatly and cause him pain. Before allowing [[Arthur Weasley|Mr Weasley]] to fix it, Petunia tried to rip the tongue out of Dudley's mouth, which nearly suffocated him. His tongue was more than four feet long before the Dursleys allowed Mr Weasley to shrink it.

[[Attack in Little Whinging|Dementor attack]]


In 1995, Dudley took up boxing, which gave him even more prominence over other children. As a result, he lost weight and became less spoiled. However, he was still described as "vast as ever", but it was implied that his bulk was more muscle than fat because of the boxing. He would roam the streets with his gang, vandalising public property, taking up smoking and terrorising younger children. After taking up his workout regime, Dudley became boxing champion at his school. At one point they beat up a boy for "cheeking him".


Along with his parents, Dudley learned that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned to a physical body, with the intent of subjugating both the wizarding and Muggle communities once again. On his way home one night with his [[Dudley Dursley's gang|gang]], Dudley ran into Harry. He and Harry were attacked in the street by two [[Dementor]]s, sent by [[Dolores Umbridge]] to harm Harry (unknown to Harry). 

Harry's [[Deer|stag]] [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] saved them from being [[Dementor's kiss|kissed]], The encounter with the Dementors forced Dudley, for the first time, to recognise the kind of person he really was: a cruel bully. It was a terribly painful moment for him, and led to him changing his ways.

Visited by Albus Dumbledore


When [[Albus Dumbledore]] paid a personal visit to the Dursleys in [[1996]], he showed pity for Dudley, blaming the Dursleys for the "appalling damage" their parenting inflicted on their son. Dudley was very confused by this statement, and did not show any signs of planning to rectify his parents' "mistakes".

As Harry and Dumbledore leave, Dumbledore told the Dursleys that in summer 1997 that they have to evacuate their house to protect themselves from becoming the victims of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and [[Death Eaters]].


After Harry arrived at Number Four, in 1997, Dudley made at least one known attempt to reconcile with Harry. Dudley placed a cup of tea outside Harry's room. However, Harry initially misinterpreted the gesture as another prank, as Dudley had placed the cup on the floor and Harry stepped on it by accident. When Harry parted ways with the Dursleys, Dudley was the only member to bid Harry farewell.

]]
When Dudley was attacked by the [[Dementor]]s he saw himself, for the first time, as he really was. This was an extremely painful but ultimately salutary lesson and began the transformation in him. He shook Harry's hand and thanked him for saving his life. The members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] escorting the Dursleys into hiding were not satisfied by this and thought a more adequate apology was in order, but the Dursleys left with nothing more to say, Harry himself noting that Dudley's awkward thanks was the Dursley equivalent of a heartfelt expression of gratitude.


In Dudley's adult life, he got [[Dudley Dursley's wife|married]] and became a [[Dudley Dursley's children|father of two]]. He and Harry remained on "Christmas card terms," and Harry sometimes took his children to Dudley's when they were in the neighbourhood, occasions dreaded by [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]]. During these visits Dudley and Harry would sit silently together rarely talking while their children interacted and played together. It is unknown if Dudley ever returned to [[Little Whinging]] or if their family had stayed in the place they were relocated to, or if they had moved elsewhere. By 2020, Dudley's mother had passed away.




Dudley had watery blue eyes and thick blond hair. Growing up, Dudley was extremely fat, at least four times Harry's size. Harry often thought Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. In 1994, he had "''reached the size and weight of a young killer whale''" â€” somewhere between 265 and 353 pounds. Dudley was too large to fit in a school uniform, so was forced to go on a diet by his school, which was largely comprised of food which Vernon called "rabbit food" (fruits and vegetables) which Dudley rarely ate otherwise. [[Vernon Dursley|Vernon]] and [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] usually made excuses on why he was large, such as that his poundage was really "puppy fat" or that he was a "growing boy".

Dudley mostly ate junk food, hated exercise, and often played video games. When Harry and the Dursleys ate breakfast Dudley's flab would often hang off the chair because he was too big and eventually a TV was bought for the kitchen after Dudley had complained about the distance from the living room to the fridge, which was an example of his great laziness. This may have had something to do with his weight problem.

However, by 1995 after he was attacked by [[Umbridge family|Umbridge]]'s dementors, Dudley had taken up boxing and weight lifting, and lost a great deal of weight. Before to the Dursleys left [[Privet Drive]], he appeared "large, blond, and muscular," wearing a leather jacket.




Dudley was an unpleasant and spoiled child. His parents spoiled him to the point of becoming grossly obese, demanding, selfish, and manipulative, but most of all, extremely ungrateful. During his eleventh birthday, he screamed when he received one gift fewer than the previous year, making his parents promise to buy him two more, and pretended to cry when he realised Harry would have to come with him for his birthday trip to the [[zoo]].

Dudley had an awful habit of bullying children who were weaker and as much as five years younger than he was, and when he forgot his fear of Harry's [[Magic|powers]], callously insulted him in any way possible, even jeering at Harry about his obviously disturbing nightmares.

Despite being fairly manipulative, Dudley appeared to have a low level of intelligence. In [[1991]], whilst [[Rubeus Hagrid]] was attempting to enter the [[Hut-on-the-Rock]], he foolishly quoted "Where's the cannon?" showing poor common sense. In the school holiday of [[1994]], he received a dismal school report from [[Smeltings Academy]], which included very poor academic results as well as reports of bullying others.

However, in [[1995]], Dudley faced [[dementor]]s for the first time. Though a Dementor attack typically forced a person to re-live the worst moments of their life, Dudley's life-so-far of luxury and greed contained no "worst moments," and therefore, during the attack, Dudley saw himself as the spoiled, rotten and cruel bully he truly was. He was thus forced, rather harshly, to realise he needed to change his ways. This led to him regretting his treatment of Harry and his later attempts at reconciliation.




 and [[Petunia Dursley]]]]
Vernon and Petunia Dursley spoiled and coddled their son as much as they neglected and abused their nephew [[Harry Potter|Harry]]. They appeared to buy Dudley anything he wanted, often apparently to waylay a tantrum (Vernon going so far as bribing him to accept a kiss from [[Marjorie Dursley|Aunt Marge]]). They indulged their son with treats and activities both out of blind adoration for the boy and as a means of emphasising to Harry what he was missing. 

They were generally in denial of the obesity brought on by Dudley's gluttony, which they wrote off as being either the healthy appetite of a growing boy or that his poundage was really "puppy fat" and were completely oblivious to the fact that Dudley did not have friends, so much as a schoolyard [[Dudley Dursley's gang|gang]] and victims.

While Vernon consistently praised his son as if he was extremely masculine and robust, Petunia infantilised Dudley, calling him "Diddykins" well in to his teen years, appearing heartbroken to have to put Dudley on a much-needed diet and even bursting into tears when Dudley showed marginal affection for Harry.



, his maternal cousin]]
Dudley and his cousin Harry did not get along very well for most of their early lives. Like his parents, Dudley only thought of Harry as a huge burden to the family. While [[Vernon Dursley|Vernon]] and [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] treated Harry poorly, they spoiled Dudley to the extreme. Dudley constantly bullied Harry throughout their childhood, but did his best not to provoke him after he found out that Harry was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], though the two still often argued and traded insults. This changed after Harry saved Dudley from a pair of [[dementor]]s that attacked them during the summer of [[1995]]. 

When the [[Order of the Phoenix]] placed the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] into hiding to keep them safe during the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Dudley was the only member of the family to express concern for Harry's safety, asking his parents why Harry was not accompanying them and where he would go, if not with them. He also expressed remorse for his earlier treatment of Harry and the two shook hands before the Dursleys left.

After the Second Wizarding War, Dudley later became a cousin-in-law to Harry's wife [[Ginevra Weasley]] and a first cousin once removed to Harry and Ginny's children, [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Potter]]. Dudley and Harry eventually reconciled as adults, remaining on "Christmas card terms" and visiting each other occasionally. At these times, Harry's three children and Dudley's [[Dudley Dursley's children|children]] would all play together while their fathers would sit together quietly.

When his mother, Petunia, died, Dudley was still on good terms with Harry. While cleaning out her possessions, he found the [[Harry Potter's blanket|blanket]] that Harry had been wrapped in when he arrived at 4 Privet Drive and [[Muggle Mail|mailed]] it to him, believing that Petunia wanted him to have it.

Dudley means "''from the meadow''". It is also a  located in the  county of England which, as with the town of Dursley, is known for its coal mining in the Victorian era. [[J. K. Rowling]] implied that she took the name from the town, commenting "''maps are a great source for names''", then adding "''[[Dursley family|Dursley]] and Dudley and [[Severus Snape|Snape]] are all places I can't visit anymore''".

 is a town in Gloucestershire, England. Rowling has commented that she visited the place as a child and hated it, which likely affected her choice of surname for the awful family, remarking "I don't imagine I'm very popular in Dursley". Rowling chose the name because it sounded "dull and forbidding".

*Dudley was portrayed by [[Harry Melling]] in the film series.
*It is never made clear if Dudley was aware of Harry being a wizard before the latter read his Hogwarts letter. However, since he was said to avoid being in the same room with Harry after the truth was said, it can be assumed that Vernon and Petunia never told him. In addition, his parents probably did not want him to believe in [[magic]].

*Although not mentioned in the books, [[J. K.

*In the books, Dudley's hair is blond, but in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], it is dark brown.
*Dudley is portrayed as fat in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|books]] and films. In an interview on the  [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|film]] DVD, [[Harry Melling]] stated he had lost weight and had to wear a fat suit in order to show Dudley's chubbiness.

*Dudley is similar to [[Draco Malfoy]] in some ways. Both are boys who are the only children of their parents. Both are spoiled, although [[Lucius Malfoy|Draco's father]] was firm at times and had high expectations for him. Draco has white-blonde hair and Dudley is blonde in the books. Both have mothers who are named after flowers ([[Petunia Dursley]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy]]). Both boys' parents enjoyed the idea of a prominent, wealthy social status - the Malfoys are a very wealthy Wizarding family, while the Dursleys have a goal of moving up in society. Draco and Dudley both lead a gang of friends, Draco being the leader of [[Draco Malfoy's gang]] and Dudley being the leader of [[Dudley Dursley's gang]]. Harry was bullied by both Draco and Dudley for years - Dudley in the Muggle world, Draco in the wizarding world - though he eventually reconciles with both of them.
*In , Dudley (and Vernon) possess [[superhuman strength]], which allows them to pull special orange handles. Being both Muggles, this [[canon]]ically cannot be magical strength, but merely brute physical strength.
