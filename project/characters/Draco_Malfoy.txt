{{Quote|I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, I imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.|Draco showing his prejudice at a young age|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
'''Draco Lucius'''<ref>See [[:File:Draco Lucius Malfoy.jpg|this image]].</ref> '''Malfoy''' (b. [[5 June]] [[1980]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the only son of [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy]] {{c|née [[House of Black|Black]]}}. The son of a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], Draco was raised to strongly believe in the [[Pure-blood supremacy|importance]] of [[Blood status|blood purity]]. He looked down on [[half-blood]]s and [[Muggle-born]]s.

Draco attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1991]]-[[1998]]. He was sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] the moment the [[Sorting Hat]] touched his head. During his years at Hogwarts, he became friends with [[Vincent Crabbe]], [[Gregory Goyle]], [[Pansy Parkinson]], and other fellow Slytherins, but he quickly developed a rivalry with [[Harry Potter]].

He was made a [[prefect]] of his house and was a member of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] during his fifth year, at the end of which his father was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] following the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] charged Draco with making up for Lucius's failure, and he became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] at age sixteen but was quickly disillusioned with the lifestyle.               

Draco was unable to complete his task of murdering [[Albus Dumbledore]], which was later taken over by [[Severus Snape]], and only performed his other duties fearfully and reluctantly. He and his family defected hours before the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], fearing for their lives.              

By [[2017]], Draco had married [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]] and had one child, [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy]]. 

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1980–1991}}===
====Growing up in Malfoy Manor====
[[File:Draco Black Malfoy.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Draco on the [[House of Black|Black Family Tree]] tapestry]]
Draco Lucius Malfoy was born on [[5 June]] [[1980]], to [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy]] (née [[House of Black|Black]]),<ref>[[House of Black|Black family tree]]</ref> who were both born into old, wealthy [[pure-blood]] families. Both the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]]' and the Blacks had traditionally been in [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] for centuries and strongly disapproved of any relatives who did not follow in this tradition, such as [[Sirius Black]].<ref name="COS">{{COS}}</ref> 

Draco was raised in an atmosphere of regret that the [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had not succeeded in taking command of the wizarding community, although he was prudently reminded that such sentiments ought not to be expressed outside the small circle of the family and their close friends 'or Daddy might get into trouble'. The [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]]' were very proud of their [[Pure-blood]] and social status; until [[1996]], they were able to maintain a respectable public image while being allied with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Lucius was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who avoided imprisonment in [[Azkaban]] following the [[First Wizarding War]] by claiming that he had been under the [[Imperius Curse]], while [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] merely agreed with the ideology of [[pure-blood supremacy]]. 

The Malfoys spoiled their son, giving him the best of everything as far as material possessions go. The only two hand-me-down things Draco ever received were the old family prejudice against [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s, [[Muggle-born]]s, [[half-breed]]s, and [[blood traitor]]s — in short, prejudice against anyone who was not a pure-blood wizardkind, or anyone who supports these types of people — and the Malfoy family's vast collection of powerful dark artefacts harking back to the family history.

====Preparing for Hogwarts====
[[File:Draco Malfoy HM.png|250px|thumb|left|A young Draco Malfoy speaking to Jacob's sibling at Hogwarts]]
In his childhood, Draco associated mainly with the pure-blood children of his father's ex-[[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] cronies and therefore arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] with [[Draco Malfoy's gang|a small gang of friends]] already made, including [[Theodore Nott]] and [[Vincent Crabbe]].<ref name="PM"/> He visited the school himself when Lucius came to inspect, and his father entrusted [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Merula Snyde]] to babysit him, a decision which did not rub off well with any of the three. Lucius had requested the two in particular, as Jacob's sibling was ostensibly the best student in their year, whilst Merula was the daughter of two of Lucius' former Death Eater colleagues and thus considered the 'right' type of person for Draco to associate with. Draco did not endear himself to either student, however, particularly with his snobbish and disdainful attitude towards them and open displays of prejudice.<ref name="HMmalfoy">{{HM|2|MEET THE MALFOYS}}</ref>

During the visit, Draco stole his father's wand, as he was too young to have his own and wanted to perform magic after seeing Merula perform the [[Jelly-Legs Curse]] on Jacob's sibling. Lucius initially blamed the theft on their [[House-elf]] [[Dobby]], as the perpetrator knew he kept [[Lucius Malfoy's wand|his wand]] inside his [[Lucius Malfoy's walking stick|walking stick]], which wasn't common knowledge. Jacob's sibling investigated, and returned the wand to Lucius.<ref name="HMmalfoy2">{{HM|2|MEET THE MALFOYS|4}}</ref>

When the time came for Draco to attend school in [[1991]], his [[Lucius Malfoy|father]] wanted him to attend [[Durmstrang Institute]], a school in Northern [[Europe]] that taught the [[Dark Arts]] and did not admit [[Muggle-born]]s. However, his [[Narcissa Malfoy|mother]] did not like the idea of Draco going to school far away, and Draco had expressed interest in Hogwarts after being impressed by his encounter with Merula. Thus they sent him to Hogwarts.<ref name="GOF" /><ref name="HMmalfoy2" />

When Draco went to [[Diagon Alley]] to shop for school supplies in 1991, he met [[Harry Potter]] in [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions]], without knowing who he was. He made a rather intolerant speech about [[Muggle-born]]s and [[Rubeus Hagrid]], but otherwise acted in quite a friendly manner towards Harry Potter.<ref name="PS" />

===Hogwarts years {{C|1991–1998}}===
====First year====
{{Quote|You know how I think they choose people for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|Gryffindor team]]. It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], who've got no money — you should be on the team, [[Neville Longbottom|Longbottom]], you've got no brains.|Draco mocking Gryffindor students|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:SortingHat WB F1 DracoMalfoyInTheSortingHat Still 100615 Land.jpg|250px|thumb|Draco being sorted into Slytherin House]]
While on the [[Hogwarts Express]] for the very first time, Draco Malfoy offered his friendship to Harry Potter as his [[Lucius Malfoy|father]] believed that Harry was a Dark wizard, and Draco wished to impress him and relay some interesting news home. However, Harry didn't like the attitude Draco expressed towards [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], with whom Harry had already made friends, and also found that Draco reminded him of his cousin [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]], with his disdainful attitude. Thus, he turned him down, creating animosity that lasted through the rest of their schooling.<ref name="PS" />

Once at Hogwarts, Draco was Sorted into the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]], like many other members of his family. He rapidly formed friendships with fellow Slytherins, while remaining hostile toward Harry to the point of challenging him to a [[Duelling|duel]], after Harry beat him to Neville Longbottom's [[Remembrall]] during their first [[Flying (class)|Flying lesson]]. This was, in fact, an attempt to get Harry into trouble for being out after curfew. He resented the attention Harry received because of his fame and his prodigious flying ability, which led to Harry being permitted to join his house's [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch team|team]] at a younger age than most.<ref name="PS" />

[[File:WB F1 Fang HarryMalfoyFangInForest 11428.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Draco in the [[Forbidden Forest]] with Harry Potter during their detention]]
Later in the year, Draco discovered Harry's plan to smuggle Hagrid's pet dragon [[Norberta|Norbert]] out of the castle and informed [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] of it, but was put in detention as well for being out past curfew. For his detention, Draco had to assist [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], [[Harry Potter|Harry]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], who had been caught shortly after smuggling Norbert out, as well as [[Neville Longbottom]], who had tried to warn them about Draco, in finding a wounded [[unicorn]]. This was a task he greatly resented because he found it to be 'servants' work'. He and Harry witnessed [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], inhabiting the body of [[Quirinus Quirrell]], drinking the [[Unicorn blood|blood]] of a unicorn and ran away in fear leaving Harry behind.<ref name="PS" />

At the end of the school year, Draco was initially overjoyed that Slytherin was on course to win the [[House Cup]] again, but was very dejected to see [[Gryffindor]] win the cup once [[Albus Dumbledore]] awarded Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville additional house points for their brave actions.<ref name="PS">{{PS}}</ref>

====Second year====
{{Quote|Saint Potter, the Mudbloods' friend... He's another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around with that jumped-up Granger Mudblood. And people think he's Slytherin's heir!|Draco on speculation that Harry is the Heir of Slytherin|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:1992 Quidditch spectator beside Irma Pince.png|250px|thumb|Draco mocking Harry Potter in Flourish and Blotts]]
Before the start of his second year, Draco Malfoy was present at [[Flourish and Blotts]] the day Harry, the [[Granger family|Grangers]] and the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]] were shopping for [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s new Hogwarts textbooks. After Harry was given a free copy of books by Lockhart personally, Draco afterwards approached him to insult him, and after [[Ginevra Weasley]] defended him, he mocked her as his girlfriend (unintentionally predicting the future). Draco's father [[Lucius Malfoy]] was also present, who met Harry for the first time, and also encountered Arthur Weasley, who he insulted for associating with Muggles, such as the Grangers. Arthur then attacked Lucius in an angry rage, prompting them all to leave the shop.<ref name="COS" />

[[File:Harry-potter2 draco hermione.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Draco calling Hermione Granger the derogatory term <nowiki>'</nowiki>''Mudblood''<nowiki>'</nowiki>]]In his second year at Hogwarts, Draco attained the position of [[Seeker]] on the [[Slytherin]] [[Quidditch]] [[Slytherin Quidditch team|team]]. His [[Lucius Malfoy|father]] bought the entire team new [[Nimbus 2001]]s because of this, though [[Hermione Granger]] openly speculated that this was in fact what got Draco on the team at all. Draco responded angrily to this accusation, and called Hermione a <nowiki>'</nowiki>''filthy little [[Mudblood]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, causing the Gryffindor Quidditch team to lash out at him; [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] tried to [[Slug-Vomiting Charm|curse him to vomit slugs]], but the spell backfired due to his broken wand, which Draco and his team found very amusing.<ref name="COS" />

Ironically, Draco was the reason why Slytherin lost to Gryffindor that year in Quidditch, because he was unaware that the [[Golden Snitch]] was hovering inches above his own left ear--too busy insulting Harry Potter to notice. Harry took advantage of the lapse in concentration, allowing Gryffindor to win the match and Draco to be reprimanded by the team captain [[Marcus Flint]] for his stupidity, which was witnessed by [[George Weasley]].<ref name="COS" />

[[File:Serpensortia.gif|250px|thumb|Draco summoning a snake while duelling Harry Potter]]
During a meeting of the short-lived [[Duelling Club]] that year, Draco duelled Harry Potter. He [[Snake Summons Spell|conjured a snake]] after being encouraged by Professor Snape and was disappointed when Harry thwarted the attack by speaking to the serpent in [[Parseltongue]]. This led many students to suspect that Harry was the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]], who had opened the [[Chamber of Secrets]] and released a '[[Serpent of Slytherin|monster]]'. This caused Draco to be upset that any one would actually think that <nowiki>'</nowiki>''saint Potter, the Mudbloods' friend''<nowiki>'</nowiki> could be the heir of Slytherin, which was something that he thought was completely ridiculous.<ref name="COS" />

[[File:Harry Ron polyjuice2.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Draco unknowingly being interrogated by Harry Potter and Ron Weasley]]
Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspected that Draco might be the Heir, given his bigoted views on [[Muggle-born]]s and his family's tradition of being Sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. Hermione brewed [[Polyjuice Potion]] in the girls' third floor bathroom so that Harry and Ron were able to disguise themselves as [[Gregory Goyle]] and [[Vincent Crabbe]] respectively and enter the Slytherin common room. There, Draco unwittingly revealed through conversation that he was not the heir, nor did he know who it was. He did tell them that the Chamber had been opened fifty years ago and that he wished he could help the true heir.<ref name="COS" />

It was, in fact, Draco's own father who had schemed to get the [[Chamber of Secrets]] opened by planting [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|an old diary]] of Tom Riddle's on first-year student [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], though his true target in this plot was her father [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]]. It does not appear that Draco was aware of this, as Lucius's instructions to his son that year were to <nowiki>'</nowiki>''keep his head down''<nowiki>'</nowiki>. The diary was a [[Horcrux]], containing a piece of Voldemort's soul, and it was destroyed when Harry stabbed it with a Basilisk fang while in the chamber itself.<ref name="COS" />  When [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] and [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] were applauded for bringing everyone who was petrified back to their normal ways, Draco did not clap for them, but instead gave them an evil snobbish look.<ref name="COS">{{COS}}</ref>

====Third year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Draco|I'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer. Father's not very happy about my injury...he's complained to the school governors. And to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Father's got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury like this...who knows if my arm'll ever be the same again?|Harry Potter|So that's why you're putting it on. To try and get Hagrid sacked.|Well, ''partly'', Potter. But there are other benefits too.|Discussion of Draco's injury in a [[Potions (class)|Potions]] class|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
Draco started off his [[1993|third year]] by mocking [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s reaction to the [[Dementor]]s that were near Hogwarts that year searching for escaped [[Azkaban]] prisoner [[Sirius Black]], despite being terrified of them himself. He also hinted at Black's crimes regarding Harry and his [[James and Lily Potter|late parents]], which Harry was unaware of for some time, and told him that if someone had betrayed and got his parents killed  — as it was believed Black had done to the [[Potter family|Potters]] — he would seek revenge.<ref name="POA" />

[[File:Pansy comforting an injured Draco POAF.jpg|250px|thumb|Draco showing [[Pansy Parkinson]] his injured arm]]
In a [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lesson, Draco unintentionally provoked the [[Hippogriff]] [[Buckbeak]], and was injured, though he exaggerated how badly he was hurt for attention, and in an attempt to use the incident against [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to get him fired.<ref name="POA" />

During the [[Quidditch]] match against [[Ravenclaw]], Draco, [[Vincent Crabbe]], [[Gregory Goyle]], and [[Marcus Flint]] attempted to undermine Harry's performance by posing as [[Dementor]]s — Draco standing on Goyle's shoulders — but they were all knocked over by Harry's first successful automatic [[Patronus Charm]], clearly unaware that it was the effect the Dementors had on Harry that he had a problem with rather than the Dementors themselves. Their attempt to sabotage Harry's performance ended up costing the Slytherin House 50 points.<ref name="POA" />

[[File:Hermione punching Draco GIF.gif|250px|thumb|left|[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] [[Muggle duelling|punching]] Draco]]
When Draco mocked Hagrid for how upset he became over the case, Hermione slapped<!--Don't change this to 'punched'. The book supersedes the film; see the wiki canon policy.--> Draco in anger. Lucius tried to get the creature executed, and although he was successful in obtaining this sentence, [[Buckbeak]] was saved through the efforts of [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] with the help of a [[time-turner]], and given to [[Sirius Black|Black]] when his innocence was proven to Harry, Ron and Hermione. This outcome angered both Draco and his father.<ref name="POA">{{POA}}</ref>

====Fourth year====
{{Quote|Granger, they're after Muggles, D'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around... they're moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.|Draco intimidating the [[trio]] during the [[Reappearance of the Dark Mark|riot]] at the Quidditch world cup|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Malfoys in Top Box.jpg|250px|thumb|Draco with his father at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup]]
In [[1994]], Draco attended the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]] with his parents. They sat in the [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]]'s luxury box as guests of the Minister, due to [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]]'s large donation. He was seated directly behind trio and the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]]. He taunted [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] when a group of [[Death Eaters]] began terrorising the campers after the game, mocking the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s they were tormenting and implying that they would do the same to Hermione because of her [[Muggle-born]] status. Harry asked if his father ([[Lucius Malfoy]]) was participating in the riot and he responded with 'if they were, I wouldn't be likely to tell you', as the answer was yes. Once on the train to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] Draco proceeded to mock the trio about their lack of knowledge regarding the upcoming school event.<ref name="GOF" />

[[File:B4C18M1 Densaugeo and Furnunculus.png|250px|thumb|left|Draco after unintentionally hitting Hermione with the ''[[Densaugeo]]'' hex during a short duel with Harry]]
During his fourth year Hogwarts hosted the [[Triwizard Tournament]], and, much to Draco's dismay and jealousy, Harry was chosen as a champion despite being too young. Draco supported [[Cedric Diggory]], passing out badges that could be made to read ''Potter Stinks'' and taunting Harry regularly, such as commenting that he was betting Harry wouldn't last more than a few minutes with the [[dragon]]s. He was proven wrong when Harry tied with Cedric for first place and succeeded in capturing his [[golden egg]] the fastest.<ref name="GOF" />

He was also the informer and impetus behind [[Rita Skeeter]] writing slanderous, sensationalist articles about [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', due to him knowing that she was an [[animagus]]; this assault on Harry's credibility would set the stage for widespread disbelief of Harry's announcement that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned at the end of the school year. Some of the articles that he was partly for was one about Harry and Hermione titled ''Harry Potter's Secret Heartache''.<ref name="GOF" />

[[File:Malfoy Ferret.gif|250px|thumb|[[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] (disguised as Professor [[Alastor Moody|Moody]]) scaring Draco Malfoy by transfiguring him into a ferret]]
When Draco tried to cast a [[Draco Malfoy's unspecified spell|spell]] at Harry early in the year behind his back, the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor [[Bartemius Crouch Junior]] (disguised as [[Alastor Moody]] using [[Polyjuice Potion]]) [[Ferret to human spell|transformed]] Draco into a [[ferret]] and bounced him around the room as punishment. Although [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] stopped it, Draco was very embarrassed and other students were highly amused; Ron dubbed him <nowiki>'</nowiki>''the Amazing Bouncing Ferret''<nowiki>'</nowiki>. Throughout the year, students would tease Draco by telling him that [[Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] was behind him, causing him to flinch or shudder. Even Hagrid noted that he had heard that Draco had made a good ferret, making Draco not know what to say. At [[Christmas]] time, Draco attended the [[Yule Ball]] with [[Pansy Parkinson]].<ref name="GOF" />

At the end of the year, Draco mocked Harry about his choice to side against Voldemort and also ridiculed [[Cedric Diggory]]'s death. Before he could finish, however, he was hit by several [[curse]]s from Harry, [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Fred and George Weasley]].<ref name="GOF">{{GOF}}</ref>

====Fifth year====
{{Quote|The [[Inquisitorial Squad]]... A select group of students who are supportive of the [[Ministry of Magic]], hand-picked by [[Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]. Members of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] do have the power to dock points... So, Granger, I'll have five from you for being rude about our new headmistress... [[Ernest Macmillan|Macmillan]], five for contradicting me... Five because I don't like you, Potter... Weasley, your shirt's untucked, so I'll have another five for that... Oh yeah, I forgot, you're a Mudblood, Granger, so ten for that...|Draco as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
In [[1995]], Draco became a [[Slytherin]] [[prefect]] along with [[Pansy Parkinson]]. He was sure to mock [[Harry Potter]] for not receiving the same honour, as [[Gryffindor]]'s prefects were [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. He also wrote the lyrics to the demeaning song ''[[Weasley is Our King]]'', which mocked Ron's Quidditch abilities as Gryffindor [[Keeper]]. It was the invention of this song, as well as insulting [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] and [[Arthur Weasley]] and the late [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]] to Harry, Fred, and George's faces that prompted Harry and George to get into a fight with Draco. They violently assaulted him, which resulted in the pair (as well as George's twin brother Fred) being banned from all further [[Quidditch]] matches, although their bans were later lifted after [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s sacking from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and her being put on suspension for her actions.<ref name="OTP" />

[[File:Draco2hp5.png|250px|thumb|left|Malfoy joining Dolores Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad]]
Later that year, he joined Umbridge's [[Inquisitorial Squad]], and clearly enjoyed the power this gave him over other students. He held this power over Harry and his friends especially. All of the Squad members were Slytherins, as Umbridge was bias and favoured students of her former house. Draco caught Harry running out of the last meeting of [[Dumbledore's Army]], receiving fifty house points, for Slytherin, from Umbridge.<ref name="OTP" />

Later, he was among the Inquisitorial Squad members who caught Harry and his friends in their attempt to discover the whereabouts of [[Sirius Black]], whom Harry had seen being tortured in a vision, planted by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Harry, Ron, Hermione, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Neville Longbottom]], and [[Luna Lovegood]] were all brought to Umbridge's office, guarded by the Inquisitorial Squad. Before Umbridge could carry through on her threat to use the [[Cruciatus Curse]] to make Harry talk, Hermione told Umbridge that they were trying to contact [[Albus Dumbledore]] about a 'weapon' that he planned to use against the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Draco had an expression of 'eagerness and greed' at this news that convinced Umbridge not to allow him or any other Squad member to accompany her as she took Harry and Hermione into the [[Forbidden Forest]] in search of the alleged weapon.<ref name="OTP" />

[[File:InquistorialSquadOffice.jpg|250px|thumb|The Inquisitorial Squad holding several D.A. members hostage for Umbridge]]
After Umbridge left, the remaining D.A. (Dumbledore's Army) members used a litany of [[Stunning Spell]]s and [[Disarming Charm]]s to escape the office; Draco was hit by Ginny's [[Bat-Bogey Hex]]. It was soon revealed that Hermione had been lying about a weapon; Umbridge was carried off by [[centaur]]s and the six D.A. members flew to the Ministry, where the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] ensued.<ref name="OTP" />

Draco's father was seen participating in the battle as a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for his crimes. Draco was very upset by this, and mainly blamed Harry, swearing vengeance and attempting to attack him at the end of the school year with the help of [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]]. However, other [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members came to Harry's defence, resulting in Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle ending up looking like ugly slug-like things after being hit by a number of hexes by all D.A. Members at the same time.<ref name="OTP">{{OOTP}}</ref>

====Sixth year====

[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-movie-screencaps.com-2897.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Draco talking to [[Pansy Parkinson]] and [[Blaise Zabini]] on the [[Hogwarts Express]] about his mission from Voldemort]]
By late [[1996]], Draco joined the [[Death Eaters]], having replaced his incarcerated [[Lucius Malfoy|father]]. He bragged about having been given a mission to his fellow [[Slytherin]] students on his way to school on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. However, as the year dragged on, Draco became increasingly afraid that he would fail in his seemingly impossible task — to kill [[Albus Dumbledore]]. It is implied that Draco was expected to fail and that [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] assigned him the task with the intention of punishing [[Lucius Malfoy]] for his failure at the [[Department of Mysteries]]. The safety of his family rested on Draco's success with his mission. When Harry overhead some parts of Draco's conversation with his fellow Slytherins about the mission, Draco used a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] to paralyse Harry and stomped hard on his face, crushing his nose, in revenge for imprisoning his father, Lucius, causing Harry to hate Draco more than ever, while disregarding what Harry heard as not important enough to condemn him.<ref name="HBP" />

Draco planned to repair a [[Hogwarts-Borgin and Burkes Vanishing Cabinet pair|Vanishing Cabinet]] that [[Peeves]] had destroyed four years previously, in order to smuggle [[Death Eaters]] into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to assist him in killing Dumbledore. In his previous year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] a fellow [[Slytherin]], [[Graham Montague]], had been forced into it by the [[Fred Weasley|Weasley]] [[George Weasley|twins]] and later managed to [[Apparition|apparate]] out as a last resort to free himself from the limbo-like space into which he had vanished. Montague told Draco that during his time trapped in limbo, he could hear the sounds entering the cabinet from the school, as well as the sounds entering the cabinet's twin in [[Borgin and Burkes]]. Draco realised from this that if the broken one was repaired, the cabinets could act as a passageway into the school.<ref name="HBP" />

[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-movie-screencaps.com-2485.jpg|250px|thumb|Draco preparing to enter [[Borgin and Burkes]], wanting to question Borgin]]
During the summer break between his fifth and sixth year, Draco questioned Borgin, the owner of Borgin and Burkes, on repairing the cabinet and ordered him to keep the other one safe. As a proof of his allegiance to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], Draco showed Borgin the [[Dark Mark]] now branded on his arm whilst threatening to set [[Fenrir Greyback]] to attack the shop-owner, should he disobey his commands. This meeting was also overheard by Harry, Hermione, and Ron, but while Harry started to suspect Draco of [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] activities, Ron and Hermione dismissed such possibilities, and believed Draco was merely bluffing, a choice that they would much later regret.<ref name="HBP" />

In preparation for such a dangerous mission, Draco trained and improved his own skills, and became capable of blocking jinxes [[nonverbal spell|nonverbally]]. He also became accomplished at [[Occlumency]] through the training of his maternal aunt [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], and was able to perform the very difficult [[Protean Charm]],<ref name="HBP">{{HBP}}</ref> though he could not yet produce a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]].<ref>[https://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=118 'JKRowling.com Section: F.A.Q.'] from [https://mugglenet.com/ MuggleNet]</ref>

[[File:Draco Malfoy viewing the Vanishing Cabinet HBPF.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Draco standing in front of the broken Vanishing Cabinet]]
In focus for his mission of fixing the [[Hogwarts-Borgin and Burkes Vanishing Cabinet pair|Vanishing Cabinet]], Draco experienced many visible changes in his life. He seemed to have lost interest in [[Quidditch]], and allowed (and possibly paid) [[Harper]] to take over instead. He was also becoming more neglectful in his school-work, as he missed two [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] homework assignments and received detention, as well as not attending to his [[prefect]] duties, which he would usually happily abuse as he did in the previous year. Another change was that he no longer trusted [[Severus Snape|Snape]] and was willing to speak ill towards him point-blank, no respect. 

Socially, Draco forced [[Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] to assume the forms of other people with [[Polyjuice Potion]], to help him keep watch outside the [[Room of Requirement]], while refusing to tell them anything, and seemingly to distance himself from them. Draco also spent less time mocking Harry and his friends, despite the many opportunities. Even his physical appearance showed the stress, with greying skin, weight loss and bags under his eyes. Most of this frustrated Harry, who was unable to discover exactly what Draco was up to despite his persistence and effort.<ref name="HBP" />

[[File:Draco Malfoy mirror.jpg|250px|thumb|Draco beginning to feel the strain of life as a Death Eater]]
Twice during the school year he feared he would be unable to repair the cabinet, and resorted to desperate assassination attempts, such as trying to smuggle in a cursed necklace and trying to send Dumbledore poisoned mead. Both these attempts failed and resulted in innocent people getting injured, though since they both survived Dumbledore was not forced to apprehend Draco. The stress began to affect Draco adversely, and he confessed his fears to [[Myrtle Warren]], one of the school's [[ghost]]s. On one such occasion, Harry stumbled on him. Draco reacted by starting to cast the [[Cruciatus Curse]], but Harry [[Sectumsempra|sliced his skin open with his wand]] right before he could complete the incantation. Draco was hospitalised and Harry was given detention by [[Severus Snape|Snape]] for every Saturday until the end of term.<ref name="HBP" />

[[File:Sectumsempra Draco 2.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Harry nearly killing Draco with one of Snape's spells]]
Eventually, through copious amounts of work Draco managed to repair [[Hogwarts-Borgin and Burkes Vanishing Cabinet pair|the Vanishing Cabinet]] and used it to let at least six [[Death Eaters]] into the castle: Corban Yaxley, Alecto Carrow, Amycus Carrow, Gibbon, Thorfinn Rowle, and the vicious werewolf [[Fenrir Greyback]]. Proceeding to the top of the [[Astronomy Tower]], Draco was able to corner a significantly weaker Dumbledore, disarming the latter the same instant he had, unknown to Draco, bound Harry Potter with a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]].<ref name="HBP" /> It was also at the moment when he disarmed Dumbledore that he unknowingly gained the allegiance of the [[Elder Wand]], one of the three [[Deathly Hallows]].<ref name="DH" /> 

However, when Draco was finally given the opportunity to kill Dumbledore, who had just expressed his willingness to protect Draco and his family were they to 'come over to the right side', he could not bring himself to commit murder; considering that they spent the few minutes of alone time to discuss how Draco smuggled his accomplices into the castle, Dumbledore concluded that Draco would find committing murder impossible. As predicted, Draco ultimately was unable to do it, instead lowering his wand. Snape, who had made an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa to step in if Draco failed in his task, used the [[Killing Curse]] on the [[Headmaster]]. Snape then promptly led Draco out of the school grounds, presumably to safety, but really to get to a safe distance to disapparate to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].<ref name="HBP" />

[[File:Draco disarms dumbledore.gif|250px|thumb|Draco disarming Albus Dumbledore on top of the Astronomy Tower]]
After the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], Draco could no longer return to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], as he was an accomplice, however reluctantly, in the revered Albus Dumbledore's murder, mainly by being the one who let Death Eaters penetrate the castle's walls. The official criminal status placed on him, alongside his fear of the Dark Lord's wrath, led him to seek refuge, along with his family, with Voldemort, in the hopes of satisfying his orders to prevent any more negative highlights.<ref name="HBP" />

His abrupt departure from the school left [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] surprisingly lonely, despite the two being hulking boys, as Harry described during Dumbledore's funeral.<ref name="HBP" />

====Seventh year====
=====[[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]]=====
{{Quote|I can't — I can't be sure.|Draco's refusal to identify Harry Potter in Malfoy Manor|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Malfoy Manor interrogation.gif|250px|thumb|left|Draco ambiguously recognising Harry when he was brought to Lord Voldemort's headquarters by Snatchers]]
Draco reluctantly participated in Death Eater activities before the beginning of the [[1997–1998 school year]]. Due to Draco's helpful role in Dumbledore's death, Voldemort liberated Lucius from Azkaban. He witnessed the murder of [[Charity Burbage]] and tortured [[Thorfinn Rowle]] on Lord Voldemort's orders. Judging by later remarks made by Vincent Crabbe, it seems that the Malfoys had lost much of their influence in the Death Eater circles. This is due to Voldemort no longer holding Lucius in high esteem and shifting his favour to Draco's maternal aunt Bellatrix Lestrange and Hogwarts teacher Severus Snape. When [[Thorfinn Rowle]] and [[Antonin Dolohov]] [[Luchino Caffe Duel|failed to capture]] Harry, Voldemort forced Draco to torture them via the [[Cruciatus Curse]] as punishment, with the threat of Voldemort's wrath if Draco failed to comply. Harry, who saw this scene via his mental link with Voldemort, was disgusted at what the Dark Lord was forcing the young Death Eater to commit.<ref name="DH" />

Draco attended his seventh year of Hogwarts that year. During the [[Easter|Easter holidays]], Draco was seen at home in [[Malfoy Manor]]. He was called upon by his parents and aunt [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] to confirm the identities of Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were caught by a group of [[Snatchers]] led by [[Fenrir Greyback]], but Draco showed great hesitation in doing so. When Hermione lied to Bellatrix under [[Cruciatus Curse|torture]] about [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's Sword]], Draco was sent to fetch the [[goblin]], [[Griphook]], from the dungeons to get confirmation of the story, which he did by lying saying it was a fake, but the truth was it was the true sword. Later in the evening, the prisoners managed to escape, and [[Draco Malfoy's wand|Draco's wand]] was taken by Harry. Afterwards, Draco and his family were detained to the [[Malfoy Manor|Manor]] by Lord Voldemort. Narcissa would lend Draco [[Narcissa Malfoy's wand|her wand]]; it was powerful, yet it didn't 'understand' him, as he had not won its loyalty.<ref name="DH" />

=====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]=====

[[File:Malfoy family during the Battle of Hogwarts DHF2.jpg|250px|thumb|Draco with his parents during the second-half of the Battle of Hogwarts]]
Later that same year, during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Draco, along with Crabbe and Goyle, chose to remain in the school as their fellow Slytherins evacuated in order to bring Harry Potter to Lord Voldemort. Given Lucius' previous remarks alluding to 'forgiveness', it is likely that Draco was doing this in an attempt to redeem his family in Voldemort's eyes. He along with Crabbe and Goyle followed the Trio into the [[Room of Requirement]] where he would attempt to capture Harry and retrieve the item Harry was trying to locate. However, he no longer exercised the same degree of control over his friends, particularly Crabbe, that he once had.<ref name="DH" />

[[File:Harry and Draco.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry saving Draco from Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement]]
Despite Draco telling his friends that Harry was to be brought back alive, Crabbe attempted to kill him by conjuring [[Fiendfyre]]. Since Crabbe was unable to control the curse, the Room of Requirement quickly filled with fire. Draco went out of his way to try to save both of his friends, but he only managed to get Goyle, who had been [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by Hermione during the fight, onto Ron and Hermione's broom before he let Harry fly them out. Crabbe was killed in the fire, leaving Draco very upset.<ref name="DH" />

Harry, Hermione, and Ron later spotted Draco pleading with a Death Eater that he was on his side. Harry [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] the Death Eater and Ron [[Muggle duelling|punched]] Draco and called him a <nowiki>'</nowiki>''two-faced bastard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, as this was the second time they saved his life that night.<ref name="DH" />

Although Draco was unaware of this, his act in disarming Dumbledore before his death and mastering the [[Elder Wand]] ultimately resulted in the [[Dark Wizard|Dark Lord]]'s final defeat at the hands of Harry. This is due to the fact that Voldemort was unable to fully understand the Elder Wand's power and Harry disarming Draco of his wand resulted in him mastering the Elder Wand himself.<ref name="DH" />

After Voldemort's defeat, Draco and his parents sat in the [[Great Hall]], looking uncertain of their place during the victory celebrations.<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

===After Hogwarts {{C|1998–2006}}===
[[File:Malfoys on Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Draco with his wife and son in 2017]]
The events of Draco's teenage years forever changed his life. He had the beliefs in which he had grown up challenged in the most frightening way, had experienced terror and despair, witnessed his parents suffering for their allegiance, and had witnessed the crumbling of all that his family had believed in. 

Draco and his family avoided imprisonment in [[Azkaban]] due to their last-minute switch in allegiance. [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] found his son as affectionate as ever, but refusing to follow the old pure-blood line.<ref name="PM">{{WW|draco-malfoy}}</ref>

Draco eventually married [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]], the younger sister of fellow [[Slytherin]] classmate [[Daphne Greengrass]],<ref>[https://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/0,28804,1690753_1695388_1695569,00.html TIME magazine — JK Rowling answers 10 questions about Harry]</ref> who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more accepting and tolerant way of life. This was something of a disappointment for Lucius and Narcissa, who had higher hopes of someone whose family featured on the '[[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]'.<ref name="PM" />

===Raising Scorpius Malfoy {{C|2006–}}===
[[File:Draco Scorpius.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Draco with his son Scorpius]]
The two had a son together, named [[Scorpius Malfoy]], who was raised by his mother not to believe that [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s and [[Muggle-born]]s were scum; as such, family gatherings were fraught with tension.<ref name="PM" /> Draco raised Scorpius to be a much kinder and more accepting Malfoy than he was in his youth.<ref name="PM" />

On [[1 September]] [[2017]] while sending his son off for his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Draco greeted [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] at [[King's Cross Station]] with a curt nod. The relationship between Harry and Draco was much better than it had been when they were students together, but they were still not considered to be anything at all near friends.

Independently wealthy without any need to work, Draco inhabited [[Malfoy Manor]] with his wife and son. His hobbies — which included keeping the family's old collection of [[Dark Arts|Dark]] artefacts (which he did not use and kept in glass cases) and studying [[Alchemy|alchemical]] manuscripts — were indications of his dual nature, and hint at a desire for something more than wealth.<ref name="PM" />

Draco also teamed up with his former enemies to [[Skirmish at St Jerome's Church|fight]] [[Delphini]] at [[St Jerome's Church]] in order to stop her from preventing Lord Voldemort's death.

==Physical appearance==
[[File:Draco Malfoy (HBP promo).jpg|200px|thumb|Draco Malfoy]]
Draco was a slender boy with sleek white-blond hair, cold grey eyes, a pale complexion and rather sharp, pointed features.<ref name="face" /><ref name="face2" /> He was described to have haughty good looks. As an older man, his hairline was receding, making his features look even more pointed.<ref name="DHE">{{DH|B|E}}</ref> In his first and second years his hair was slicked tightly back. Draco was noted to strongly resemble his [[Lucius Malfoy|father]] throughout his life.<ref name="DH" /> When Draco joined the Death Eaters, Lord Voldemort had the [[Dark Mark]] burned into his left forearm, which has since faded to a mere scar upon Voldemort's death.

During the first five years of school Draco maintained a relatively healthy look. However, in his sixth year onward, when the stress of his mission was getting more intense, Draco's smug countenance was lost, and he became quite thin, with dark shadows under his eyes and a greyish tinge to his skin.

As an adult, Draco let his hair grow long and started wearing it in a precisely placed ponytail.<ref>{{CC|B|1|4}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==

Well — second — [[Cedric Diggory|Diggory]] was the first —|Draco taunting [[Harry Potter]] after Voldemort's return and the murder of Cedric Diggory|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Chamber-of-secrets-draco.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Draco's arrogant demeanour]]  
Draco was, in general, an arrogant, spiteful bully for most of his early years. Like [[Dudley Dursley]], his narcissistic nature most likely stemmed from his being spoiled by his parents throughout his childhood, though according to Harry himself, Draco was even less sympathetic than his cousin. He believed himself superior to most people because of his family's pure-blood lineage as well as great wealth and social standing. He frequently behaved cruelly to Muggle-borns, blood traitors, [[Gryffindor]] students, and anyone who was a supporter of Harry Potter or [[Albus Dumbledore]]. For much of his youth, Draco took after his bigoted father, [[Lucius Malfoy]], as a role model, and frequently boasted about his family's influence and wealth.

Draco was intelligent, cunning and quick-witted, capable of deducing things and coming up with clever plans based on a small amount of information; his father had expected him to obtain top marks in school after his first year, and showed disappointment that Hermione beat him. He figured out through Montague's experience that [[Hogwarts-Borgin and Burkes Vanishing Cabinet pair|the Vanishing Cabinets]] in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and [[Borgin and Burkes]] were linked and that he could use that passage to his advantage. However, his plans could have limitations based on his own arrogance when dealing with people. When he attempted to sabotage Harry during the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw Quidditch match in their third year, his whole plan was based solely around the idea that the Dementors' appearance scared Harry, ignorant of the fact that it was the effect the Dementors had on him that caused Harry problems. Draco was also adept at compartmentalising his emotions, as is evidenced in his success with [[Occlumency]].

[[File:BroodingMalfoy.jpg|200px|thumb|Draco in his sixth year]]
However, something began to change in Draco's psyche in his sixth year at Hogwarts. After [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] made him a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], he gave Draco the task of assassinating [[Albus Dumbledore]] by the end of the year, something that Draco was very eager to do at first. After a number of feeble attempts, Draco began to crack under the enormous pressure that Voldemort was putting on him. He was uncertain of his ability to fulfil the mission and was terrified that he and his family would pay the price for his failure; the stress led him to be reckless as his two feeble attempts were noted to be foolish by Snape, and he attempted a [[Cruciatus Curse]] on Harry, despite the consequences of a life sentence in Azkaban.

Over the course of the year, the mission also led Draco to neglect other aspects of his school life that he would previously have abused or enjoyed: he rejected his Prefect duties that he once would happily abuse; he feigned illness and paid another student to take over his stead in order to avoid playing Quidditch himself, as opposed to three years earlier when he would ensure the entire match was postponed by exaggerating a minor injury in order to suit the team's interest; he missed two Transfiguration homework assignments; he would distance himself from his friends Crabbe and Goyle and order them to be on lookout without telling them anything; and he would also spend less time mocking Harry and his friends despite the many opportunities. Ultimately, Draco was unable to kill Dumbledore, lowering his wand and being tempted to take Dumbledore's offer of protection for his parents.

For the rest of the Second Wizarding War, Draco became disillusioned by the Death Eater lifestyle. He reluctantly participated in Death Eater activities and by the end of the war, remained on the fence. When [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] were captured in his home, Draco showed great hesitation in identifying them before the Death Eaters. Also, during the Battle of Hogwarts, he showed genuine concern for Crabbe and Goyle, something he rarely did.

By the time Draco become an adult, he had became a noticeably changed man, due to his regret over joining the Death Eaters and the vile deeds he had to perform, even if only limited compared to his parents, and any of his old bigotry was lost, refusing to follow in line with the old pure-blood beliefs after having seen first-hand what happened to him and his parents for that. Due to this, he fell deeply in love with [[Astoria Malfoy]] despite the disappointments of his parents over her failing to meet their hopes of someone from one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]. As a husband, Draco was very loving and devoted and was even fully willing to let the Malfoy bloodline end to protect her from her family's curse as it made childbirth dangerous and detrimental to her health, which he maintained even despite Lucius's dislike, only relenting after Astoria said she wanted to leave behind a child for him and not for family beliefs. His wisdom shone by the fact that even though the temptation of using his family's secret Time Turner to see his wife just for one more minute was admittedly great, his respect for her desires and memory were too great to risk jeopardising the timeline for his beloved, showing how deeply Draco had fallen in love with her, as even though he had the power to alter time to be with her, he was able to, even if barely, resist such overwhelming temptation, showing how much his character had changed by the age of forty.

Although [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]]'s birth would cause Astoria's death, Draco's love for his son was clearly great, considering the day he was born the greatest day of his life. Having seen how his parents spoiled him had caused him to become such a horrible man in his younger days, Draco strove to do better and henceforth he raised his son to be a better person. He did not let his histories with Harry, Ron and Hermione hamper his judgement towards Scorpius's bond with [[Albus Potter]] and crush on [[Rose Granger-Weasley]], children of his former rivals, fully supporting his son instead. His love for Scorpius was shown by how he showed no hesitation to give any Malfoy Family objects to his rivals if it would help in his son being found. In fact, he actually trusted Albus greatly, as he allowed him to connect with Scorpius when he couldn't after Astoria died, and genuinely care for the boy for what he meant to his son. Draco even went as far as to protest to Harry for having made Albus distant from Scorpius, showing how much he valued the friendship between Albus and Scorpius. Draco was more strict with Scorpius than his parents were to him, accepting that his son must be punished for having brought the wizarding world back to the times where Voldemort was in power. 

His personal relationships with his old school rivals has also changed from antagonistic to being civil and tolerating. While he continued to mock Harry's friends for them only being so popular because of Harry and didn't trust them fully with matters regarding his son, as he gave a cold reply letter to Ginny's offer to having Scorpius stay in the Potter House, particularly being enraged at them for the rumours that Scorpius was Voldemort's son, he was more than willing to team up with Harry, Ron and Hermione to save both Albus and Scorpius and worked with them effectively to dispatch [[Delphini]], despite her being the daughter of Voldemort and his aunt Bellatrix. This defiance of Delphini showed that even having the Dark Lord's daughter being a blood relative was a repugnant notion to Draco, wanting little to do with his Death Eater past, further shown by how he would attend and help his rivals in defeating what remained of the forces of darkness. By this time, Draco also began referring to Voldemort by his name rather than the 'Dark Lord' as he did in his youth due to his self-redemption. 

Draco had came to trust the luck and instincts of both Harry and Hermione, taking the orders of the Minister For Magic without hesitation, even expressing he was impressed with her battle commands, albeit in a mildly amused manner, acknowledging Harry was always ready to solve the thickest of situations, and he even went as far as to confess to Harry that he never truly craved power like his father and that his ambition was actually to become a star Quidditch player, but he wasn't good enough, and mainly he just wanted to be happy along with the truth of Astoria's death,<ref name="CC442">{{CC|B|4|4}}</ref> and his envy of Harry's friendships, as he only ever had Crabbe and Goyle, outright acknowledging Harry as a friend and showing respect for him, which was mutually returned by Harry.<ref name="CC215">{{CC|B|2|15}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
Draco was a powerful and talented [[Wizardkind|wizard]] from a young age and possessed several impressive [[magic]]al abilities. His wand was made of [[hawthorn]], which one should only ever consider placing in the hands of a witch or wizard of proven talent. Following his training from his aunt [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], Draco grew to be an accomplished wizard for his age.

*'''[[Love]]''': Although not a prominent ability for Draco, it should be noted that he was one of the few [[Death Eaters]] who was capable of genuine love. He deeply cared about both his parents to the point that he would protect and defend them when necessary, to the point that he was pushed to attempt to murder [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] in order to protect them when [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] threatened their lives after Lucius's failed [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|attempt]] to retrieve the [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]]. Despite this and his dislike for Dumbledore, he was extremely reluctant to kill Dumbledore and in the end, his love for his parents made him almost accept Dumbledore's offer to help protect them. Additionally, Draco was also extremely reluctant to identify Harry, Ron and Hermione when they were captured by the Death Eaters, despite his personal enmity with them and spent the most of the [[Second Wizarding War]] reluctantly following Voldemort's orders to protect both his family and himself. His ability to love was more prominent later on in life, giving him the strength to abandon his old prejudice against non-pure bloods and become a better person compared to his youth after seeing how much damage and devastation it caused to him and his family along with his regret over ever becoming a Death Eater. This was evident as he raised his [[Scorpius Malfoy|son]] away from that prejudice to be a better person than him and maintained a more civil relationship with his old school rivals to the point that he trusted their instincts while they searched for [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and Scorpius. He even claimed that he would have willingly ended the [[Malfoy family|Malfoy bloodline]] with himself if it meant protecting his [[Astoria Malfoy|wife]] and helped his old school rivals capture [[Delphini]] after she had threatened his son's life, even though she was the daughter of both his aunt [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and Voldemort.
[[File:The Trio (Crabbe, Malfoy and Goyle) 1991b.JPG|250px|thumb|Draco attending a [[First year|first-year]] [[Potions (class)|Potions class]]]]
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Draco was proficient in this area of magic. This could be because Snape favoured Draco and might have given him extra help in his class. Draco was able to pass his O.W.L. examination in the subject with a mark of at least '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' and most likely '[[Outstanding]]', since he was apparently not lacking a book or ingredients in Professor [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]]'s first class. When Professor Slughorn was teaching the subject, Draco seemed to have lost his edge. He was covered in 'something like [[cat]] sick' during a [[Antidote to Common Poisons|mixed antidote]] composition, and producing a 'merely passable' [[Hiccoughing Solution]]. This of course could have been due to the immense stress and anxiety Draco was feeling throughout that year.
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Draco advanced to the N.E.W.T.-level class, meaning he achieved either an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' or '[[Outstanding]]' mark on his O.W.L. exam.<ref name="HBP" /> He showed the ability to proficiently defend himself against dark magic.
[[File:DracoQuidditch.jpg|150px|thumb|Draco in his Quidditch robes]]
{{Quote|He hadn't been lying, he ''could'' fly well.|Harry admitting Draco's talent in flying|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': He was quite a fine [[Quidditch]] player and [[broomstick]] flyer. He started flying at a younger age showing his skills in his first year. He made the team as a seeker in his second year, which was a very difficult position to acquire. Although his entrance into the team is enhanced due to his father bribing the team with the new [[Nimbus 2001]] [[broomstick]]s, he also had sufficient talent, although Harry still surpassed him in pure skill despite Draco's alleged experience and superior broomstick in their first game against each other. When Draco refused to play during his sixth year, his team suffered greatly due to the fact that his replacement did a poorer job, suggesting that no Slytherin during his time was more skilful than him.
[[File:Skirmish malfoy manor.gif|250px|thumb|Draco duelling Harry and Ron during the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]]]]
[[File:Everte Statum.gif|250px|thumb|Draco Malfoy duelling Harry Potter in 1992]]
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Draco had been a very competent duellist for quite a while before starting Hogwarts, a skill probably inherited from [[Malfoy family|his parents]]. He was able to cast the [[Leg-Locker Curse]] in his first year, something [[Rubeus Hagrid]] said no first year would be able to do. The very next year, he could cast such a powerful ''[[Everte Statum]]'' that it threw [[Harry Potter|his opponent]] across the room and even while subjected to a fit of laughter caused by the [[Tickling Charm]], was able to hit Harry with the [[Dancing Feet Spell]] accurately, the round ending in a standstill as a result. He later on was able to once again match Harry in their one-move duel, casting a spell as quickly as Harry did and causing their spells to ricochet everywhere. By his [[sixth year]], having been trained by Bellatrix, Draco's duelling skills had improved to fare well against Harry, who had by the time faced much more experienced Death Eaters, delivering multiple spells nonverbally with ease and astonishing speed, something that most sixth years weren't able to do, and countering Harry's attacks, but Harry was ultimately able to cast [[Sectumsempra|a curse]] quicker than him, exploiting the brief opening left by Draco when he was preparing to use Crucio to inflict what would have been mortal damage had he not been quickly treated. He was also beaten by [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] in his fifth year and by [[Hermione Granger]] in his seventh. At the age of forty, from what he himself admitted to having been years of practice, Draco's skills had greatly improved and despite his age he remained a very formidable duelist, capable of fighting Harry, who had been the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and Auror Office for several years by the time, to a draw, managing to land and dodge spells as much as his opponent managed to land on him, although Harry had not been fighting at full capability against Draco as he had no intentions to hurt or kill him but even Harry openly acknowledged his improved skills, and helping in overpowering [[Delphini]].
[[File:Serpensortia.gif|250px|thumb|Draco casting the [[Snake Summons Spell]] in [[1992]]]]
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Draco was shown to be talented in this field from a young age, as by his second year he was already capable of [[Conjuration|conjuring]] a [[snake]],<ref name="COS" /> an advanced form of transfiguration learned in the sixth year and above, and a reasonably impressive feat even if said conjuration is rather simple. He would also successfully qualify for the [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], meaning he achieved either an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' or '[[Outstanding]]' mark on his O.W.L. exam.<ref name="HBP" /> By [[2020]], he easily used the [[Incarcerous Spell]] when duelling with Harry and was capable of aiding Hermione, Ron and Ginny to successfully transfigure Harry into a doppelganger of Voldemort, displaying his high level of skill in the area, as [[Human Transfiguration]] on the level of complete impersonation is a very demanding feat.
[[File:POA Draco in class paper bird note.gif|250px|thumb|Draco making a paper plane fly]]
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Draco was talented in charms, as by his sixth year, he was able to cast the very difficult and advanced [[Protean Charm]], something that the only known student of the same age capable of was Hermione (albeit, he was known to have mastered it one year later than she could).<ref name="HBP" /> He could cast the [[Dancing Feet Spell]], which he successfully used against Harry Potter at the Duelling Club in [[1992]].<ref name="COS" /> In [[1997]], he successfully disarmed [[Albus Dumbledore]] of the [[Elder Wand]] with the [[Disarming Charm]]. Draco was capable of casting a successful [[Shield Charm]] to block Harry Potter's spells in a duel.<ref name="HBP" /> By his seventh year, he was able to cast the [[Disillusionment Charm]] on himself to the point where Harry, Ron and Hermione could not see him and remain undetected, a highly advanced piece of [[magic]]. He was also capable of casting a [[Paper bird charm|charm]] which animates a paper bird to make it [[Levitation|fly]] like a real [[bird]]. By [[2020]], Draco displayed remarkable improvement in his skills in charm-work, making effective use of it in combat in his duel with Harry, notably able to rival Harry's [[Disarming Charm]], easily pushing a chair to block one of Harry's spells and later on stopping a chair flung at a high speed by Harry, along with being even able to use ''[[Mobilicorpus]]'' easily on Harry, making him bounce up and down on the table. Later on, he effortlessly used the [[Levitation Charm]] to levitate Delphini out of the air and out of sight and proceeded to swiftly silence her with the [[Silencing Charm]].
[[File:Attempted curse.gif|250px|thumb|Draco attempting to curse Harry Potter]]
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Draco demonstrated a proficiency for dark magic from a young age, as he was quickly capable of casting numerous [[dark charm]]s to humiliate others during his Hogwarts years, such as the [[Leg-Locker Curse]], [[Tongue-Tying Curse]], [[Knockback Jinx]], the [[hex]] ''[[Densaugeo]]'', [[Pumpkin-Head Jinx|Melofors Jinx]], [[Trip Jinx]], [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] as well as an [[Draco Malfoy's unspecified spell|unspecified dark charm]]. In this [[1996–1997 school year|sixth year]], Draco learned how to successfully cast at least two of the [[Unforgivable Curses]], the [[Cruciatus Curse]] and the [[Imperius Curse]], following his transformation into a [[Death Eaters]], allowing him to become a fully-fledged [[Dark Wizard]]. Both of these are extremely difficult and powerful dark [[curse]]s that not even many adult wizards can perform; his incredibly skilful Aunt Bellatrix might have taught him those while she was teaching him Occlumency and non-verbal spells. His Imperius Curse was strong enough to hold down [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] for almost an entire year, while he used the Cruciatus Curse to punish [[Thorfinn Rowle]]. It is possible he has the capability (but not the willingness) to perform the [[Killing Curse]] as well. Whilst duelling Harry Potter in [[2020]], he was able to swiftly and successfully perform a number of dark charms against him with ease, such as the ''[[Dangling Jinx|Levicorpus]]'' [[jinx]] along with Densaugeo and the Knockback Jinx, showing his skills in dark magic were still adept long after abandoning the Death Eaters. He even offered to be the one to disguise himself as Voldemort when he and the others went back in time to stop Delphini due to his knowledge and abilities in dark magic, suggesting he was assured he could engage in dark magic activities well enough to convince Delphini of his identity.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Draco mastered nonverbal spells before his sixth year, which included blocking [[jinx]]es non-verbally. This took a lot of skill and concentration to do and only a few in his year had done it, given the high level of difficulty and precision required in the casting of spells this way.
*'''[[Magic]]al repair''': Draco managed to repair the [[Hogwarts-Borgin and Burkes Vanishing Cabinet pair|Vanishing Cabinet]] in his sixth year with some assistance from Borgin, though it did take him the majority of the year. The cabinet was smashed by Peeves in his second year and Draco repaired it despite the fact that the magical link between the two cabinets might have been damaged.
*'''[[Occlumency]]''': In his sixth year, his Aunt [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] taught him Occlumency to prepare him for his mission. As Draco had already shut down his compassion to become the bully he was, it was much easier for him to close his mind and disassociate from his emotions. He had enough skill in Occlumency that he was able to block out Severus Snape's (a powerful Legilimens) attempts to read his mind.
*'''[[Alchemy]]''': After graduating from Hogwarts, Draco began studying Alchemy as a hobby.

==Possessions==
[[File:Malfoy's wand.jpg|222x222px|thumb|right|Draco's hawthorn [[Draco Malfoy's wand|wand]]]]

*'''[[Draco Malfoy's wand|Wand]]''': Draco's wand was 10" long, made of [[hawthorn]] [[Wand wood|wood]], and had a [[Unicorn hair]] [[Wand core|core]]. The wand was manufactured by [[Garrick Ollivander]] and was described by him as being <nowiki>'</nowiki>''reasonably pliant''<nowiki>'</nowiki>.
*'''[[Comet 260]]''': Draco owned this model of [[broomstick]] , which he owned prior to starting his first year.
*'''[[Nimbus 2001]]''': Draco's father bought the entire [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] Nimbus 2001s in exchange for his son being played as [[Seeker]].
*'''[[Dress robes]]''': Draco wore dress robes while attending the Yule Ball with [[Pansy Parkinson]] in 1994.
*'''[[Draco Malfoy's eagle owl|Eagle owl]]''': Draco owned an [[Eagle owl]], or ''Bubo bubo''. During Malfoy's first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]], the [[owl]] delivered daily packages of sweets from [[Narcissa Malfoy|his mother]].<ref name="PS9">[[1980|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]] - Chapter 9 ([[pure-blood|The Midnight Duel]])
</ref>
*'''[[Prefect badge]]''': Draco owned a Slytherin Prefect badge, which he gained after becoming a Prefect in [[1995]].
*'''[[Potter Stinks badge]]''': Draco owned one these enchanted badges during the [[Triwizard Tournament]], for the purpose of mocking [[Harry Potter]].
*'''[[Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder]]''': Draco possessed some of this magical, darkness creating powder sold by [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], which he used in 1997 to smuggle Death Eaters into Hogwarts castle.
*'''[[Hand of Glory]]''': Draco bought the Hand of Glory from [[Borgin and Burkes]] sometime after the end of his second year and before the start of his sixth, he used it to guide himself and the rest of the Death Eaters outside the [[Room of Requirement]] after he used the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
*'''[[Time-Turner]]''': Draco possessed a Time-Turner, passed down by his father. Unlike the Ministry-issued devices that were bound by a five-hour safety travel, this was a genuine device that allowed one to travel far back into the past. Also unlike the prototype possessed by [[Theodore Nott]], it was not limited by a duration stay of five minutes before returning to the present, as that one was produced with inexpensive metal. Draco kept the device as he thought of using it to see his late wife again, and Harry noted that keeping such a dangerous artefact could land him in Azkaban. Nevertheless, this Time-Turner was pivotal in saving the original timeline from [[Delphini]]'s interference.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====Parents====
{{Quote|I haven't got any options! I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!|Draco to [[Albus Dumbledore]] on Voldemort's threat to his family|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:DH-Promotional-Picture-draco-malfoy-27114107-960-1280.jpg|233x233px|thumb|left|Lucius and Draco in [[1997]]]]

[[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy]] both spoiled their only child. In [[1991]], Narcissa sent packages of sweets daily to her son. In [[1992]], Lucius bought broomsticks for the entire [[Slytherin]] [[Quidditch]] [[Slytherin Quidditch team|team]] when Draco was made [[Seeker]], and Narcissa often sent care packages to her son. She also refused to send Draco abroad to [[Durmstrang Institute]], as Lucius originally wanted, insisting he stay closer to home by attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], despite Lucius's desire to keep Draco away from the influence of Muggle-borns in Hogwarts and also because Durmstrang Institute was known to teach dark arts rather than just the defences which was why Lucius Malfoy had wanted Draco a place in that school, but, finally fulfilling Narcissa's wish for him to study somewhere not too far from home.

Lucius was colder and more demanding than his wife, criticising his son for getting lower school marks than [[Hermione Granger]] who was Muggle-born. Despite this, Draco greatly admired his father, often boasting about his influence and striving to be like him.<ref name="COS" /> Also, as Draco attempted to use his grandfather's name, [[Abraxas Malfoy|Abraxas]], to charm [[Horace Slughorn]], Draco may have had a similar level of respect for his grandfather as for his parents.

[[File:Narcissa Malfoy DH promo picture.jpg|232x232px|thumb|[[Narcissa Malfoy]], Draco's mother]]

It became clear during the [[Second Wizarding War]] that the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] cared about one another more than they cared for following [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Draco carried out the task he was assigned by Voldemort in his sixth year because his parents' lives were threatened, and appeared to be close to accepting [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s offer to keep them safe before [[Severus Snape]] interceded to kill the Headmaster.<ref name="HBP" /> During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Lucius and Narcissa did not even attempt to fight, instead frantically searching for their son. Narcissa went so far as to lie directly to Voldemort about [[Harry Potter]] being dead, in order to be allowed to return to Hogwarts and search for Draco, which also follows the saying that Harry Potter had been saved by a mother's love more than once.<ref name="DH" />

Like his parents, Draco possesses the formidable skill of [[duelling]], [[Occlumency]], and the [[Cruciatus Curse|Cruciatus]] and [[Imperius Curse]]s and is smart, quick and a smart retorter.

However, after the war, Draco's relationship with his parents may have somewhat faltered, as his marriage with Astoria led them to think she is a somewhat disappointing daughter-in-law, mainly because Astoria's change of belief after the atrocities brought by Death Eaters' ideology, something they find unfitting for a fellow member of one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]] clans. Draco himself has lost his bigotry for less-than-pure wizards, and his willingness to let the Malfoy bloodline end at himself in order to preserve Astoria's health due to her blood-bourne curse earned Lucius' dislike. Regardless, he did not lose favour of his parents, as he inherited the Malfoy Manor and Lucius' collection of artefacts (which included the 'true' [[Time-Turner]] that proved instrumental later).

====Wife and son====
[[File:Malfoys on Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.jpg|220px|thumb|Draco with his [[Astoria Malfoy|wife]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy|son]]]]
Sometime after the end of the war, Draco married [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]], whose [[Daphne Greengrass|older sister]] was in the same year as him at Hogwarts. They eventually had a son named [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]].

Draco and his wife evidently loved and cared for their son, raising him to be a better person than himself, proven when Scorpius has a crush on [[Rose Granger-Weasley]] (daughter of Draco's former rivals) and is best friend of Albus Potter (youngest son of Draco's former arch-rival) he and his wife considered the day their son was born the best day of their lives. Astoria's death has caused Draco to be heartbroken, and he even considered using the illegal 'true' [[Time-Turner]] he received from his father as a means to see her again, though he barely resisted the urge. Draco would have gladly let the Malfoy family line end with him if it were to preserve Astoria's health, disregarding Lucius' wishes, but Astoria did want to leave behind someone for her husband, not for the sake of family beliefs. Draco certainly raised Scorpius more strictly than how Lucius and Narcissa raised him, as when Scorpius was to be punished by [[Minerva McGonagall]] for utilising the Time-Turner to corrupt reality to the point of reviving Voldemort, Draco stated he was prepared to listen to how his son is to be punished.<ref name="CC44">{{CC|B|4|4}}</ref>

====Bellatrix Lestrange====
{{Quote|Ah... Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see.|[[Severus Snape]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Bellatrix Lestrange promo.jpg|230px|thumb|left|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]], his maternal aunt]]
Bellatrix Lestrange was Draco's maternal aunt, being the sister of [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]]. When Draco was younger he didn't have much contact with his aunt because she was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for torturing the [[Auror]]s [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]] (who were the parents of Neville Longbottom, a Gryffindor in the same year at Hogwarts as Draco), into insanity. However, Draco did not feel any shame in his aunt's crimes against the wizarding world law that many would label as disgraceful. After Bellatrix escaped in Draco's fifth year at Hogwarts, she fought in a [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|battle]] against [[Harry Potter]] and his friends and was the only Death Eater who wasn't captured; Draco's father, who had also fought, was imprisoned. After Draco was given a mission as a Death Eater, Bellatrix helped him and taught him [[Occlumency]], nonverbal spells, and the Dark Arts. She also thought that Narcissa should be proud that her son became a Death Eater.

In [[1997]], Bellatrix lived for some months at [[Malfoy Manor]], to be closer to Voldemort, who was also staying there. Bellatrix and Draco both participated in the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]]; Draco reluctantly watched Bellatrix's [[Cruciatus Curse|torturing]] of [[Hermione Granger]]. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Bellatrix was killed by [[Molly Weasley]]. 

It is unknown how Draco reacted to her death, but it is likely he may have felt sadness as Bellatrix seemed to have some affection with Draco. However, given that Draco and his family regretted their allegiance with Voldemort, and that Draco abandoned his prejudice against non-pure bloods after the war, it is possible his opinion on Bellatrix changed considerably as she was fanatically loyal to, and obsessively in love with, Voldemort. Also, despite [[Delphini]] being Bellatrix's daughter, Draco did not hesitate to assist in her arrest after she had threatened his son's life.

====Other family members====
[[File:Nymphadora Tonks DH promo headshot .jpg|200px|thumb|[[Nymphadora Tonks]], his maternal first cousin]]
Draco was not close to his aunt [[Andromeda Tonks]], who had been disowned for marrying [[Muggle-born]] [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]], or their daughter, his cousin [[Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora]]. Like much of the rest of his family, Draco likely held these relatives in contempt; Andromeda was considered a [[blood traitor]] and Tonks was a [[half-blood]]. In addition, Tonks had married Remus Lupin, a werewolf, which the Death Eaters scorned to humiliate Draco. Since Draco was too scared of Voldemort to respond, his feelings on the subject are unknown. Tonks referred to him as <nowiki>'</nowiki>''The Malfoy boy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, indicating she either did not know his name or despised him too much to care. Neither so much as mentioned their relation to one another. Similarly, Draco was indifferent to his first cousin once removed, [[Sirius Black]].<ref name="OTP" />

[[File:Sirius-Black-Wallpaper-sirius-black-32913977-1024-768.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Sirius Black]], his maternal first cousin, once removed]]
Both cousins were killed by Bellatrix, Sirius in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and Tonks in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] respectively. His cousin, the illegitimate child of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], his aunt, and [[Tom Riddle]], his former leader, was [[Delphini]], whom he helped Harry Potter fight in the year [[2020]], after discovering she was Voldemort's daughter, and after she tried to kill his son Scorpius. He did not have any love for Delphi, as he assisted arresting her for the murder of [[Craig Bowker Junior|Craig Bowker Jnr]].

===Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Draco|I always envied you and them, you know, Weasley and Granger. I had-|Ginevra Potter|Crabbe and Goyle.|Two lunks who wouldn't know one end of a broomstick from another.

[[File:POA Draco Malfoy's gang.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Draco Malfoy and his cohorts]]
Draco's two constant companions throughout his Hogwarts years were [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]]. Crabbe and Goyle were often involved in Draco's confrontations with [[Harry Potter]] and his friends. Though Draco often made it clear that he considered both of them rather stupid — a legitimate claim — and treated them more like lackeys than friends<ref name="POA" />, he showed genuine concern for them and the rest of his [[Slytherin|gang]] on a few occasions; when Goyle was bitten by [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]] the Rat, Draco waited for Goyle before leaving, and he also showed concern for Goyle when he was hit by Harry's Curse, when Dumbledore expressed his disgust with Draco for allowing [[Fenrir Greyback]] 'into the school where his friends live,' Draco denied knowing he would be there, clearly disturbed by the sadistic [[werewolf]]'s unexpected presence. Draco's abrupt departure from his criminal activities left Crabbe and Goyle looking oddly lonely to Harry, as Harry was used to seeing Draco in between the two hulking boys, bossing them around.

By the final confrontation between Draco and Harry in the [[Room of Requirement]], during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Draco no longer exerted much control over his friends; Crabbe, in particular, responded harshly to Draco's attempts to prevent them from killing Harry. Draco tried desperately to save both of his friends from the [[Fiendfyre|cursed fire]] Crabbe unleashed, helping pull Goyle onto Ron and Hermione's broom before letting Harry fly the two of them out, and was very upset by Crabbe's death. Although it was Ron and Hermione who saved Goyle from falling into the fire, if it wasn't for Draco who dragged Goyle to safety, Ron and Hermione would never had saved Goyle, so it can be considered that Draco saved Goyle's life.<ref name="DH" />

In [[2020]], an adult Draco admitted to Harry and [[Ginevra Weasley|his wife]] that his relationship with Crabbe and Goyle could never really have been called friendship, as they had little in common except the prejudices they had inherited from their families, and Crabbe and Goyle were far too stupid to be reliable cohorts in much.  Draco also admitted that he had always envied Harry's close friendship with Ron and Hermione, in stark contrast to the emptiness of his relationship with his two 'best friends' at Hogwarts.

===Pansy Parkinson===

I might have — er — moved on to bigger and better things.|Do you mean — [[Tom Riddle|Him]]?|Draco telling Pansy about becoming a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Pansyinfobox.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Pansy Parkinson]], his friend who had a crush on him]]

Pansy Parkinson, a [[Slytherin]] girl in Draco's year, was a close friend of Draco's at Hogwarts. She often fawned over him, laughing loudly at his snide jokes, showing great concern when Draco was injured by [[Buckbeak]] in their third year,<ref name="POA" /> and accompanying him to the [[Yule Ball]] in [[1994]].<ref name="GOF" /> Draco and Pansy were both members of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] and [[Prefect]]s in their fifth year,<ref name="OTP" /> which is indicative of their leadership roles in Slytherin House. They are noted as being particularly cosy in their sixth year at Hogwarts, seen in the [[Hogwarts Express]] with Draco's head in Pansy's lap, Pansy stroking Draco's hair, and wasted no time in vilifying Harry for (unintentionally) slashing Draco with [[Sectumsempra|a deadly curse]].<ref name="HBP" /> Sometime after this period, however, Pansy and Draco's friendship waned. Whether she was ever his girlfriend is unknown, but Draco eventually married [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]].

===Theodore Nott===
Draco was also friends with [[Theodore Nott]], one of the few people whom he considered an equal, given that Theodore was just as [[pure-blood]]ed and somewhat cleverer than him. However, Theodore was a solitary person who did not feel compelled to join any gang, including Draco's.<ref>'[https://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=5 Malfoy & Nott]' at [https://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=5 Extra Stuff] at {{JKRS}}</ref> Theodore and Draco did laugh together at Hermione's blood-status once, and Nott was also seen with Draco and his gang after Harry listed their fathers names in a Quibbler article. It is also said that they had known each other prior to their arrival at Hogwarts.

===Blaise Zabini===
He was also friends with [[Blaise Zabini]] during their sixth year, as they sat together at Hogwarts Express, where they discussed [[Harry Potter]], [[Neville Longbottom]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who had all become members of the [[Slug Club]]. Blaise was also one of the few people Draco had told about his mission, however he didn't seem to think highly of Draco's new position.
===Marcus Flint===
Draco also appeared to be friendly with [[Marcus Flint]], as shown when Flint defended Draco against Fred and George Weasley, and again when he assisted Draco and his gang in their attempts to psych Harry out during a Quidditch game by disguising as dementors. Flint however did not hesitate to shout at Draco after he failed to catch a snitch despite it flying within his reach (he was too busy making fun of Harry to notice).

===Severus Snape===
{{Quote|Sir, why don't ''you'' apply for the Headmaster job?... ''I'll'' tell Father you're the best teacher here, sir ''[...]''|Draco's opinion on Severus Snape|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

[[File:Severus Snape Profile.jpg|230px|thumb|left|[[Severus Snape]], his favourite teacher and former head of house]]

The teacher Draco initially respected the most was Severus Snape, [[Potions Master]] and [[Head of Slytherin House]]. Snape, in turn, took Draco as his favourite student and showed him undeserved lenience on several occasions, which likely had something to do with Snape's long-time comradeship with Draco's father, or on the pretext of it, given that Snape defected from the Death Eaters. Draco even stated that Snape should apply for the position of Headmaster, after Dumbledore was suspended.

However, after Lucius's imprisonment in [[Azkaban]], Draco came to resent and mistrust Snape, believing him to have usurped his father's place in the ranks of the Death Eaters, and that he was trying to take Draco's chance of glory as well. As such, Draco avoided Snape most of the year, refused any assistance, and even verbally assaulted him. However, Snape continued to protect him as when Draco was caught lurking outside of Professor Slughorn's Christmas party, and did not punish Draco when the boy refused to answer his summons to the office, something other students would not get off with so easily and which Draco took advantage of. Snape continued to protect Draco even after they fled from the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] together; when questioned by Voldemort about Draco's actions during his attempted murder of Dumbledore, Snape lied and told the Dark Lord that Malfoy hadn't lowered his wand and emphasised the young student's ability to get Death Eaters into Hogwarts as well as cornering Dumbledore, which allowed Snape to kill him. Snape's defence of Malfoy saved the boy's life and convinced Voldemort to free Lucius Malfoy from Azkaban, for which Draco reconciled with Snape.

It is unknown how Draco reacted when he learned about Snape's death by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in [[1998]], during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], or of his true loyalty to the Order of the Phoenix due to his love for the [[Muggle-born]] mother of [[Harry Potter]], [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]]. However, given Draco's own disillusionment with the Death Eater cause and subsequent rapprochement with Harry, it is likely that Draco came to sympathise with his late teacher. In addition, it is possible that Draco's aforementioned detente with Harry as adults might have been motivated, at least in part, to avoid having a similar relationship that Snape had with [[James Potter I|Harry's father]] and [[Marauders|his friends]] after their own Hogwarts years.

[[File:Harry Potter movies hbp promostills 6.jpg|230px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], his school rival and enemy turned ally and later friend]]

Draco became Harry Potter's arch-rival almost immediately after they met, just before their first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Draco was at first interested in Harry because he was so famous, but Harry was unimpressed by his arrogant manner. For the rest of their time at school, Harry and Draco loathed each other and tried to one up each other whenever possible, although Harry compared to Ron was less prone to incorporating violence on Draco. This reached its pinnacle after [[Lucius Malfoy]] was sent to [[Azkaban]] following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.

After finding out what Draco had gone through during their sixth year, Harry began to feel somewhat sorry for him, a feeling intensified by witnessing the use to which Lord Voldemort was putting him. During that year, Harry nearly killed Draco with the [[Severus Snape|Half-Blood Prince's]] curse ''[[Sectumsempra]]'' (which he used by accident, unaware of what the effects of the curse were). Harry himself felt utterly horrified and guilty at what he did.<ref name="HBP" /> However, despite their enmity towards each other, it should be noted that Draco showed great reluctance in identifying Harry and his friends when they were imprisoned in his home. In turn, Harry saved his life twice during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name="DH" /> It should be noted that the main reason behind Draco's enmity towards Harry was actually due to his jealousy of the latter.<ref name="CC">{{CC}}</ref>

{{Dialogue|Interviewer|Did Draco and Harry lose their animosity towards each other when Voldemort died?|J.K. Rowling|Not really. There would be a kind of rapprochement, in that Harry knows Draco hated being a Death Eater, and would not have killed Dumbledore; similarly, Draco would feel a grudging gratitude towards Harry for saving his life. Real friendship would be out of the question, though. Too much had happened prior to the final battle.|[[J. K. Rowling]] regarding Harry and Draco's attitudes toward each other|Bloomsbury Live Chat}}
Over the years, Draco and Harry made their peace as adults, but still were not friends by the time Scorpius and Albus started school. This later developed into a more cordial relationship due to Scorpius and Albus being best friends. Draco would grow to trust Harry's luck and instincts over the years, and knew that Harry was always in the thick of the action when it was necessary. Draco would grow to have a deep respect and friendly relationship with Albus Potter and trusted him with helping Scorpius heal from the grief of losing his mother. During the Delphini crisis, Draco would come to confess much to Harry, discussing at first in a rather distant manner, but upon revealing key details about his wife prior to and after her death as well as his family's hidden Time Turner, Draco and Harry finally came to a mutual respect for one another, and saw each other as friends for the first time, though it still did not heal everything in spite of many confessions. Draco even admitted that he had always envied Harry, Ron, and Hermione's friendship. 

Draco was first cousins, twice removed, with at least [[Charlus Potter's son|one member]] of the [[Potter family]], through the [[House of Black|Black family]]. It is almost certain that the said Potter was related to Harry, but it is unknown whether Harry and Draco were aware of it.

===Weasley family===
{{Quote|Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who ''you'' are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.|Draco to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] when they first meet|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

[[File:Weasley family.png|250px|thumb|left|The Weasley family (excluding Bill and Charlie)]]

The [[Malfoy family]] generally looked down upon the [[Weasley family]] for their lack of wealth and '[[blood traitor]]' status, a sentiment Draco made clear immediately upon meeting [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] on the train to Hogwarts for their first year.<ref name="PS" /> He and Ron had a hostility that mirrored that of their fathers, often insulting one another and prone even to physical fights at times. Draco also wrote the lyrics to the demeaning song ''[[Weasley is Our King]]'', which was meant to undermine Ron's abilities as a [[Keeper]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]].<ref name="OTP" />

When Crabbe set the [[Room of Requirement]] on fire, Ron assisted Harry and Hermione in pulling Draco and Goyle away, but with some reluctance. When he and his friends saved Draco again later that night from a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] Draco was pleading with, Ron [[Muggle duelling|punched]] him in the face and called him a 'two-faced bastard'. Although this enmity seems to have faded with age, Ron discouraged his daughter [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] from becoming friends with Draco's son, [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]].<ref name="DH" />

Draco had less interaction with other members of the Weasley family. [[Fred and George Weasley]] attempted twice to physically assault Draco; The first time was when he called [[Hermione Granger]] a 'filthy little [[Mudblood]]'<ref name="COS" /> and the second time after Draco insulted [[Molly Weasley|their mother]] and [[Arthur Weasley|father]], as well as Harry Potter's mother, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] (earning both twins, as well as Harry, a 'lifetime Quidditch ban' from [[Dolores Umbridge]]) and made sure to hex Draco, along with other members of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]], when they left Hogwarts. [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] also had a few hostile encounters with Draco, most notably hitting him with a [[Bat-Bogey Hex]] when the Inquisitorial Squad tried to hold her, Ron, [[Neville Longbottom]], and [[Luna Lovegood]] in [[1996]].<ref name="OTP" /> Draco also appeared to dislike [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] and showed no respect towards him despite the latter being a prefect.

[[File:1Harry-Potter-Half-Blood-Prince-hermione-granger-19871338-299-399.jpg|230px|thumb|[[Hermione Granger]], his former enemy and whom he used to bully]]

Draco's relationship with Hermione Granger was coloured before the two even met, although they never actually interacted until their second year. Draco was raised to believe in the inferiority of [[Muggle-born]]s, and by his second year, his father had told him he should be ashamed that Hermione beat him in all of his school marks. Thus, Draco often taunted Hermione, calling her the derogatory epithet '[[Mudblood]]', but she refused to ever be bullied. During the period when [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s [[Basilisk]] from the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was attacking Muggle-born students, Malfoy told his friends Crabbe and Goyle (really Harry and Ron using [[Polyjuice Potion]]) in the Slytherin [[common room]] that he hoped Granger would be the next victim.<ref name="COS" /> Although Hermione generally ignored Draco's taunts rather than getting into fights with him like Harry and Ron, occasionally the two would exchange sharp words and, in their third year, Hermione even slapped<!-- ATTENTION: DON'T change this to 'punched.' Within the wiki canon policy, the books supersede the films. Hermione never punched him in the book.--> him for insulting [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]].<ref name="POA" /> When he encountered the trio in [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions|Madam Malkin's]] before the start of their sixth year, he asked who had given Hermione a black eye (the result of a [[boxing telescope]]) so that he could 'send them flowers'.<ref name="HBP" /> Despite his dislike for and prejudice towards Hermione, Draco still advised [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Harry Potter|Harry]] to get her to safety during the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] riot at the [[Quidditch World Cup]] (albeit in a taunting manner)<ref name="GOF" /> and demonstrated reluctance to identify her to his aunt [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], avoiding even looking at her.<ref name="DH" /> 

In [[2017]], when Ron encouraged their daughter not to associate with Draco's son, Hermione expressed a more conciliatory attitude.<ref name="DH" /> Draco and Hermione became third cousins, once removed in law when Hermione married Ron Weasley. Draco's son Scorpius would eventually develop a deep crush and even fall in love with Hermione's daughter, Rose Granger-Weasley. Although their relationship slightly improved after the war, Draco quipped a few times during the ambush of Delphini in Godric's Hollow on 31st October 1981, that he was both astounded and mildly enjoying taking battle commands from Hermione, finding the situation darkly amusing. 

===Neville Longbottom===
{{Quote|Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than [[Ronald Weasley|Weasley]], and that's saying something.|Malfoy opinion of Neville Longbottom|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

[[File:Neville HBP 1996.jpg|thumb|left|245px|[[Neville Longbottom]], his former enemy and whom he used to bully]]The initially shy and clumsy [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] regularly found himself on the receiving end of insults from Draco and his [[Slytherin|gang]], and was often the butt of their jokes and pranks -- a fact which served only to make Neville clumsier and less confident. Encouraged by Hermione, Ron, and Harry to stand up for himself, Neville grew to be someone who was much more difficult to bully by his later years at Hogwarts, resisting not only the Slytherin students, but also [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]] and [[Severus Snape]]. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Neville proved to have made an impressive and complete turn around from his earlier years of crumbling under Draco's bullying, when he openly defied [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and beheaded [[Nagini]], effectively destroying Voldemort's final Horcrux.

Draco and Neville were fourth cousins, but both of them did not know about this relationship.

===Hogwarts staff===
{{Dialogue a-b|Albus Dumbledore|Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.|Draco Malfoy|How do you know? You don't know what I'm capable of, you don't know what I've done!|Draco and [[Albus Dumbledore]] in [[1997]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Albus Dumbledore POA promo.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his former headmaster]] 
Draco showed particular dislike for the [[Headmaster]] Albus Dumbledore, who was in favour of complete acceptance of [[Muggle-born]]s, a contradictory view to that of the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]]'. As such, Draco often ridiculed Dumbledore's ideals and choices. He was excited at first when given the mission to kill Dumbledore, with the desire to redeem his family name and avenge his father, even daring to use the derogatory term '[[Mudblood]]' in front of the Headmaster, the latter of which displeased Dumbledore. However, Dumbledore pitied Draco when he became a Death Eater, as he knew that Voldemort had forced Draco to his bidding by threatening Draco's parents. Furthermore, when Dumbledore offered to save Draco from the [[Death Eaters]], Draco seemed inclined to accept the offer before the exchange was interrupted by the arrival of his fellow Death Eaters. When Draco witnessed [[Severus Snape|Snape]] killing Dumbledore, he appeared horrified, which likely compounded his regret of ever becoming a Death Eater.

Also before his fourth year, Draco referred to Dumbledore as a [[Mudblood-lover]].<ref name="GOF" />

[[File:Dolores Umbridge Deathly Hallows promotional image.jpg|220px|thumb|left|[[Dolores Umbridge]], his former [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|D.A.D.A.]] professor]]
Accustomed to the preferential treatment he received from [[Severus Snape]], and reaping the benefits of his family's connections and status, Draco tried to use [[Abraxas Malfoy|his grandfather]]'s good name to get close to [[Horace Slughorn]], though Slughorn did little more than ignore him. However, Dolores Umbridge, who was familiar with Draco's father, made Draco and his [[Slytherin|friends]] members of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]], and was quick to allow the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] to re-form after she disbanded every other 'Student Organisation, Society, Team, Group, or Club' with [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four]].

Draco showed contempt for the teachers who lacked status or didn't fit his or his family's standards of blood purity, such as [[Remus Lupin]], who was a [[Werewolf]] and consequently tended to look ragged and poor; [[Rubeus Hagrid]], an unkempt [[half-giant]]; and [[Alastor Moody]] ([[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch, Jnr]] in [[Polyjuice Potion|disguise]]), who was an [[Auror]] known for the extensive list of Death Eaters he had captured, as well as his intense paranoia. Draco refrained from being too openly contemptuous toward the ex-auror due to fear. Incidentally, during the Ministry's smear campaign against Dumbledore, the same three teachers were cited as 'eccentric decisions' made by Dumbledore, and evidence of his diminishing competence in the position Headmaster. Draco often found himself at odds with [[Head of Gryffindor House]] [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], who never played favourites with any student, least of all Malfoy, though he showed her some level of grudging respect, while she did not accept Harry's accusations of Draco's crimes without sufficient evidence. Draco similarly seemed to feel some respect toward [[Filius Flitwick]]. Draco also disliked the caretaker [[Argus Filch]] because he was a [[Squib]] and never hesitated to punish Draco, although they did work together in the [[Inquisitorial Squad]].

===Myrtle Warren===
{{Quote|... tell me what's wrong... I can help you...|Moaning Myrtle trying to comfort Draco|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Myrtle Warren as human.png|210px|thumb|[[Myrtle Warren]]]]
During Draco's second year, when the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was opened a second time, Draco jeered to the [[Polyjuice Potion|disguised]] Harry and Ron that the first time the Chamber was opened, a [[Mudblood]] died — that 'Mudblood' being Myrtle.

During Draco's sixth year, when he was assigned by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] to kill Albus Dumbledore, he became stressed out from the difficulty of the mission and the consequences of failure. Surprisingly, despite Draco's prejudice against [[Muggle-born]]s, Draco apparently visited Myrtle regularly in a bathroom, where he confided in and even openly cried in front of her. In turn, she was under the impression that Draco was a sensitive boy who was being bullied (which was true, though Myrtle would not have known Lord Voldemort was the one bullying him). This may be one of the rare moments that Draco showed something other than disgust for Muggle-borns, though it is unknown whether he was aware of Myrtle's blood status and connection to the Chamber of Secrets' opening during Voldemort's time at Hogwarts.

===Lord Voldemort===
{{Quote|I haven't got any options! I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!|Draco regarding Lord Voldemort and the mission he's been given|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Lord Voldemort.JPG|240px|thumb|left|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], his former master and former idol turned enemy]]
Although Draco originally admired and respected Lord Voldemort, he came to fear him after having his family's safety threatened.

Draco joined the [[Death Eaters]] at age sixteen, when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] threatened to kill his parents if he failed in his mission to assassinate [[Albus Dumbledore]]. In fact, Voldemort wanted to punish [[Lucius Malfoy]] for not retrieving a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|Prophecy]] from the [[Department of Mysteries]] in his assumption that Draco would fail and have to be punished accordingly. Draco fought in several battles for Voldemort, including the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]]. After Voldemort's final defeat, Draco was not imprisoned, as he and his family had deserted the Death Eaters prior to Voldemort's defeat. 

Although it is unknown if Draco ever learnt this, it was ironically his act in disarming Dumbledore before his death and unknowingly mastering the [[Elder Wand]] which prevented Voldemort from fully mastering the wand's power. Draco, in turn, was disarmed by Harry of his [[Draco Malfoy's wand|wand]] during the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]], thereby giving Harry mastery of the Elder Wand. When Harry told Voldemort these facts, the latter simply dismissed them, arguing that they made no difference and that Voldemort threatened to 'attend to [i.e., kill]' Draco, likely as punishment not only for Draco's unintentional meddling but also for Draco's parents' disloyalty to Voldemort. Fortunately for the Malfoys, this arrogant indifference ultimately resulted in his final defeat at the hands of Harry Potter, 

By [[2020]], Draco had become so disillusioned from the Death Eater cause due to his experiences with Voldemort that he (Draco) helped the Trio defeat Voldemort's daughter [[Delphini]] in her plan to save Voldemort from [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|his first downfall]] back in 1981. What was rather remarkable about Draco's involvement in this escapade was that Delphini was the illegitimate daughter of Draco's aunt Bellatrix, and therefore Draco's cousin. This defiance of Delphini and Voldemort demonstrated that Draco wanted so little to do with his erstwhile master that even having the Dark Lord's daughter being a blood relative was a repugnant notion to him. Draco also might have been motivated by a desire to redeem himself from his Death Eater past. During this period in his life, Draco also began referring to Voldemort by his name rather than the 'Dark Lord' as he did in his youth, which might have been motivated by his self-redemption.

===Slytherin Quidditch team===
Draco Malfoy was the [[Seeker]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] starting his second year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Malfoy appeared to be very popular with the team. This is most likely because during his second year his [[Lucius Malfoy|father]] bought the team new and faster brooms. Also, the rest of the team appeared to have the [[Pure-blood supremacy|same views]] as he did because they smirked when Malfoy called [[Hermione Granger]] a '[[Muggle-born|Mudblood]]' and laughed when a curse backfired on [[Ronald Weasley]] after the disagreement with Hermione Granger.

Draco also appeared to be somehow related to one of the team members — [[Marcus Flint]] — through [[Phineas Nigellus Black|his maternal 2nd great-grandfather]], who married the [[pure-blood]]ed [[Ursula Flint|Ursula]] of the [[Flint family]].

==Etymology==
[[File:LuciusMalfoy1.jpg|200px|thumb|Draco's father and partial namesake, [[Lucius Malfoy]]]]

*Draco's name, like those of many members of his maternal family, the [[House of Black]], is derived from that of a [[Wikipedia:Draco (constellation)|constellation]]. Draco is also known as the Dragon; ''Draco'' translates into 'dragon' in Latin and 'serpent' in Greek. The constellation is connected to multiple legends in Greek mythology, most notably as symbolising the hundred-headed dragon Hercules had to get past during his [[Wikipedia:Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]], or the dragon killed by [[Wikipedia:Cadmus|Cadmus]] before he founded the city of Thebes. In Roman legend, Draco the dragon was killed by the goddess of wisdom, [[Wikipedia:Minerva|Minerva]], and tossed into the sky. Another connection with him being a Death Eater, is the fact that Lucifer/Satan is referenced as a Dragon in Christian Theology. In addition, Draco was the name of an [[Wikipedia:Draco (lawgiver)|Ancient Greek legislator]] whose laws were notoriously harsh. The word ''draconian'', meaning 'unusually severe or cruel,'<ref>[https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/draconian Dictionary.com: Draconian]</ref> is derived from his name. However, this Ancient Greek legislator simply wrote down laws that were already in existence. These harsh laws were already in existence in an oral tradition. He did not actively try to change these laws as they were written down for the benefit of the common people. This mirrors Draco's role as he introduces us to pure-blood mania, which is a philosophy he inherited from his family.
*The name Lucius may come from the Roman dictator [[Wikipedia:Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], who extra judiciously executed his rivals. His name could also be a reference to the Roman Emperor Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, also known as [[Wikipedia:Nero|Nero]]. Lucius is a name that derives from Latin meaning 'bright' or 'intelligent' and is related to the name Lucifer, the first name of Satan, which may reference Lucius Malfoy being bright but evil, or just evil.
*His surname, Malfoy, in French (mal foi) means <nowiki>'</nowiki>''bad faith''.<nowiki>'</nowiki>

*Draco is technically part French, seeing as his ancestor [[Armand Malfoy]] was from [[France]].<ref name="Malfoy family">{{WW|the-malfoy-family}}</ref>
*Technically, Draco was responsible for Harry missing two of his three Quidditch Cups at Hogwarts. In their fifth year, Harry was banned from the Quidditch Team by Umbridge for attacking Malfoy after he insulted Harry's mother and Ron's family. The second time, in their sixth year, Harry was forced to miss the final Quidditch match by Snape for using the ''Sectumsempra'' curse on Malfoy in their duel.
*The first time Draco saw Voldemort was in the [[Forbidden Forest]], when the latter was sharing a body with [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]. Draco fled from him in horror, despite the fact that his father served Voldemort in the [[First Wizarding War]]. It is presumed Voldemort did not know who Draco was at the time, or if he remembered him when he became part of the [[Death Eaters]]. Draco also probably didn't recognise Voldemort for who he was, since he was on the back of Quirrell's head, and that he was cloaked.
*Draco would have attended [[Durmstrang Institute]], a school that does not admit [[Muggle-born]]s and teaches the [[Dark Arts]], but his mother didn't want him staying so far away from home.
*Ironically enough, it was Draco's wand that Harry used in his final duel with Voldemort, though it had changed its allegiance to Harry by that point. However, as it was the rebounding spell of the Elder Wand that killed Voldemort, Draco's wand did not vanquish Riddle.
*Draco is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[Tom Felton]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]'' and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations.
**Tom provided the voice of Draco Malfoy in the video-game adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''.
*Draco is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[Alex Price]] in the Original West End production of {{CC}}.<ref name="mal">[https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/cursed-child-alex-price-interviewr|Video: Alex Price talks about playing Draco Malfoy in Cursed Child] at {{WW}}</ref>

Ahead of that, here's a sneak peek of the wonderful casts of the Cursed Child reading from the chapter 'Diagon Alley' (from Philosopher's Stone)] - {{Twitter|BloomsburyBooks|Bloomsbury UK}}</ref>
*In [[J. K. Rowling]]'s early drafts of {{PS}}, Draco's surname was 'Spungen', 'Spinks',<ref>[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/draco.html Harry Potter Lexicon: Draco Malfoy]</ref> or 'Smart'.<ref name="PM" />
*Draco's wand is notable in that his wand is one of the few that have the same look throughout all eight films, though the prop in the last two films is all black instead of brown with a black handle.
*Rowling has expressed some worry over fans of Draco: 'People have been waxing lyrical [in letters] about Draco Malfoy, and I think that's the only time when it stopped amusing me and started almost worrying me. I'm trying to clearly distinguish between Tom Felton, who is a good-looking young boy, and Draco, who, whatever he looks like, is not a nice man. It's a romantic, but unhealthy...'<ref name="JKR" />
*In {{COS|FA}}, Draco does notice the Golden Snitch just after Harry does and chases after him for it only to get knocked off his broom and injured unlike the book where he never noticed it because he wasn't paying attention to his surroundings. Also for the film, Draco's injuries cause him to be sent to the Hospital Wing, though [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] impatiently tells him that his injuries were not severe enough to be kept overnight.
*In the {{POA|FA}}, Draco's arm injury does not last as long as it does in the book.
*It is shown that he is somewhat more respectful in the films than the books. In {{GOF|FA}}, Draco is seen at [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory|Cedric's memorial feast]]. However, instead of talking and disrespecting the feast, he is seen looking down solemnly, mourning for Cedric.
*In the films:
**Draco seems to be less antagonistic towards Hagrid than in the books.
**Draco seems to have a fondness for green apples, since he is seen eating one in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' and putting one in the vanishing cabinet in ''Half-Blood Prince''.
*In {{DH|F2}}:
**Draco receives a hug from Voldemort and is the only known follower of his to receive this 'honour'. This scene was improvised by both actors, adding the 'awkward' element.
***This atmosphere actually makes sense, as Voldemort had never known love, and this act of hugging would seem strange to him.
**In the final climatic battle, he and his family depart from the battle and were not seen in the [[Great Hall]] during the recovery from the battle.
*In the video game adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'', Draco appears to give his wand back to Harry to duel with Lord Voldemort. This was also filmed for the film, but it was cut.
*He never referred to Ron or Hermione by their first names during the course of the original seven books. He did, however, refer to both of them by their first names by the events of The Cursed Child.

===Author's comments===
{{Quote|He's shut down compassion — how else would you become a Death Eater? So he suppresses virtually all of the good side of himself. But then he's playing with the big boys, as the phrase has it, and suddenly, having talked the talk he's asked to walk it for the first time and it is absolutely terrifying.
