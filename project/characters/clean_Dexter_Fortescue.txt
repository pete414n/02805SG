'''Professor Dexter Fortescue''' was a [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was particularly informed on the history of the [[Elder Wand]] and [[Ravenclaw's Diadem]], the knowledge of which he passed to later generations of [[Fortescue family|his family]].



Dexter Fortescue was made [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in an unknown time period, certainly sometime after the early [[18th century]]. During his life, he was well-informed on the [[Elder Wand]] and [[Ravenclaw's Diadem]]: information that he later passed down to future generations of the [[Fortescue family]], eventually reaching [[Florean Fortescue]]. After his death, his portrait was hung at the [[Headmaster's office]], in order to offer advice to the current Head.


1995

Shortly after [[Arthur Weasley]] was attacked by [[Nagini]] at the [[Department of Mysteries]] in [[1995]], Professor [[Albus Dumbledore]] attempted to wake up the portrait of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] to tell [[Sirius Black]] that [[Harry Potter]] and the [[Weasley family|Weasley]] children were going to [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. As Phineas expressed unwillingness to help, the portrait of Dexter Fortescue was particularly vocal, as were [[Armando Dippet]] and a portrait of a [[Gimlet-eyed Hogwarts Headmistress|gimlet-eyed Headmistress]].



In [[1995]], he roared his disapproval at [[Cornelius Fudge]] and [[Dolores Umbridge]] when the latter explained to the former how she had learned of the first meeting of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in the [[Hog's Head]]. She explained that [[Willy Widdershins]] had been there and had reported back. [[Minerva McGonagall]], also present, commented that she had wondered how Willy had gotten off so lightly after all those [[Regurgitating Toilet]]s, and Fortescue erupted, saying that they did not cut deals with petty criminals in his day.

1998
When [[Harry Potter]] went to the [[Headmaster's office]] shortly after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Voldemort's Last Stand|defeat]] and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Fortescue joined the ovation made by the previous [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Headmaster portraits|Headmaster]], waving him his ear trumpet.


Professor Fortescue was described as a corpulent, red-nosed wizard.


Fortescue believed in honour and duty, reprimanding Phineas Nigellus for "dereliction of duty" and bellowing at Cornelius Fudge, Dolores Umbridge, [[John Dawlish]], and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] for cutting deals with petty criminals.

In life, he was hard of hearing, necessitating the use of an ear trumpet before his death. This trait was passed along to his portrait, which used it to listen to private conversations in the Headmaster's office and speaking loudly when addressing observers or other portraits.


*[[J. K. Rowling]] has confirmed on  that [[Florean Fortescue]], who ran an [[Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour|ice cream parlour]] in [[Diagon Alley]], is one of his descendants.


The name "Dexter" comes from an occupational surname meaning "one who dyes" in Old English. It also coincides with the Latin word ''dexter'' meaning "right-handed, skilled".
