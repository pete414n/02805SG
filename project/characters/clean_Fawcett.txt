'''S. Fawcett''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1990s]]. She lived with her [[Fawcett family|family]] near [[Ottery St Catchpole]].



In [[1992]], she attended the [[Duelling Club (1990s)|Duelling Club]] set up by [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] and received a minor injury. She was probably paired up with another student and started [[duelling]] like everyone else.


In [[1994]], she did not attend the [[Quidditch World Cup]], because her family couldn't get tickets. This suggests that she was a [[fourth year]] or above, as she was able to attend the Yule Ball, unless she was invited by Stebbins (just like [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] was invited by [[Neville Longbottom]] as she didn't have the proper age to attend the Yule Ball at that time); but given that Fawcett and Stebbins were caught together in the rose garden, they might have met each other for a time; they might have been the same age and started attending Hogwarts the same year.

Sometime during her time at the school, she borrowed the [[Hogwarts Library|library]] copy of , and was due to return it on [[16 September]].


*Fawcett was portrayed by [[Alex Argenti]] in , but her scenes were cut from the theatrical version, but appeared in a deleted scene on the DVD of the film. In the scene, she and [[Stebbins (Potter-era)|Stebbins]] are not caught by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] in the rose bushes, but in a [[Hogwarts Carriages|Hogwarts carriage]] parked in the [[Viaduct Courtyard|Entrance Courtyard]].
**However, in some television showings, this scene is in the actual film.
*In the [[Great Britain|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Russia]]n, [[Poland|Polish]], and [[Denmark|Danish]] editions of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', when Snape catches Fawcett with Stebbins in chapter 23, he says, "Ten points from [[Hufflepuff]], Fawcett! And ten points from [[Ravenclaw]], too, Stebbins!", although Fawcett is referred to as a Ravenclaw by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in chapter 16. The American edition of the novel amends this error, with Snape taking Fawcett's points from Ravenclaw, and Stebbins' from Hufflepuff. In the ''Goblet of Fire'' film, however, Snape makes a similar error where he refers to Fawcett as a Hufflepuff and Stebbins as a Ravenclaw. The only way it couldn't be a mistake is that Snape mentions the consequences of the partner's rule-breakings.
