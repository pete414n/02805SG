The name "Everard" means "brave boar", derived from the Germanic elements eber, "wild boar" and hard, "brave", "hardy". The Normans introduced it to England, where it joined the Old English cognate Eoforheard. It has only been rarely used since the Middle Ages. Modern use of the name may be inspired by the surname Everard, itself derived from the medieval name.
