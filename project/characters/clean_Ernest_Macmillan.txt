'''Ernest "Ernie" Macmillan''' (b. [[1980]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1991]]-[[1998]]. He was in the same year as the famous [[Harry Potter]] and was sorted into [[Hufflepuff]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. He was also born into the Macmillan family, one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]].

Ernie was an academically strong student and good friends with [[Hannah Abbott]] and [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]]. In [[1992]], Ernie initially suspected that [[Harry Potter]] was the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]] during the opening of the [[Chamber of Secrets]] in his Second year.

In Ernie's fourth year, their friendship temporarily wavered after Harry's name came out of the cup after Hufflepuff's [[Cedric Diggory]]. He thought Harry cheated and proceeded to wear Potter stinks badges, courtesy of [[Draco Malfoy]]. When Harry proclaimed that Voldemort had returned at the end of the year Ernie was one of the few who believed him.

In his fifth year, Ernie became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by Harry for the purposes of learning practical defensive magic. He joined the D.A. again when it was reinstated during his seventh year, opposing [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] control of Hogwarts and fighting in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on the [[2 May]], [[1998]].

It remains unknown what happened to Ernie after the [[Second Wizarding War]], but he likely survived as his name wasn't listed among the [[List of deaths|casualties]]. What Ernie did after the war, if he survived, is unknown.





Ernie was born into a [[pure-blood]] [[Macmillan family|family]] that could trace its lineage back nine generations; he may have been related to [[Melania Macmillan|Melania Black]] , [[Sirius Black]]'s paternal grandmother, a pure-blood family, which references to both his surname and blood heritage. Although he was proud of his blood status, Ernie was not prejudiced against those of other [[blood status]]es, befriending and looking out for [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], a [[Muggle-born]].


First year


Ernie began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September]], [[1991]]. He was in the same year as the famous Harry Potter. He was also [[Sorting Hat|sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]], which valued characteristics such as loyalty, friendship, and hard work. 

During the [[Welcoming Feast]] he soon became friends with fellow Hufflepuff students [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Susan Bones]], and [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and stayed friends with them through out the entire school year.

At some point during or after his first-year, he once borrowed  from the [[Hogwarts Library]], and was due to return the book on [[12 August]].

Second year




During his [[1992–1993 school year|second year]], Ernie came to believe that [[Harry Potter]] was the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]], after he spoke [[Parseltongue]] in front of the entire [[Duelling Club]]. In actuality Harry was trying to stop the [[snake]] [[Snake Summons Spell|conjured]] by [[Draco Malfoy]] from attacking [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]]. However, Ernie perceived it differently. He believed that Harry was in fact urging the snake to attack instead. He showed bravery when he stepped in to protect his friend, suggesting that he should hide in their common room and stay there until the coast was clear.

s, while gossiping about Harry Potter]]

Ernie went into discussion with the other Hufflepuffs regarding if Harry was the heir of [[Slytherin]], considering the coincidences with the victims. He voiced that being a Parselmouth was the very symbol of a Dark wizard and was probably the reason why [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] wanted to kill Harry, Voldemort did not want another Dark Lord competing against him. Harry, who was attempting to explain to Justin what really happened, was eavesdropping on their conversation and attempted to convince Ernie that the altercation at the [[Duelling Club]] was not what it seemed. Ernie stated that Harry should not try anything, as he himself was [[pure-blood]] and also brought up the fact that Harry hated his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] relatives. When it seemed that their argument was going nowhere, Harry eventually gave up.

Soon enough, Ernie's fears worsened when Justin was [[Petrification|petrified]]. He discussed the matter with their mutual friend Hannah, who was initially sceptical because she thought Harry was nice, but was eventually persuaded to Ernie's point of view.

However, [[Hermione Granger]], one of Harry's best friends, was later petrified as well. This made Ernie realise that Harry could not be the Heir of Slytherin, as he knew Harry would never harm Hermione, and he gave Harry a public apology. He believed that Malfoy could be the culprit, but Harry gave an emotionless no, making Ernie and Hannah stare.

Third year
In his [[1993–1994 school year|third year]], Ernie took many subjects similar to Hermione. He once told [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] that she had never missed a [[Muggle Studies]] lesson, despite having another class at exactly the same time that she also attended. This was due to Hermione's use of a [[Time-Turner]] to attend all her lessons.

Fourth year


In the summer of [[1994]], Ernie and his family attended the [[Quidditch World Cup]] final between [[Irish National Quidditch team|Ireland]] and [[Bulgarian National Quidditch team|Bulgaria]]. Whilst there a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Reappearance of the Dark Mark|raid]] ensued, resulting in chaos amongst those attending.

Ernie's fourth year held place to the [[Triwizard Tournament]], which was hosted at Hogwarts that year. He supported fellow Hufflepuff [[Cedric Diggory]] when he qualified and again stopped speaking to Harry Potter, who also qualified, but underage, as he was one of many students who initially believed that Harry had entered himself into the tournament in a bid for further glory. He tried to convince his friends in Hufflepuff to agree with him, but they needed not much convincing.

 harassing Harry Potter with their badges]]
He also wore a ''[[Potter Stinks badge|Support Cedric Diggory/Potter Stinks]]'' badge. Ernie and other Hufflepuffs frequently harassed Harry Potter with their badges, even though Cedric asked them not to. However, he likely wore off wearing this badge after Cedric requested his housemates to stop wearing them after the first task.


After the tournament came to a close, Cedric Diggory was [[Killing Curse|murdered]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], coming as a shock to all students and staff members. Ernie attended Diggory's memorial feast, as did his friends. Diggory was a member of [[Hufflepuff]] and since Harry was with him when he died, Ernie appeared to have forgotten any ill wishes he thought of Harry and believed his claims to Voldemort returning whilst the Ministry did not. Ernie was among the very few students that did believe Harry's account of Voldemort's [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]].

Fifth year

In [[1995]], Ernie became a Hufflepuff [[prefect]], alongside [[Hannah Abbott]]. Unlike previous years, during which he had thought ill of Harry for certain acts he believed him to have committed, Ernie was one of the few Hogwarts students who believed Harry's story that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned. He even went as far as to make an openly public declaration of support on Harry's behalf.

]]
Shortly after the beginning of term, Ernie joined Dumbledore's Army because of his belief in Harry and because of his dismay with Dolores Umbridge, a [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] employee who became [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor but refused to teach students any practical defence. Ernie believed Dumbledore's Army to be one of the most important things they would be doing that year — apart from [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]]. 

In the run-up to his examinations, he would study between eight and ten hours a day. He developed the irritating habit of boasting about this fact, then inquiring about other students' study habits.

When Headmaster Albus Dumbledore was forced to flee the school after the D.A. was discovered, [[Umbridge family|Umbridge]] took his place as Head of the school. However, [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] itself refused to recognise her authority and sealed the [[Headmaster's Tower]] against her, prompting her to throw what was referred to as a "''right little tantrum''". This act was witnessed by the [[Fat Friar]], Hufflepuff's house ghost, who told Ernie about it and who in turn relayed it to Harry, Ron and Hermione. Unfortunately, this happened to be overheard by Draco Malfoy and several other [[Slytherin]]s who had joined Umbridge's newly-formed Inquisitorial Squad.

]]
When Malfoy stated that he would have to dock points from [[Hufflepuff]] and Gryffindor, Ernie immediately contradicted him by stating that fellow Prefects had no authority to do so. However he was overridden by the Squad's new powers and his contradiction was used as an excuse to dock five points from Hufflepuff, much to Ernie's mingled shock and fury. When [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] implied that they were going to cause some trouble in the school, Ernie looked uncomfortable and made an excuse about some unfinished [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] homework so he wouldn't be associated. In June, Ernie and the other fifth years took their Ordinary Wizarding Levels. Erie was most likely present when Harry had a vision during their History of Magic O.WL.  

After term had ended, Ernie was one of the members of the D.A. who helped foil an ambush on Harry by [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Vincent Crabbe]], and [[Gregory Goyle]] on the [[Hogwarts Express]], cursing them so vociferously that they were reduced to three gigantic [[slug]]s in Hogwarts robes. Ernie and Justin then helped hoist them into the luggage rack to ooze out the journey, taking particular pleasure in doing so as revenge for the points Malfoy had unfairly docked from Hufflepuff.

Sixth year


Ernie's hard work and determination from the previous year paid off. He was the only Hufflepuff student in his year who reached the required level to advance to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T]] Potions. Ernie earned at least an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' on his O.W.L. exam, something [[Severus Snape]] claimed was very hard to achieve. Ernie had also qualified for N.E.W.T-level [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], most likely because of Harry Potter's teaching the previous year.

Ernie also attended Apparition lessons with his fellow students and during the first lesson he did a leap into his hoop. An action that had both [[Dean Thomas]] and [[Seamus Finnigan]] roaring with laughter at his expense.

Later in the year, Death Eaters invaded Hogwarts, Dumbledore's Army was called to battle and the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] broke out. It was likely Ernie never received his D.A. signal, as he had left the [[Hufflepuff Basement|Hufflepuff Common Room]] to investigate a disturbance he had heard when he saw [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Severus Snape]], and [[Harry Potter]] running down a corridor. He asked Harry what was going on, but got no response save for two of his housemates getting knocked aside. 

He would later discover that [[Albus Dumbledore]] had been killed that night by Snape, and then presumably attended his funeral several days later to pay his respects.

Seventh year

]]
As a [[pure-blood]], Ernie was able to return to Hogwarts for the 1997-1998 school year after the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] fell under Lord Voldemort's control; indeed, Hogwarts attendance became mandatory. Presumably, Ernie's [[Muggle-born]] friend [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]] was not able to come back to school, though [[Hannah Abbott]] returned.

Ernie and Hannah joined the revived [[Dumbledore's Army]], which was led by [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], and Luna Lovegood in the absence of [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], who were off hunting down Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es. 

The D.A. members opposed the anti-[[Non-magic people|Muggle]] propaganda and [[Dark Arts]] taught by Death Eater professors [[Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] and [[Amycus Carrow]]. They painted rebellious phrases on the walls and freed students from detention, where they faced beatings and even the [[Cruciatus Curse]].

Battle of Hogwarts
|250px|alt|left]]

On [[2 May]], [[1998]], Harry, Ron and Hermione returned to Hogwarts as Voldemort approached with his army. A meeting was held in the [[Great Hall]], and when [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] laid out the plans to evacuate the younger students from the school, Ernie indicated his willingness to fight against the [[Death Eaters]]. He did this by directly asking McGonagall about those who wished to remain behind. His question was applauded by a number of students who held similar feelings.

During the subsequent battle, Ernie, along with [[Luna Lovegood]] and [[Seamus Finnigan]], came to the aid of Harry, Hermione, and Ron by using their [[Patronus Charm|Patronuses]] to drive off a group of [[Dementor]]s. Ernie's took the form of a [[Wikipedia:Boar|boar]].


Ernie's later life is unknown. It can be assumed that he survived the final battle of the [[Second Wizarding War]] as his name wasn't mentioned amongst the casualties.


Ernie Macmillan was described to be a stout-looking boy with blondish hair. When concentrating, such as during [[Apparition (class)|Apparition lessons]], his face would go a deep shade of pink. Being stout implied that he was on the chubbier side, or was, at least, heavier than the average student.




Despite being somewhat pompous, Ernie was loyal to his friends and always honest, traits of a true [[Hufflepuff]]. He would usually shake Harry's hand in a portentous manner and speak in a somewhat ostentatious and presumptuous manner. He was never afraid to speak his mind, and could readily admit when he was wrong. As a student, he was hard-working and strived to get good marks, which was particularly evident in his fifth year, when he claimed to be revising for his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.Ls]] around nine hours a day.

Ernie did however seem to have a habit of jumping to conclusions regarding [[Harry Potter]]; in his second year, he believed and ultimately spread a rumour that Harry was the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]]. During his fourth year, Ernie made his disapproval of Harry's participation in the [[Triwizard Tournament]] as an illegal fourth champion clear, claiming Harry had done it to steal the spotlight from Hufflepuff.

Despite being a [[pure-blood]] and proud of it, Ernie never displayed any prejudice towards those of different [[blood status]], as many other pure-bloods did. In fact, his two closest friends at Hogwarts were a [[Muggle-born]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], and a [[half-blood]], [[Hannah Abbott]], and he looked out for both of them throughout his studies. His friendship with both of them technically made him a blood traitor by association, which may contradict on how proud he was of his wizarding lineage, or he may simply not care who he associated with. Ernie was also one of the first to openly express his support of Harry and [[Albus Dumbledore]] during the Ministry's [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|smear campaign]] against them.

*'''[[Potion]]s''': Ernie was proficient in the [[magic]]al art of potion-making. He achieved either an '[[Outstanding]]' or an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' on his O.W.L. exam. In [[1996]], he was only one of twelve students who were able to advance to N.E.W.T.-level. He was also the only [[Hufflepuff]] who advanced.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Ernie was shown to be proficient with charms. He was experienced with the casting of the [[Shield Charm]].
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Ernie earned an O.W.L. in this subject, because of his association with [[Dumbledore's Army]]. He advanced to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level in this subject. He was able to cast the [[Shield Charm]] during the DADA during his sixth year. This proficiently was due to his experience in the D.A.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Ernie demonstrated himself to have been a highly capable duellist. He was educated in [[Martial magic]] while in Dumbledore's Army. He and several others were able to [[hex]] [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Gregory Goyle]], and [[Vincent Crabbe]] into [[slug]]s at the end of their fifth year. In his seventh year, he bravely fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Death Eaters]]. Ernie most likely survived the battle, as he was not mentioned as a casualty.


*'''[[Wand]]''': Ernie owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. Being a British wizard, he likely purchased it from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]], [[London]], prior to starting his [[first year]] at Hogwarts in [[1991]]. Ernie wielded his wand throughout his school life, and was able to perform powerful [[magic]] with it, and used to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]].
*'''[[Prefect badge]]''': Becoming a Hufflepuff [[Prefect]] at the start of the [[1995–1996 school year]], Ernie would have owned and wore a Hufflepuff Prefect badge.
*'''[[Potter Stinks badge]]''': Ernie owned and wore one of these derogatory enchanted Badges in [[1994]], to show his disdain towards Harry Potter for supposedly stealing [[Cedric Diggory]]'s limelight during the [[Triwizard Tournament]] that year. He stopped wearing his badge once he became a strong supporter of Harry during the Tournament.



, his good friend]]
Ernie and Hannah Abbott were close friends during their time at Hogwarts, having both been sorted into the house of Hufflepuff. They discussed the possibility of Harry being the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]] together during their second year, and Hannah appeared easily influenced by Ernie's opinion. 

Both Hannah and Ernie shared the hobby of collecting [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s, like most of the students at Hogwarts. They both also strongly supported [[Cedric Diggory]] as the School Champion during the [[Triwizard Tournament]], and in 1995 they both became the Hufflepuff [[prefect]]s in their fifth year.

Later, in the 1995-1996 year, both Ernest and Hannah Abbott joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and were active members of the organisation. They also fought together in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], it can be assumed that they remained friends after the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Ernie might have even attended Hannah's and Neville Longbottom's wedding. 


, his good friend]]
Ernie's other closest friend was Justin Finch-Fletchley. During the Duelling Club in [[1992]], he moved to protect his friend when it seemed that [[Harry Potter]] was encouraging a snake to attack him. Believing Harry to be the Heir of Slytherin, and that Justin was his next target, he told Justin to hide in the dormitories. When Justin later turned up [[petrification|petrified]], Ernie was very upset and angry with Harry until convinced that he was not the culprit behind the attack on his friend.

Later, in the 1995-1996 year, both Ernest and Justin Finch-Fletchley joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and were active members of the organisation.



, his friend]]
During the [[Chamber of Secrets]] affair, Ernie held the suspicion that Harry Potter was the Heir of Slytherin when he saw him speak [[Parseltongue]] to a snake during the Duelling Club, and believed he was encouraging it to attack [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]]. His suspicions were raised when Justin became the next victim of "[[Serpent of Slytherin|''Slytherin's Monster'']]". However, when [[Hermione Granger]] suffered the same fate, Ernie realised that it could not be Harry since he would never harm one of his best friends. To make amends, Ernie gave Harry a public apology.

Despite generally getting along well, Ernie did follow the lead of his fellow [[Hufflepuff]] housemates and give Harry the cold shoulder when he was selected as the fourth [[Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Champion]] in 1994. Since [[Cedric Diggory]] had been the chosen [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] Champion, he felt, like many others in the school, that Harry was taking away Hufflepuff's chance for honour and glory. 

However, with the tragic events surrounding the Third Task, Ernie believed Harry's story that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned and publicly proclaimed his support despite the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' calling him a liar. Ernie's support of Harry was so strong that he was a staunch supporter of [[Dumbledore's Army]], and led the call to arms during the meeting of students in the Great Hall prior to the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].



*Ernie was born between April 21st and September 1st, as like [[Harry Potter]] and [[Draco Malfoy]], he was unable to take the [[Apparition (class)|Apparition test]] with the rest of his [[sixth year]] class due to not yet being of-age.
*Ernie was played by [[Louis Doyle]] in the 2002's film adaption of  and returned three years later for 2005's . Louis Doyle also provided the voice for the character in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of . In , he is portrayed by [[Jamie Marks]].
*Ernie's last name was misspelt in the closing credits for ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets]]'' as "MacMillan", but was corrected for ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.
*In , Ernie's last name is misspelt as "McMillan".
*In , Ernie's role is diminished to a non-speaking part. The part where he and Hannah Abbott talk in the library about their theory of Harry wanting to attack Justin Finch-Fletchley was cut, but appears on the deleted scenes.
*In , Ernie is omitted. However, one of his lines is spoken instead by [[Katie Bell]].
*Ernie is likely full or part Scottish, as his surname of Macmillan is a fairly common Scottish surname.
