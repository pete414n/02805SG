'''Adrian Pucey''' (born c. [[1977]]â€“[[1979]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who likely began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1989]] or [[1990]]. He was a member of [[Slytherin]] house, and was a [[Chaser]] on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]].



Adrian Pucey likely began attending Hogwarts in 1989 or 1990 and was sorted into the [[Slytherin]] house. He made it onto the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] and played the role of [[Chaser]].

Adrian was on the [[Slytherin]] team in [[Harry Potter]]'s first year up to and including his fifth year (except for the third year, when [[Marcus Flint]], [[Cassius Warrington]] and [[Graham Montague]] are said to be the three Chasers); hence, he was no more than two years ahead of Harry, assuming that he did not need to repeat a year, like Marcus Flint.


He was notable for being one of the few Slytherin Quidditch players who was not seen to commit a foul or otherwise cheat, despite being on the Quidditch team for at least three years.


*Adrian Pucey was played by [[Scot Fearn]] in the first two films, but due to a series of errors in the closing credits of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Philosopher's Stone]],'' he was listed as having played [[Terence Higgs]] (his name was additionally misspelled as "Scott Fern" therein), while [[David Holmes]] was wrongly credited as Pucey and [[Will Theakston]] (Higgs) as Marcus Flint. These errors were corrected in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', though both Fearn's and Jamie Yeates' names contained spelling errors.


*The name  is derived from the Roman name ''Hadrian'', who was an emperor of Rome who gave his name to Hadrian's Wall in England. Adrian means "from Adria", a port on the Adriatic Sea, and was the regnal name of the first and only English pope, Adrian IV.
*Pucey may be from puce, a deep red to dark greyish purple, and from the French word for "flea".
