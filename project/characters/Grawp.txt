{{Quote|[[Hermione Granger|HERMY]]! WHERE HAGGER?|Grawp calling out for his brother [[Rubeus Hagrid]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Grawp''' (b. post [[1931]]) was a [[giant]] that was known for his small stature and short height; although he stood at sixteen feet tall, this was considered short by giant standards.<ref name="OP30" /> He was the son of [[Fridwulfa]] and an [[Grawp's father|unnamed giant]] and, therefore, the maternal half-brother of [[Rubeus Hagrid]].<ref name="OP30" />

==Biography==
===Early life===
Around [[1931]], the [[giant]]ess [[Fridwulfa]] abandoned her human husband [[Rubeus Hagrid's father|Mr Hagrid]] and their infant child [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. Rubeus was was a half-gaint and therefore smaller in stature than she wanted at ten feet tall.<ref name="OP30" /> She consequently rejoined her own kind in the mountains, and there she found a new mate.<ref name="OP30" /> 

The two gave birth to the giant Grawp who was a full-blooded giant, but still particularly small  for a giant. Due to his small stature he was abandoned as well.<ref name="OP30" /> He was frequently bullied by the other giants thereafter due to his small size.<ref name="OP30" />

===[[1995]]===
{{Quote|Well, tha's why it took so long, see. Could on'y travel by nigh' an' through wild country an' stuff. Course, he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter, but he kep' wantin' ter go back.|Hagrid and Grawp's difficult journey to Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[Rubeus Hagrid]], along with his newly-found friend [[Olympe Maxime]], paid a visit to a [[Giant colony|tribe of giants]] in June of 1995, on the orders of headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in an attempt to bring the giants over as allies of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] in the war against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="OP20">{{OOTP|B|20}}</ref>

After three days at the giant camp, Hagrid discovered his half-brother Grawp. He later dragged Grawp back to [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] with him due to the bullying he knew Grawp had received, and presumably to protect Grawp from Voldemort's enslavement of the giants.<ref name="OP30" /> Despite his previous abuse, Grawp continuously attempted to return to the camp, but Hagrid forced him through [[England]] against his will.<ref name="OP30" />

Hagrid kept Grawp in the [[Forbidden Forest]] for months, teaching him manners and pieces of English as they went.<ref name="OP30" /> The other inhabitants of the forest, namely the [[centaur]]s, noticed these attempts and tried to warn Hagrid that his trial was futile.<ref name="OP27">{{OOTP|B|27}}</ref> 

===[[1996]]===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Hagrid|Hermione, I couldn' leave him. See — he's my brother!|Harry Potter|Hagrid, when you say 'brother', do you mean — ?|Well — half-brother. Turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad, an' she went an' had Grawp here —|Grawp?|Yeah... well, tha's what it sounds like when he says his name. He don' speak a lot of English.... I've bin tryin' ter teach him.... Anyway, she don' seem ter have liked him much more'n she liked me.... See, with giantesses, what counts is producin' good big kids, and he's always been a bit on the runty side fer a giant — on'y sixteen foot —|Discussion of Grawp's origins|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[File:Hagrid introduces the trio to Grawp.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hagrid introducing Grawp to Harry and Hermione]]

During a [[Quidditch]] match in 1996, in which [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] played as [[Keeper]], Hagrid secretly revealed Grawp's presence to [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]], asking them to look after Grawp in case he got sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]], who was strictly against half-breeds as well as creatures like giants. Despite their disapproval of Grawp's presence, they agreed in the end.<ref name="OP30" /> After Hagrid was later temporarily sacked by Umbridge, Grawp became upset about his absence and after chasing the [[Forbidden Forest Centaur colony|centaurs]] away from Harry and Hermione before they could attack them, demanded about Hagrid's presence from Hermione, who responded that she didn't know where he was.<ref name="OP33" />

After [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s return and Umbridge's sacking from Hogwarts, Grawp was later reunited with Hagrid and was later sent by Dumbledore and Hagrid to live in the mountains near [[Hogsmeade]], presumably in the [[Cave near Hogsmeade|cave]] where Hagrid hid after his sacking by Umbridge, with Hagrid commenting he was far happier there than in the Forest. Hagrid additionally considered getting a female giant for Grawp to socialise with, something Harry usually would have protested against but was unable to do so due to his grief over [[Sirius Black]]'s death.<ref name="OOTP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>

Grawp also proved to be an indirect factor to Harry, Ron and Hermione discontinuing [[Care of Magical Creatures]] once they began their sixth year as they disapproved of Hagrid's idea to train Grawp to be his teaching assistant alongside Hagrid's tendancy to teach dangerous creatures over more amicable ones.<ref name="HBP9">{{HBP|B|9}}</ref>

===[[1997]]===
{{Quote|Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realised what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small mar-quee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulder-like head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his half-brother and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground.|Grawp attending Dumbledore's funeral|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|The funeral of Albus Dumbledore]]

By the next year, Grawp had become much more docile and lost his violent edge.<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref> He attended the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore]], standing in clothes the size of mar-quees.<ref name="HBP30" /> By this time he had developed a large sense of compassion. During the funeral his head was bent with sorrow, and he patted his half-brother to comfort him. This caused Grawp to unintentionally smash Hagrid into the ground due to his immense strength. 

After the funeral ended, Grawp was seen embracing Hagrid, who was still grieving over Dumbledore's death.<ref name="HBP30" />

===[[1998]]===
{{Quote|At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled, ''HAGGER!'' His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake.|Grawp participates in the second half of the final battle|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

In [[March]] of 1998, he and his brother ran from the [[Death Eaters]] due to the two of them having held a [[Support Harry Potter party]] at Hagrid's hut. This was illegal due to the school being controlled by Death Eaters.<ref name="DH22">{{DH|B|22}}</ref> Afterwards they hid in the [[Cave near Hogsmeade]] for the remainder of the war.

[[File:Hogwarts Big Battle at Hogwarts Moment Pottermore.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Grawp launching himself at Voldemort's giants during the second half of the battle]]

On [[1 May]] of that same year, Hagrid and Grawp heard [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s magically enhanced voice from their cave. Voldemort was delivering an ultimatum of handing [[Harry Potter]] over to him or else a battle would start.<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref> Grawp carried Hagrid and their boarhound [[Fang]], smashing right through the boundaries and then launching Hagrid and Fang together as one through the window of the [[first-floor corridor|first-floor corridor.]] In the first-floor corridor, Harry was wandering. After greeting Harry, Hagrid and Grawp stumbled off to join the fight below.<ref name="DH31" /> As Grawp fought one of Voldemort's giants later on, it finally made the [[trio]] realise he was indeed an undersized giant. They had previously questioned Hagrid's claims of it.<ref name="DH32">{{DH|B|32}}</ref>

Later on, Grawp was seen alive but very angry, attacking Voldemort's giants head-first as he roared in fury.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref> Aided by [[Buckbeak]] and the [[thestral]]s, they were quickly defeated and Grawp moved on to helping others in the fight as reinforcements arrived.<ref name="DH36" />

Grawp eventually survived the battle, and students threw food into his laughing mouth as they celebrated the recent victory in the battle but mourned the loss of the [[Fallen Fifty|dead]].<ref name="DH36" />

===[[21st century]]===
At the start of the [[2009–2010 school year]], Grawp still stayed at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] with [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who made a [[butter-fly pie]] for Grawp.<ref name="MA2">{{MA}}</ref> In the winter of that year, he destroyed a snowman that students were building. The giant footprints left on the scene led some to believe it was done by a [[Yeti]], and they still thought Grawp was one upon meeting him and had a brief fight, but Hagrid cleared the matter up by introducing Grawp as his half-brother.<ref name="MA">{{MA}} - [[December]] [[2021]] special event</ref>

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|Oh yes, tiny! Absolutely minuscule!|A sarcastic comment on Grawp's size|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

At sixteen feet, Grawp was considered short for a giant. He had grey skin, brown-green eyes and hair and appeared like a little mound of land when laid.<ref name="OP30" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|Oh Hagrid, why on earth didn't you let him! What do you think you're going to do with a violent giant who doesn't even want to be here!|Hagrid|Well, now — 'violent' — tha's a bit harsh. I'll admit he mighta taken a couple o' swings at me when he's bin in a bad mood, but he's gettin' better, loads better, settlin' down well....|Discussing Grawp's violent tendencies|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

Grawp was aggressive and violent, both common traits for a true giant and was known to attack [[Rubeus Hagrid|his brother]] when in a foul mood.<ref name="OP30" /> Despite this, Grawp [[love]]d his brother dearly and was badly upset when left alone in June of 1996.<ref name="OP33">{{OOTP|B|33}}</ref>

Grawp initially had great difficulties learning to trust Hagrid, however, as it took nearly a year to gain his trust. The language barrier may have been a factor in this since Hagrid could only speak English and, after nearly a year, Grawp could barely speak comprehensible English.<ref name="HBP30" /> After nearly three years, he could still only just talk properly, and could not pronounce long or difficult words such as "[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]]", which he said as "Hermy", and "[[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]", which he pronounced as "Hagger".<ref name="DH36" />

However, while his language skills were still barely comprehensible, Grawp's personality on the other hand changed immensely under Hagrid's influence, despite doubts that Hagrid's efforts were completely futile.<ref name="OP30" /> By the time he attended the funeral of [[Albus Dumbledore]], Grawp became more kind, gentle, and compassionate. He showed sorrow during the funeral and attempted to comfort Hagrid, who was more devastated by Dumbledore's death, by patting and embracing him (though causing Hagrid's chair to sink into the ground).<ref name="HBP30" /> 

Grawp also showed happiness and joy after [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s final defeat, demonstrating that he had developed an understanding of human emotions.<ref name="DH36" /> However, while most of his violent side was lost, he still retained some of it when he fought against the other giants during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name="DH31" /><ref name="DH32" /><ref name="DH36" />

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:GrawpWU.png|thumb|120px|Grawp as he appears in {{WU}}]]

*The [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|film adaptation]] of {{OOTP}} showed Grawp as less a violent giant and more of a "high spirited", inquisitive child, as his half-brother, Hagrid, said.
*Grawp is portrayed via motion capture<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pa9QKx0dhc "Grawp" | Harry Potter Behind the Scenes] on YouTube</ref> by [[Tony Maudsley]] in {{OOTP|FA}}.<ref>[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2006/4/26/tony-maudsley-to-play-grawp-in-harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix Tony Maudsley to Play Grawp in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]</ref>
*For {{OOTP|FA}}, the in-camera reference for Grawp was performed by William Todd-Jones, who also created Grawp's body performance as used for the sequence's pre-vis.
*The original model for the film was created in 2004 by Gerald Gibbons who based it on a student he had taught back when he was a teacher. The student, Tom Hull, now attends the University of Bath.
*The film adaptation shows Ron Weasley accompanying Harry and Hermione during their first visit to Grawp, as opposed to the book in which Ron was playing in a Quidditch match at that time.
*In the end of the Order of the Phoenix of {{LEGO|Y2}}, Grawp is seen on a high tree trying to help Luna reach a pair of her sneakers.
*It is possible that his name is different from this as Hagrid said that it sounded like Grawp when he says his name. There is a theory that it is how he pronounces "Grow up!"
*Grawp's role in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] from {{DH}} was omitted from the final version of {{DH|F2}}. In addition to this, the character is neither seen nor mentioned in the film.
*[[J. K. Rowling]] mentioned in an interview that when she was writing Grawp's parts into the book that she knew she was giving the filmmakers a challenge when it came time to bring the giant to life on the big screen.<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0720-bluepeter.html "'Harry Potter: A Blue Peter Special.'
