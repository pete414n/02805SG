==Biography==
He was a member of [[Ravenclaw]] house and claimed that he achieved nine "[[Outstanding]]s" in his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L]] exams.

However, [[Hermione Granger]] stopped him, confiscated the [[potion]] and poured its contents down a toilet.<ref name="OOTP31">{{OOTP|B|31}}</ref>
