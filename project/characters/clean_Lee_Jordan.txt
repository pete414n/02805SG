'''Lee Jordan''' (b. [[1977]]/[[1978]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], son of [[Lee Jordan's father|Mr]] and Mrs Jordan, and a [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1989]] to [[1996]] (a couple of years before Harry). During his years at Hogwarts, he became best friends with [[Fred and George Weasley]] and liked doing pranks with them. He often helped them work on their inventions and tricks, some of which were eventually sold at [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]]. Lee also served as a [[Quidditch Commentator]] during his Hogwarts years and was a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]].

After Hogwarts, he hosted a radio show, ''[[Potterwatch]]'', in order to inform and encourage the wizarding world, advising how they could all be protected from [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. In [[1998]], he fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and was devastated by the loss of Fred. He survived the war, though his later life is unknown.


Lee was born in [[1977]] or [[1978]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]]. He was the son of [[Lee Jordan's father|a wizard]].


Early years




Lee Jordan [[First year|started]] his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1989]]. When he arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] during the [[sorting ceremony]], he was Sorted into the house of [[Gryffindor]], where he would share a dormitory with other Gryffindor boys, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], who would become his best friends. Also Sorted in the same house and year as him was [[Angelina Johnson]]. Lee Jordan became the Quidditch commentator, but he was always closely supervised in his job by his head of house, [[Minerva McGonagall]], as his commentary was always biased in favour of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. He was, however, fair to the houses of [[Ravenclaw]] and [[Hufflepuff]] when they were playing, but in the case of [[Slytherin]] he would be highly critical and rude at times.

Third year




In [[1991]], Lee Jordan was going into his [[third year]] of education at Hogwarts, and on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9¾]] he was surrounded by a large group of students, all peering into his box containing a [[Lee Jordan's tarantula|tarantula]] . His friends Fred and George thought nothing of it until it became a giant tarantula with the possible aid of an [[Engorgement Charm|engorging charm]] and they had to rush and see. Lee was a popular troublemaker and so were his best friends. On the evening [[Harry Potter]] was made [[Seeker]] for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team, Fred and George told Harry that they could not stay long as Lee Jordan thought he had discovered a new secret passage out of the school grounds and they wanted to check it out with him.



Later on in the year, when Gryffindor played its first Quidditch match of the season against Slytherin, Lee Jordan commentated. His commentary was heavily biased in favour of Gryffindor. He identified the [[Chaser]]s on each team, and when he spoke of Angelina Johnson, he went on to tell the whole crowd that he was disappointed with her for not wanting to go out with him. Later in the game when the Snitch was first visible, Harry Potter was fouled by Slytherin's [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] and [[Chaser]] [[Marcus Flint]] and Lee was quick to speak the truth and told the audience that it was a deliberate foul. Professor McGonagall had to call Lee into order and he finally stopped his ranting. After the final exams of the year were over, Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] spotted Lee with [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] knee-high off the shore of the lake tickling the [[Giant Squid]].

Fourth year


Lee Jordan's [[fourth year]] was a quieter one; Lee continued to commentate in all the [[Quidditch]] games with a heavy bias towards [[Gryffindor]], and [[Minerva McGonagall]] still assisted in keeping him in line. In [[1992]], Harry's second year, the [[Slytherin]] team had a new seeker, [[Draco Malfoy]], who had bought his way onto the team by having his father, [[Lucius Malfoy]], purchase brooms for the entire team. During the Quidditch match against Slytherin, however, a rogue [[Bludger]] was set on [[Harry Potter]] and the game became surprisingly interesting and extremely dangerous for Harry, other players, and the crowd. At the end of the game, Harry Potter had broken his arm.

Later that year, after [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Penelope Clearwater]] were both [[Petrification|petrified]] on seeing the [[Basilisk]], Lee announced to his fellow [[Gryffindor]]s in the [[Gryffindor Tower|common room]] that no [[Slytherin]] student was petrified so far and claimed that as the [[Salazar Slytherin's basilisk|Basilisk]] was the ''Monster of [[Salazar Slytherin|Slytherin]] '' controlled by the ''[[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]]'', and that it was obvious that the culprit was from Slytherin and hence the school should expel all the Slytherin students.

Fifth year


On the [[Hogwarts Express]] journey into his [[fifth year]], the train was searched by [[Dementor]]s looking for the escapee from [[Azkaban]], [[Sirius Black]]. Jordan again took the role of commentating [[Quidditch]] matches. During the match between [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|Gryffindor]] and [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team|Ravenclaw]], he forgot to commentate on the players, and instead his focus was directed to [[Harry Potter]]'s new [[Firebolt]]. He began to tell the crowd of its amazing features before [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] told him off.



Later that year, during the final match of the season, Gryffindor played [[Slytherin]]. In that match, Lee's commentary was extremely biased in favour of Gryffindor and he even resorted to foul language while criticising the Slytherin team's dirty tactics, which forced Professor McGonagall to try to take away the megaphone from him. Towards the end of the game however, after Slytherin's Seeker [[Draco Malfoy]] stopped Harry from catching the [[Golden Snitch]] by grabbing the end of his Firebolt, McGonagall became just as angry at the Slytherin team and their cheating tactics as Lee was and stopped telling him off for his biased commentary. Despite Slytherin's cheating tactics, Gryffindor won the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]].

Sixth year



During Lee Jordan's [[sixth year]], [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] was the holding grounds to the [[Triwizard Tournament]], which resulted in the cancelling of all Quidditch games. After [[Albus Dumbledore]] had announced that the Triwizard Tournament would be held at Hogwarts, Lee discussed ways to avoid the age restriction that was said to be placed around the [[Goblet of Fire]] with his best friends [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]]. They were only months away from turning seventeen, which was the minimum age requirement for a champion. They attempted to use an [[Ageing Potion]] to get past the age line.

The day before the champion selection, Fred drank a few drops of it with his twin, and later that day jumped across the age line with the whole hall watching. At first, it appeared to have worked, and George followed him with a triumphant yell, but then there was a sizzling sound. Both of the twins were shot ten feet away on the cold stone floor, now accompanied by long white beards. Lee, who had not jumped across the [[Age Line]] with the twins, laughed heartily at them with the rest of the people in the hall, and accompanied Fred and George to the [[Hospital Wing]] to have their beards removed.



[[Harry Potter]], however, was accepted by the Goblet of Fire as a [[Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard]] [[Triwizard Tournament#1994 Triwizard Tournament|champion]] despite his youth and that Hogwarts already had a Triwizard champion in [[Cedric Diggory]] of [[Hufflepuff]]. While Harry and Hermione knew that he did not put his name in the Goblet of Fire, the rest of the Gryffindors, including Lee, believed that Harry found a way to get past the age line and hailed him as a hero as a result. Ron also believed that Harry put his name in the Goblet of Fire, but instead of hailing him as a hero, he became jealous of him, thinking that Harry wanted more fame, which led to the two best friends avoiding each other until the first task has been completed. On the first [[Hogsmeade]] weekend trip, Ron went with Lee, Fred, and George instead of Harry and Hermione. On the journey back home after the tournament ended, the twins reveal to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] had cheated Lee's father over repaying a bet made in the [[Quidditch World Cup]].

Seventh year

On the [[Hogwarts Express]] journey in 1995, Fred and George told Harry that they needed to sit down with Lee Jordan and talk business. By now the plans the three had for a joke shop were well underway and they were in the process of lining up suppliers and creating initial ideas. Lee also saw wanted criminal [[Sirius Black]] in his [[animagus]] form at Platform 9¾, but thought it was Harry's dog. He also complemented Harry on his "dog", saying that it was cool.



When he arrived at Hogwarts, Lee Jordan soon learnt that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was interfering in the functioning of Hogwarts and that [[Dolores Umbridge]], [[Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic]], had been appointed [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor]] of Hogwarts as a result. This meant trouble for Lee and his friends as they normally enjoyed pulling pranks at the expense of people such as [[Argus Filch]].  However, they couldn't do so this year with her watching. When it was time for action to be put into place, [[Hermione Granger]] came up with idea of an organisation against Umbridge, [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Lee willingly became a member of the organisation along with Fred and George. When he, George, and Fred arrived for the first meeting of the organisation at the [[Hog's Head]] they were all seen carrying large bags of merchandise from [[Zonko's Joke Shop]].

]]

Later on in the year, [[Minerva McGonagall]] told off Lee for his commentary again when he became extremely complimentary towards Gryffindor captain [[Angelina Johnson]] in the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin, and yet again complained about her not going out with him. He was also one of the students who were enthusiastic over [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|Hogwarts gamekeeper]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher [[Rubeus Hagrid]] returning to the school after his [[Mission to the Giant colony|Order mission]], and rushed to the staff table along with Fred and George to shake his hand.

Shortly after the mass outbreak from [[Azkaban]], teachers were forbidden from discussing anything unrelated to academics with their students as per the ''Educational Decree Number 27 ''passed by the Ministry of Magic. Lee took this new rule as an opportunity to deny Umbridge and correctly reminded her that she had no business in arguing with Fred and George over playing [[Exploding Snap]] in the back of her class as it was a non-academic subject. However, she did not see it that way and he was made to serve detention using a [[Black Quill|Blood Quill]] to write lines. After having served detention [[Harry Potter]] suggested using [[Murtlap Essence|Essence of Murtlap]] to heal the wounds on his hand.

He felt dispirited when Fred and George [[Fred and George Weasley's departure from Hogwarts|escaped from Hogwarts]]. This had an adverse effect on his Quidditch commentary, as witnessed in the final match of the season between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, where he commentated without any enthusiasm. However he did swear very badly when Ravenclaw captain [[Roger Davies]] scored the first goal of the match. He took over the twins' rebellion against Umbridge, and harassed her by levitating [[Niffler]]s in through her window. This turned out to cause more harm than help — Umbridge thought that Hagrid was doing it, and added to her reasoning to sack him.






On [[1 August]], [[1997]], Lee attended the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], Fred and George's older brother, to [[Fleur Delacour]]. While there, he danced with the twins' younger sister, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], among others. It is unknown if he Apparated before the Death Eaters stormed the wedding, after [[Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley]]'s Patronus warning or if he was still present when they interrogated everyone still remaining at [[The Burrow]] on the location of [[Harry Potter]].

Potterwatch
During the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Lee hosted a radio show called ''[[Potterwatch]]'', under the codename "River". ''Potterwatch'' acted as a voice of truth while the [[Wizarding Wireless Network]] and ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' fell under the influence of the [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]-controlled [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Lee and his co-hosts [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Remus Lupin]] and Fred Weasley voiced support for [[Harry Potter]] and encouraged wizards and witches to protect the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s who were being victimised by [[Death Eaters]].

[[Battle of Hogwarts]]


Lee Jordan also returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in 1998 when he was contacted by [[Neville Longbottom]] via his Dumbledore's Army coin along with Fred, George, Ginny, and [[Cho Chang]] to participate in the final battle. Lee Jordan proved useful during the Battle of Hogwarts as he had a great knowledge of all the Hogwarts secret passages and together, he, Fred, George, and [[Hannah Abbott]] guarded the fallen passages. Also in the battle he and George slammed Death Eater [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]] to the floor near the end of the conflict. He also witnessed [[Harry Potter]]'s final defeat of Lord Voldemort.


As Lee was not listed among the causalities, and he was seen alive during the end of the battle, it is assumed that he witnessed the final duel between [[Harry Potter]] and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and that he survived the war.

It is possible that he might have gone to work at [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] to continue assisting George Weasley with the creation and selling of their joke products; it is, however, unknown if it ever happened for sure.


By at least the [[2010s]], Lee Jordan was captured by the [[Calamity]] and began to appear around the world as a [[Foundable]].


Lee was described as a black boy with black hair and dreadlocks. In [[1996]], his hand was scarred by [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s [[Black Quill|blood quill]] as a punishment.




Lee was a humorous and comedic individual who loved doing pranks, much like his best friends [[Fred and George Weasley]]. He also had a good-hearted personality and was very friendly and popular among his friends. He was a very biased Quidditch commentator, especially against any team not from Gryffindor. He liked to joke in front of [[Minerva McGonagall]], who was always very serious and strict. Lee was very brave, and he defended his friends and did not hesitate to express his opinions to [[Dolores Umbridge]], nor did he hesitate to slip [[Niffler]]s into her office (despite the fact he became worried when he learned that Umbridge was coming close to firing [[Rubeus Hagrid]] because she believed he was putting the Nifflers into her office.)


Furthermore, he derided Umbridge in front of the whole class, as he thought she deserved it, and became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in order to learn [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] from [[Harry Potter|Harry]]. After Hogwarts, he hosted a radio show called ''[[Potterwatch]]'' in order to encourage the listeners, telling them that Harry Potter was still alive and he could defeat Voldemort. He agreed with [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]'s point of view on the equal treatment of all people, magic and [[Non-magic people|muggle]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Lee's courage was also displayed when he fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in order to defeat the [[Death Eaters]].


*'''[[Charm]]s''': Lee earned an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in the [[Charms (class)|subject]]. He was able to cast the [[Levitation Charm]], which he used to levitate [[Niffler]]s into [[Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge's]] office during the [[1995-1996 school year]].
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Lee was a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], so he must have mastered many offensive and defensive spells, under [[Harry Potter]]'s masterful teaching. He also earned a high graded [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in the subject, and was able to study it at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Lee was a very skilled duellist, as his name was not mentioned amongst the casualties, implying he survived the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. During the battle he and [[George Weasley|George]] also managed to slam Death Eater [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]] to the floor, showing his impressive talents in [[martial magic]].
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Lee was able to [[Vanishing Spell|vanish]] objects in his seventh year, which is some of the most complicated [[magic]] taught in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration class]], showing him to have been proficient in this field.



Little is known about Lee's relationship with his parents. However, Lee told Fred and George that [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] had once stolen money from Lee's [[Lee Jordan's father|father]], who became very angry. During the [[Second Wizarding War]], Lee's parents most likely opposed the [[Death Eaters]], like their son.




Lee Jordan was best friends with both the Weasley twins during his time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Lee Jordan was rarely seen outside of the company of either Fred or George. Lee got into a lot of trouble with the twins over his time at Hogwarts, in [[1991]] Lee brought a giant tarantula onto the [[Hogwarts Express]], and in [[1995]] he joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and helped the twins harass [[Dolores Umbridge]], which resulted in him "writing lines", scarring his hand. He was rather lonely after Fred and George's departure, but continued to wreak havoc by lifting Nifflers into her office. In [[1998]], after Fred and George had left school, Lee returned with them to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, in which Lee lost one of his best friends, Fred.





Lee Jordan seemed to have a crush on [[Angelina Johnson]], on several occasions commenting during [[Quidditch]] on her physical appearance, and once even stating that she refused to go out with him, much to the annoyance of [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] who was embarrassed by his commentary during Quidditch games. Despite the fact that Angelina and [[Fred Weasley]], Lee's best friend, were in a relationship, Lee still jokingly spoke of his love for Angelina. Angelina eventually married [[George Weasley]], Lee's best friend and Fred's twin brother.


, his Head of House and Transfiguration professor]]
Lee, much like Fred and George, was considered as a troublemaker by his professors at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. [[Minerva McGonagall]] was the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] professor, the head of [[Gryffindor]] house, and a very serious and strict person. However, Lee sometimes joked in front of her, and she often shouted at him. Although McGonagall disapproved of his behaviour, both of them opposed and ridiculed [[Dolores Umbridge]] in [[1995]]. Furthermore, Lee and McGonagall both fought along at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].

Lee also disliked [[Severus Snape]], the [[Potions Master]] and the head of [[Slytherin]] house. Snape favoured the Slytherin students and was very strict with the students he did not like, including Lee.

However, Lee likely liked professors [[Filius Flitwick]], [[Pomona Sprout]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. Hagrid was also a good friend of Fred and George.

One of the teachers Lee hated most was [[Dolores Umbridge]], the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor in [[1995]]. She was an extremely sadistic woman and she liked punishing the students. When Lee joked in front of her, and thus ridiculed her, she made him “write lines”, with a special Blood Quill, that scarred Lee's hand. Lee strongly opposed Umbridge, becoming a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], and supporting [[Fred and George Weasley]] during their departure from Hogwarts.





 and [[Remus Lupin]]]]

Lee allied with the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. He already knew some members, such as Fred, George, Harry, Ron and Hermione. In [[1997]], Lee and the other members of the order hosted ''[[Potterwatch]]'', a radio show, in order to give information about [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and [[Severus Snape]] to the listeners, encourage them and advise them to think that both wizards and muggles should be protected from the Death Eaters.

Lee appeared to be friendly with [[Remus Lupin]], whom he called “Romulus” during the show. They discussed together about many things that concerned the wizarding world. They also agreed that [[Harry Potter]] was alive, and that he made a plan in order to destroy Voldemort. Lee and Lupin fought together at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where Lupin was killed. Lee was possibly saddened when he learned about his death.

Lee also appeared to have the same point of view with [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], who believed that every human life is worth the same, and worth saving. Lee responded by expressing his opinion that Kingsley was right, and that he would vote him as a [[Minister for Magic]]. After the war, Kingsley eventually became Minister for Magic.




Lee became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in [[1995]], in order to learn [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] from [[Harry Potter]] and oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Lee was friendly with the most members of the Army. Some of his closest friends appeared to be [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Katie Bell]], [[Oliver Wood]] (who wasn't an official member of the army, but supported them and fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] alongside them), [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. All of them seemed to like Lee and have fun with him. Other friends of Lee may have been fellow Gryffindors [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], [[Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown,]] and [[Parvati Patil]], as well as Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, such as [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Marietta Edgecombe]], and [[Zacharias Smith]]. As Lee was rather friendly with most people, he had a good relationship with them, except for Smith, whom with he, Fred and George argued about Voldemort's return.


The Jordan is a river in Southwest Asia flowing to the Dead Sea; the river serves as the eastern border of Israel. Similarly, there are several rivers throughout the world named "Lee," including rivers in England, Ireland, and Canada. Thus, when on ''Potterwatch'' Lee's code name is "River," the name is very appropriate. Lee can also refer to the "lee side" of a ship, which would be the side protected from the wind (or downwind). Lee can also mean a field or meadow. Jordan can also mean to "flow" or "descend." Jordan is also old English for a chamber pot (a small container in the bedroom, used for going to the bathroom, before indoor plumbing).




*In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], Lee Jordan is played by [[Luke Youngblood]], who also provided the voice for Lee in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of .
*In the film adaption of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix there was an unnamed black Gryffindor boy who resembles Lee Jordan. However he doesn't have Dreadlocks and he may be Dean Thomas's Stunt double.
*In , only one (unnamed) person, probably Lee Jordan, is heard hosting ''[[Potterwatch]]''.
*In , [[Nigel Wolpert]] contacts the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He addresses the person he is speaking to as "River".
*In the Harry Potter games, Lee Jordan always starts his commentary by reminding the player of the basics of [[Quidditch]], and what needs to be done to win the challenge.
*In , Lee Jordan does not sport dreadlocks.
