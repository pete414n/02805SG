'''Bozo''' was a photographer for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. He appeared to be associated with [[Rita Skeeter]].

==Biography==
===1992===
{{Quote|Out of the way, there. This is for the ''Daily Prophet''.|Bozo treats Ron Weasley inconsiderately in pursuit of the perfect shot|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Photographer.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Bozo in 1992]]
Bozo covered [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s book-signing at [[Flourish and Blotts]] in [[1992]], and was so single-mindedly  focused on getting a good shot at one point that he backed into [[Ronald Weasley]], stepping on his foot as he snapped at him to get out of the way. When Lockhart saw that [[Harry Potter]] was in the crowd, he pulled Harry to the front and shook his hand, deliberately giving the photographer an opportunity to take pictures he felt would be "worth the front page".

===Triwizard Tournament===
Bozo was present at the [[wand weighing ceremony]] preceding the 1994 [[Triwizard Tournament]], accompanying Rita Skeeter to do a piece on the tournament for the ''Prophet''. He appeared to be entranced by [[Fleur Delacour]], as he attempted to bring her into greater prominence of the group shots he was taking, and was watching her out of the corner of his eye during the ceremony.

Later that school year, Bozo accompanied Rita on a visit to the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]]. While there, Rita conferred with Bozo on the possibility of spinning a story out of [[Ludovic Bagman]] being pursued by a group of [[goblin]]s.

==Physical appearance==
Bozo was described as "paunchy".

==Etymology==
*A bozo is a foolish or incompetent person.
*The Tagalog word ''boso'' which means "to maliciously watch/peek at somebody through a hole or slit".
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_the_Clown Bozo] is also the name of an iconic American clown, and is at times considered a generic term for a clown.

==Behind the scenes==
*Bozo was portrayed by [[Peter O'Farrell]] in {{COS|FA}} and [[Robert Wilfort]] in {{GOF|FA}}.
*The photographer from {{COS}} is not identified as the same wizard as Bozo in the books. {{PM}}, however, confirms them to be the same character by giving them a singular entry that describes them being the same person.
*In the second novel as well as the GBA version of the video game, Bozo was shown to have a rude personality, but in the film adaptation, he appears to have good manners.
