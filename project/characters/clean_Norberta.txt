'''Norberta''' (born '''Norbert'''; Spring of [[1992]]) was a female [[Norwegian Ridgeback]] [[Dragon]] hatched by [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in his [[Hagrid's Hut|hut]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].



 in the fire]]
During the [[1991–1992 school year]], [[Professor]] [[Quirinus Quirrell]], trying to figure out how to get past [[Fluffy]] and retrieve the [[Philosopher's Stone]], disguised himself and enticed [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to play a game of cards by wagering Norberta's [[Dragon egg|egg]]. They had a few drinks, and Quirrell asked him if he was sure he could handle raising a dragon. Hagrid told him about how he managed Fluffy, inadvertently giving Quirrell the information he needed. Hagrid later assumed that 'the stranger' was a [[Dragon dealer]].




Rubeus Hagrid kept the egg in his [[Hagrid's Hut|hut]], warming it over a [[fire]] until it hatched. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Harry Potter|Harry]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] were present when Norberta hatched. Also present (though at first unknown) was [[Draco Malfoy]], who peered through a window of Hagrid's hut. The trio feared that Hagrid would get in trouble, and so convinced him to get rid of the dragon. The baby dragon looked "like a crumpled black umbrella" with large spiny wings, a skinny body and a long snout with wide nostrils, horn stubs and bulging, orange eyes and tried to bite Hagrid, although he found her to be adorable and instantly wanted to keep her. He named the newborn dragon "Norbert", believing her to be a boy, and fed her with a bucket of [[Mixture of brandy and chicken blood|brandy mixed with chicken blood]] every half hour, as recommended in ''[[Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit]]''.

However, as the young dragon grew, she became too violent and dangerous to keep. After Norberta bit [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s hand, for which he had to go to the [[Hospital Wing]] due to the [[Norwegian Ridgeback venom|venom]] in her fangs, Hagrid had no choice but to release Norberta to [[Charles Weasley]], who worked with dragons in [[Romania]].

When Hagrid met Charlie at [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]], he was informed that the dragon, originally thought to be a male and had been given the male name Norbert, was now called Norberta, as Charlie had discovered that she was in fact a female. He said that he was able to tell by the females being much more violent and ferocious.


''Norbert'' is a Germanic first name, derived from ''nord'' ("north") and ''berht'' ("bright"). ''Norberta'' is simply a feminine form of this name.






*Norberta has a different departure in . Instead of her presence remaining a secret and Harry and Hermione handing her over to Charlie's friends, the Hogwarts staff becomes aware of her, and Dumbledore had her sent off to Romania. Also, the dragon is shown to be affectionate with the groundskeeper, rather than violent. Because of this difference in behaviour, it is possible that Norbert is in fact a male in the film version of the story.
*Since Hagrid's conversation with Charlie was not featured in , Norberta's identity as a female dragon was never acknowledged in the films.
*"Baby Norbert" was one out of the thirty-two options generated by an old feature on , "Wonderful wizarding world happiness generator", which was about things that could cast away the Blue Monday blues.
**The description was "A baby dragon may not be everyone’s idea of ‘cheerful’, but when Norbert (or Norberta, actually) was just a wee baby, we could kind of see why Hagrid went all gooey over him/her".
*In , one can purchase a plush version of Norberta.
*While Norberta is black-coloured, the  mini-figure is green.
*Norberta also appears to be greenish in .
*In , the parts with Noberta, before and after being hatched, appear only in a Time-Turner mission, but Hagrid does not explain where he got the egg.
