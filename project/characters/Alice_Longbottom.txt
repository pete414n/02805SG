'''Alice Longbottom''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], an [[Auror]] who worked for the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] during [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[First Wizarding War|first rise to power]]. Alice and her husband [[Frank Longbottom]], were also members of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]] and fought against Voldemort and his [[Death Eaters]] during the [[First Wizarding War]].

At the end of the war in [[1981]], when their son [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] was only an infant, Alice and Frank were [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] into insanity by a group of Death Eaters. She and her husband were subsequently placed in the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] for irrevocable spell damage at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], where they were residing until at least [[January]] [[1996]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Little is known about Alice's early life. She may have attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. During her education, she must have achieved at least five [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]], of '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' or higher. At some point, Alice married [[Frank Longbottom]].

===First Wizarding War {{c|1970s-1981}}===
{{Quote|The one with the power to vanquish the [[Tom Riddle|Dark Lord]] approaches...Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies...and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives...The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.|[[Sybill Trelawney]]'s first prophecy|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250px|thumb|left|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]

After graduating, Alice became a well-respected [[Auror]], as did her husband. At the time, [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]] were growing increasingly powerful. In response to this Alice and Frank joined the original [[Order of the Phoenix]] to oppose them. The Order was a secret society established by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in order to contain the present threat. It can be assumed that Alice and her husband played a vital role in the Order. 

In time, Frank and Alice earned the wrath of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].

Alice gave birth to their only child, [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]], on [[30 July]] [[1980]]. Moments after his birth, Neville was able to [[underage magic|magically adjust]] his blankets so that he was swaddled more snugly, but no one witnessed this remarkable feat. The [[Alice Longbottom's midwife|midwife]] who attended the birth assumed that Frank had tucked the newborn boy in more tightly.

As Aurors and Order members, Alice and Frank defied Lord Voldemort himself three times. This made their son one of the two young infants who was the possible subject of a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] made by [[Sybill Trelawney]] about the person who could defeat the Dark Lord. The other infant was [[Harry Potter]], son of Order members [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]]. Trelawney's prediction was overheard by Death Eater [[Severus Snape]], who informed Voldemort. The Dark Lord targeted Harry, perhaps because he was also a [[half-blood]], and was defeated for the first time on 31 October, [[1981]].

Shortly afterward, Alice and Frank were attacked by Death Eaters: [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]] and [[Rabastan Lestrange]], and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Bartemius Crouch Jnr]]. They were captured and tortured extensively with the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. The Death Eaters were caught and sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]] for their crimes, but their victims would never recover.

Alice was deemed insane, loosing her capability to function in society. She and Frank were placed in the permanent ward of [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]].

Because of Alice's inability to care for her son, Neville was raised in the care of his fraternal grandmother, [[Augusta Longbottom]]. Neville regularly visited his parents for Christmas and other holidays. His parents did not overtly recognise Neville on these visits. Alice customarily gave her son chewing gum wrappers, which he kept. 

Neville was taunted about his parents' state by one of their attackers, Bellatrix Lestrange. She taunted him during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].

==Physical appearance==
Alice was a round-faced woman with short hair, and her son [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] resembled her quite strongly. By the mid-[[1990s]], however, her face became thin and worn, and her hair had become white, wispy and dead-looking, which was most likely due to her insanity from the Cruciatus Curse along with older age.

==Personality and traits==
Alice was a well-respected Auror and member of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]]. She and her husband were much beloved among the wizarding community. After they were tortured into insanity, Alice was not able to specifically recognise her son, although she related to Neville as someone she was fond of.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': In addition to being a highly talented [[Auror]], implying that she achieved the necessary grades in her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] and [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]], Alice was a valued member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and a highly competent witch. She successfully defied [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] on three separate occasions and survived the actual [[First Wizarding War|war]] unscathed, only afterwards was she subjected to horrendous torture by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and her cohorts.
*'''[[Auror]] skills''': Alice was a highly respected [[Auror]], and as such, a very accomplished and skilful witch. Along with her [[Frank Longbottom|husband]] and [[Alastor Moody]], she successfully rounded up many of the Dark Lord's followers throughout the latter's first rise to power. Despite her considerable ability, however, she was unable to fight off a group of some of the fiercest supporters of Lord Voldemort that targeted her and her husband shortly after Lord Voldemort's disappearance looking for information about the whereabouts of their fallen leader, who managed to capture them and subsequently tortured the couple to insanity by the [[Death Eaters]], namely [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]] and [[Rabastan Lestrange]], along with [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]].

==Relationships==
===Longbottom family===
{{Quote|Well, we'd better get back. Very nice to have met you all. Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your [[Neville Longbottom's bedroom|bedroom]] by now.|Neville's grandmother instructing Neville to throw away the wrapper his mother had given him|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Frank et Alice Londubat.png|250x250px|thumb|Alice with her husband and infant son|alt=]]

Alice and her husband were Aurors and members of the first [[Order of the Phoenix]]. They had a son named [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] together. When Neville was only a year old, Alice and Frank were tortured to insanity by four [[Death Eaters]]. The Death Eaters were imprisoned for life in [[Azkaban]], but Frank and Alice required permanent care at St Mungo's.

Neville was very sad about his parents, and visited them in the hospital; although they could not recognise him, he was also "quite proud" to be their son as he told Harry Potter in 1995. [[Augusta Longbottom]], Alice's mother-in-law, was also very sad. She too had a high opinion of them and was very proud when her grandson fought in several battles; like his parents, she even stated that he was finally starting to "''live up to his father at last.''"

===Order of the Phoenix===
Other members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] appeared to have had a good relationship with Frank and Alice during the [[First Wizarding War]]. Some of them, such as [[Alastor Moody]], were very sad that the Longbottoms were tortured into insanity. Moody also stated that the Longbottoms would rather die, instead of what had happened to them. Most members of the order had been slaughtered by the end of the First Wizarding War, and only a few survived.

==Etymology==
The name ''[[Wikipedia:Alice (given name)|Alice]]'' is derived from the French name ''Adelais'', which is in turn derived from the Germanic name ''Adalheidis'', from the Germanic word elements ''adal'', meaning "noble", and ''heid'', meaning "type".

==Behind the scenes==
*[[J. K. Rowling]] stated in interview the significance of the candy wrappers: ''"That idea was one of the very few that was inspired by a real event. I was told what, to me, was a very sad story by someone I know about their elderly mother who had Alzheimer's, and the elderly mother was in a closed ward. She was very severely demented and no longer recognised her son, but he went faithfully to visit her twice a week, and he used to take her sweets. That was their point of connection; she had a sweet tooth, she recognised him as the sweet-giver. That was very poignant to me. So I embroidered the story. Neville gives his mother what she wants, and (it makes me sad to think of it) she wants to give something back to him, but what she gives back to him is essentially worthless. But he still takes it as worth something because she's trying to give, so it does mean something, in emotional terms."''
