'''Ambrosius Flume''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who, by the [[1990s]], ran [[Honeydukes|Honeydukes Sweetshop]] in [[Hogsmeade]], a very popular shop among Hogwarts students during the [[Hogsmeade weekend trips|school's weekend trips]] to the village, with [[Ambrosius Flume's wife|his wife]].



Ambrosius Flume attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]] in his youth and was taught [[Potions (class)|Potions]] by [[Horace Slughorn]]. Ambrosius became a member of the [[Slug Club]].


As he was a member of the [[Slug Club]], [[Horace Slughorn]] introduced Ambrosius to [[Ciceron Harkiss]] and thus had him employed. As repayment for Horace's kindness, Flume sent a hamper of Slughorn's favourite sweets ([[Crystallised Pineapple|Crystallised pineapple]]) to him annually on his birthday.


At some point in his life, Ambrosius married [[Ambrosius Flume's wife|Mrs Flume]].


It is most likely that as a former Hogwarts student Ambrosius participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] alongside his [[Ambrosius Flume's wife|wife]], and fellow [[Hogsmeade]] residents [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] and [[Puddifoot|Madam Puddifoot]].


''Ambrosius'' comes from the Greek word "ambrosia" meaning food or drink of the deities. It is also referred as nectar, which is sweet and bestows immortality. A flume is an artificial channel for the flow of [[water]].


*Flume may have been the one who told [[Tom Riddle]] that [[Horace Slughorn]] was quite fond of [[Crystallised Pineapple]]. Tom used this sweet as a casual bribe the night he asked Slughorn on the method and effects of creating [[Horcrux]]es.
*It is possible, as he was a former [[Slug Club]] member, that he attended the [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] in [[1996]].
*In , Ambrosius only appears in a flashback on disc 2 from  and is mentioned on the original script.
**Also in the novel, Slughorn said that Ambrosius sent a hamper of his favourite sweets, which were [[Crystallised Pineapple]], every birthday, while on the original script from the film Slughorn said that Ambrosius sent him a hamper of chocolate each birthday. This is possibly why it was cut from the film, as it contradicts the novel and would totally ruin later events, such as Slughorn's memory about the [[Slug Club]] dinner with [[Tom Riddle]], in which Tom gave Slughorn crystallised pineapple.
