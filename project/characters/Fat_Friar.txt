{{Quote|Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give [[Peeves]] a second chance —|The Fat Friar's characteristic forgiveness|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
The '''Fat Friar''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]], who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]]. He was a jolly man and very forgiving. He devoted his life to religion and, after his death, returned to the school as the resident ghost of [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]].

==Biography==
===Life===
{{Quote|Hope to see you in Hufflepuff! My old house, you know.|The Fat Friar to the first-years before the [[Sorting Ceremony]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
The Friar was born no earlier than [[First millennium A.D.|982]],<ref name="birthdate"/> somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]].<ref name="PS7"/>

At the age of eleven, the Friar became a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[Scotland]]. He was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]] and was taught by [[Helga Hufflepuff]] in the magical arts the seven years that followed.<ref name="house"/>

At some point in his life, he joined the clergy as part of a mendicant religious order, meaning that he spent his life begging in the name of charity. A noble life for a noble man. Apparently, given his physically large appearance, he indulged in the pleasures of food<ref name="PS7"/> and drink.<ref name="PSf13"/>

The Fat Friar's kindness was to be his undoing. He was executed because senior churchmen grew suspicious of his ability to cure the [[pox]] merely by poking peasants with a stick, and his ill-advised habit of pulling [[rabbit]]s out of the [[communion]] cup.<ref name="POT">{{WW|hogwarts-ghosts}}</ref>

===Post-mortem===
[[File:Friar Feast.png|250px|thumb|left|The Fat Friar after his death]]
The Friar returned from the dead as a [[ghost]], and returned to [[Hogwarts Castle]], where he became the house ghost of his former House, [[Hufflepuff]].<ref name="PS7"/> He has thus far spent the majority of his afterlife within the castle walls along with the other Hogwarts ghosts.

After his death, the Fat Friar retained his kind and joyful demeanour. He eagerly welcomed new students to the school and offered assistance whenever needed.

====[[1985–1986 school year]]====
The Fat Friar participated in planning [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's four-hundred and ninety-third Deathday Party|Sir Nicholas's 493rd deathday party]] when [[Erling the Great|Erling]], a friend of his, visited Hogwarts. When he knew that Sir Nicholas and Erling had the same deathday, he suggested eagerly for the two to hold a party together, but it was rejected by Erling. Nevertheless, the Friar guided Erling through a tour in Hogwarts, including the [[Charms Classroom]] and the [[dungeons]].<ref name="HMDDP2">{{HM|2|DUELLING DEATHDAY PARTIES|2}}</ref>

During their parties, when he saw neither of them was going on well, he gathered them together and asked again for a collective party, which they agreed. He attended the party and a dance.<ref name="HM2DDP4">{{HM|2|DUELLING DEATHDAY PARTIES|4}}</ref>

====[[1988–1989 school year]]====
During this school year, [[Penny Haywood]] and [[Jacob's sibling]] consulted with the Fat Friar in the [[Great Hall]] to inquire if he knew anything about [[Duncan Ashe]] or the [[Marauder's Map]]. He recommended they seek Sir Nicholas for help finding the map, as he himself was unaware.<ref name="HM56">{{HM|5|6}}</ref>

Later during this school year, Jacob's sibling and [[Merula Snyde]] spoke to him in the [[Hufflepuff Common Room]] to ask if he had seen [[Peeves]]. He offered to help but sadly could not give much help as to find Peeves, with him commenting he would know more about curing peasants of the pox.<ref name="HM521">{{HM|5|21}}</ref>

====[[1991–1992 school year]]====
{{Dialogue a-b|Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?|Fat Friar|New students! About to be Sorted, I suppose?|The Fat Friar and Sir Nicholas discussing Peeves|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Shortly before the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] on [[1 September]] [[1991]], the ghosts came across the first years waiting for [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], while discussing whether [[Peeves]] should be allowed to attend the Feast (for he had given the house elves quite a bit of trouble, throwing food and breaking dishes). The Friar was excited to see the new students, and smiled around at them. He later attended the Feast, and waved merrily at students being [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]], notably [[Hannah Abbott]].<ref name="PS7"/>

On [[2 September]], the Friar haunted the [[Charms corridor|Charms Corridor]], chanting aloud as he hovered around.<ref name="PSps1">{{PS|G}} - PS1 version</ref>

====[[1992–1993 school year]]====
{{Quote|They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead.|Description of Nicholas' five-hundredth Deathday Party|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Deathday Party Pottermore.png|250px|thumb|left|Fat Friar at [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]]'s five-hundredth Deathday Party]]
In the evening of [[31 October]] [[1992]], the Friar attended Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|five-hundredth Deathday Party]], where he engaged in conversation with a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead.<ref name="CS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref>

This year, the Friar could be usually seen strolling around the [[Grand Staircase]].<ref name="CSpc">{{COS|G}} - PC version</ref>

====[[1994–1995 school year]]====
{{Quote|Peeves, of course. The usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the feast — well, it's quite out of the question, you know what he's like, utterly uncivilised, can't see a plate of food without throwing it. We held a ghost's council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his foot down.|Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington telling the trio of the ghost council and about [[Peeves]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Ghosts of Hogwarts.jpg|250px|thumb|The House ghosts of Hogwarts]]
In the afternoon of [[1 September]] [[1994]], the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] ghosts gathered to decide whether Peeves should be allowed to attend the Start-of-Term Feast. The Fat Friar wanted to give him another chance, but both [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] and the [[Bloody Baron]] decided against it, as it was Peeves and he could not and did not want to change, and therefore did not deserve a second chance. As a result, Peeves wreaked havoc in the kitchens, spilling soup all over the place and scattering pots and pans everywhere, scaring the house-elves that were present.<ref name="GF12">{{GOF|B|12}}</ref>

====[[1995–1996 school year]]====
{{Quote|Dumbledore will be back before long. They couldn't keep him away in our second year and they won't be able to this time. The Fat Friar told me — that Umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they'd searched the castle and grounds for him. Couldn't get past the gargoyle. The Head's office has sealed itself against her. Apparently, she had a right little tantrum.|[[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] telling the trio what the Friar told him about Dolores Umbridge|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Fat Friar First Floor Corridor.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Friar around the [[First-floor corridor]]]]
By [[1995]], there was a [[Portrait|tetraptych]] of the Friar hung in the first-floor corridor.<ref name="OPg">{{OOTP|G}}</ref> He would frequently haunt this area during this school year. It is unknown what he did with the rest of his time.

After the [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Eight]] was passed on [[21 April]] [[1996]], the Fat Friar saw [[Dolores Umbridge]] fruitlessly trying to get access to the [[Headmaster's Tower]], as the tower had sealed itself against her and later told Ernie Macmillan about it.<ref name="OP28">{{OOTP|B|28}}</ref> It is safe to assume that like all other residents of Hogwarts that the Friar did not like Umbridges's presence in the school.

====[[1996–1997 school year]]====
{{Quote|An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and young... The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air.|Description of Albus Dumbledore's [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|The ghosts of Hogwarts at Albus Dumbledore's funeral]]
The Fat Friar was present in the castle on [[30 June]] [[1997]] when [[Death Eaters]] invaded the school. It is unknown if he assisted in the ensuing battle or not. [[Albus Dumbledore]], [[Headmaster]] of Hogwarts, was killed at the hands of [[Severus Snape]] in the former's plan on top of the Astronomy Tower.<ref name="HBP27">{{HBP|B|27}}</ref> The Hogwarts ghosts were some of the known attendees of his funeral in early July, which most likely included the Friar.<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>

====[[1997–1998 school year]]====
{{Quote|The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with dishevelled students… Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts.|The students and ghosts moments prior to the battle|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
On [[1 August]] [[1997]], the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was taken over by Lord Voldemort's [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref> By [[1 September]] 1997, [[Severus Snape]] was made [[Headmaster]] of Hogwarts while his fellow [[Death Eaters]], Alecto Carrow and Amycus Carrow became the [[Muggle Studies]] and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teachers respectively.<ref name="DH12">{{DH|B|12}}</ref>

The [[Carrow family|Carrows]] were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, which were violent.  Many people had bruises, cuts, or scars  from the evil siblings. It is likely the Friar, as did the [[Head of House|Heads of House]], tried to protect the pupils from Alecto and Amycus.<ref name="DH29">{{DH|B|29}}</ref>

[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the Second Wizarding War]]
On [[2 May]] [[1998]], the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] ensued after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] learned [[Harry Potter]] was in the premises. The ghosts, likely including the Friar, attended a gathering in the [[Great Hall]], in which Professor McGonagall gave instructions on evacuation of underage students and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] organised the participants for battle.<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref> Later on, the ghosts gathered at the Great Hall, joining the mass mourning over the dead.<ref name="DH33">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>

When the [[Second Wizarding War]] came to an end, it is possible that the ghosts (including the Friar) celebrated Harry's victory and Voldemort's demise.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>

==Physical description==
{{Quote|<nowiki/>''[…]'' looked like a fat little monk ''[…]''|Description|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:PM Hogwarts ghost Fat Friar.gif|200px|thumb|Fat Friar laughing]]
As a ghost, the Friar was pearly-white and slightly transparent, like all other ghosts.<ref name="PS7"/> He had short brown hair, which he wore with a small tonsure.<ref name="PSf13"/> At first sight a monk,<ref name="PS7"/> he was dressed in a habit held by a rope belt.<ref name="PSf13"/> He was fat and short,<ref name="PS7"/> and usually carried a mug with him.<ref name="PSf13"/>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.|Description of the Friar's cheerful deposition |Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
The Friar was very cheerful and welcoming, and happily greeted new students at Hogwarts.<ref name="PS7"/> He also tended to find something to value in anyone and look past their faults, as he always insisted with the other ghosts to let [[Peeves]] attend the [[Start-of-Term Feast]]s despite his many wrongdoings.<ref name="PS7"/><ref name="GF12"/> He also appeared to be quite sociable, meeting and engaging in conversation with fellow ghosts during [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]]'s [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|five-hundredth Deathday Party]].<ref name="CS8"/> He also seems to have some House pride, as he happily reminisced about his "old House" when welcoming [[first year|first-years]].<ref name="PS7"/> Despite this, he was always resentful of the fact that he was never made a [[cardinal]].<ref name="POT" /> His overly kindness has proven to be his undoing, as he would heal the pox simply by poking with a stick, and pull rabbits out of the communion cup, showing recklessness in terms of concealing his wizardry.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': The Fat Friar was a talented [[Healer]], as he could cure sick individuals [[magic]]ally with the touch of his [[wand]]. This meant he was remarkably proficient with the casting of [[Healing spell]]s.<ref name="POT"/>
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': The Fat Friar was proficient with this very advanced branch of magic, as he was able to conjure [[rabbit]]s from within the communion cup.<ref name="POT" /> [[Conjuration]] is a particularly difficult form of transfiguration, which is proof of his skill in this field.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:LEGO Fat Friar.jpg|120px|thumb|The Fat Friar as depicted in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
*The Friar was portrayed by [[Simon Fisher-Becker]] in {{PS|FA}}, the only film he has appeared in.
*The Friar is the only House ghost whose death was not discussed in the books. The circumstances of his death were finally revealed via {{PM}}.
*The Fat Friar's name is probably a pun on the term "Fat Fryer"; equipment used to deep fry food, such as chips. It is associated with food, as is the Fat Friar and [[Hufflepuff]] in general.
*Alternatively, the Fat Friar's name could be alliterative and a nod to the character Friar Tuck, as well as the historical [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/rh/ftchar.htm Robert Stafford], a real-life chaplain linked to the name Friar Tuck in 1429.
*The term "Friar" refers to a man who is a member of a religious order which relies on charity, such as in Catholic Christianity. This ties in with the Friar's religious affiliation during his life.
*It is unknown why a monk would chose to become a ghost rather than move on. Pottermore states that he resented never being appointed cardinal. This may have been the unfinished business that made him choose to return as a ghost.
