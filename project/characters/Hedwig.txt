{{Quote|Very smart owl you've got there.|[[Tom]] noting Hedwig's impressive intelligence|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
'''Hedwig''' (d. [[27 July]] [[1997]]) was [[Harry Potter]]'s pet [[snowy owl]]. Hedwig was an eleventh birthday gift from [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to Harry. Hagrid purchased her at the [[Eeylops Owl Emporium]].<ref name="PS5" />

In addition to delivering mail, the typical use [[owl]]s are put to, Hedwig was also a close companion to Harry. She remained one of his closest friends right up to her death during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] at the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]].

==Biography==

===Purchase===
{{Quote|Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing.|Hedwig is gifted to [[Harry Potter]] in 1991|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

[[File:Hedwig.gif|250px|thumb|right|Hagrid introduces Hedwig to Harry in [[1991]]]]

In [[1991]], Hedwig was kept by the [[Eeylops Owl Emporium]], until she was purchased by [[Rubeus Hagrid]] while he was helping [[Harry Potter]] get school supplies. She was a [[Harry Potter's eleventh birthday|birthday]] present for Harry when he turned eleven. Harry was obviously delighted with his new pet and was very grateful to Hagrid.<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref> This was the first birthday present Harry had ever received, as the Dursleys never celebrated his birthday. He very quickly grew attached to her.<ref name="PS5" />

Harry decided to name her Hedwig after [[Hedwig (wizard)|an individual]] he saw mentioned in ''[[A History of Magic]]''. In the days before arriving for his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Harry avoided the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] by staying in his room. Hedwig stayed with him during this time, his only friend at [[4 Privet Drive]].<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref>

===Hogwarts years===
[[File:Giphy (17).gif|250px|thumb|left|Hedwig with Harry during his time at Hogwarts|alt=]]

Throughout her life, she fulfilled the traditional function of an owl by delivering mail for Harry. She spent her years at Hogwarts fulfilling her duties by getting and sending letters to many individuals. In [[1991]], Harry's first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], she would usually fly in during breakfast to nibble Harry's ear affectionately and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. The first letter she ever gave him was from [[Rubeus Hagrid]] inviting Harry to have a cup of tea and hear all about his first week at school.<ref name="PS8">{{PS|B|8}}</ref> At one point, she was tasked with sending [[Charles Weasley]] in [[Romania]] a letter asking if he can take [[Norberta]] the [[Norwegian Ridgeback]], Hagrid's temporary pet [[dragon]], to Romania.<ref name="PS14">{{PS|B|14}}</ref>

In the summer of [[1992]], they stayed at the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] in Privet Drive again. [[Vernon Dursley]] forced Harry to lock Hedwig in her cage, sometimes for weeks at a time to prevent Harry from sending messages to his "freaky little friends". Hedwig started to grow bored and frustrated, a feeling Harry mirrored. He felt forgotten by his friends and mused that Hedwig was the only proof he had that the wizarding world was real.<ref name="CS1">{{COS|B|1}}</ref> 

[[File:Hedwig, Seamus, Ron and Harry Potter (1991).JPG|250px|thumb|Hedwig delivers mail to Harry during breakfast |alt=]]

When Ron, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], arrived to rescue Harry from Privet Drive in the [[Flying Ford Anglia]], he nearly ended up forgetting Hedwig when he was getting into the car. She noticed and hooted, waking Vernon up. Harry had to run to get her and put her in the car too. He later let her out, and Hedwig flew behind the car all the way to [[The Burrow]].<ref name="CS3">{{COS|B|3}}</ref> In subsequent summers, Hedwig's frustrated hooting convinced the Dursleys to allow Harry to let her out to fly, on the condition that he didn't use her to send messages. However, Harry sometimes ignored this instruction. 

[[File:HarryPotterInBedWithWandMaraudersMapAndHedwig_Still.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hedwig in the Gryffindor boys' dormitory for [[third year]]s |alt=]]

In the summer of [[1993]], she took longer to get back to Privet Drive because she decided to fly to Hermione to get her birthday gift for Harry. On her way back, she had to help [[Errol]] get Ron's gift to Harry when he collapsed. She later went back to Hermione to deliver Harry's letter to her, and in her absence he abandoned Privet Drive and went to the [[Leaky Cauldron]]. Hedwig was very intelligent, and knew the place she needed to go. She arrived at the pub a few minutes earlier than he did. 

In the build-up to the [[Second Wizarding War]], Hedwig was constrained in what she could do for Harry, due to the fact that snowy owls aren't native to Britain, which made her conspicuous; this could potentially raise suspicions if onlookers witnessed a snowy owl always going back and forth from a specific location. A specific instance of this was during [[Sirius Black]]'s evasion of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[1994]]. Hedwig was keen to deliver messages, but Harry refused to put her at risk and this led to a minor falling out between them.

[[File:Hedwig 1994.gif|250px|thumb|Hedwig preparing to deliver a message to [[Sirius Black]] in 1994|alt=]]

In [[1995]], Hedwig was attacked by associates of [[Dolores Umbridge]] in an effort to intercept Harry's mail, requiring [[Dobby]] and [[Professor]] [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Grubby-Plank]] to nurse her back to health.<ref name="OOTP13">{{OOTP|B|13}}</ref> [[Lavender Brown]] once admitted to [[Parvati Patil]] that she always loved Hedwig and thought her so beautiful.<ref>{{OOTP|B|17}}</ref> In [[1996]], Hedwig brought Harry  a brand new copy of [[Advanced Potion-Making]] from [[Flourish and Blotts]], which was intended as a replacement for the [[Severus Snape's copy of Advanced Potion-Making|Half-blood prince's copy]], but he did not use it nonetheless.<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>

===Death===
{{Quote|No... ''NO!'' Hedwig... Hedwig...|Hedwig’s death causes Harry much grief|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Hedwig's death.JPG|left|thumb|249x249px|Hedwig's death]]
Hedwig was killed in [[1997]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. While aboard [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] flying motorcycle with Harry she was struck by a [[Killing Curse]], possibly aimed at Hagrid or Harry. She was killed instantly and fell like a rag doll to the bottom of her cage. To add insult to the injury of losing his much-loved companion, Harry was then forced to destroy the sidecar containing Hedwig's body in an effort to slow down the pursuing Death Eaters.<ref name="DH4">{{DH|B|4}}</ref> 

Harry was devastated by the loss of Hedwig. His friends were naturally deeply sympathetic and tried to comfort him. Hagrid consoled him by saying that Hedwig had lived "a great old life".<ref name="DH5">{{DH|B|5}}</ref>

===Post-mortem===
During the [[Calamity]] which happened across the [[wizarding world]] in the [[2010s]], a mysterious [[Foundable]] of Hedwig's memory appeared throughout the world, which was trapped in a [[Atmospheric Charm|whirlwind]] [[Confoundable]]. 

Volunteer [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] could free Hedwig by casting the [[counter-charm]] [[Meteolojinx Recanto]] to cancel the effects of the wind and have Hedwig's memory return to its rightful place.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

Following Hedwig's death, Harry continued to keep a snowy owl to honour her.<ref name="honour">https://stories.jkrowling.com/harrypotter/#question-6</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Hedwig's large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at him over the dead frog clamped in her beak... In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty that he'd been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend at he had at [[4 Privet Drive|number four, Privet Drive]].|Hedwig’s displeasure at Harry's treatment of her|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

Hedwig was a very intelligent, loyal and affectionate companion, and tended to show her affection by gently nibbling Harry's ears or fingers. She also demonstrated that she was fully capable of understanding his wishes and would faithfully follow his orders, such as when he instructed her to find and peck [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] to prompt them to write to him during the summer holidays. Hedwig obeyed Harry's requests and even pecked Ron and Hermione on Harry's orders, in order to get them to write back to him.<ref name="OP5">{{OOTP|B|5}}</ref>

Hedwig was a dignified and proud creature and was disapproving of less mature [[owl]]s such as Ron Weasley's [[Pigwidgeon]].<ref name="GF3">{{GOF|B|3}}</ref> She responded to the hyperactive behaviour she considered inappropriate by staring or hooting reproachfully. She would sometimes show her displeasure physically, turning her back on Harry (showing him her tail), cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended. 

In particular, she seemed disdainful when Harry had to stop using her to deliver messages to [[Sirius Black]] to avoid suspicion, which briefly effected their friendship. Hedwig would also make a lot of noise if she was locked in her cage for too long.<ref name="csfilm">{{COS|F}}</ref> 

Hedwig was a very intelligent owl. When Ron, [[Fred and George Weasley]] came to rescue Harry from the Dursleys in their [[Flying Ford Anglia]], she was still and silent so as to not wake up the Dursleys. She also screeched loudly to alert Harry when he almost forgot to take her with him into the car.<ref name="CS3">{{COS|B|3}}</ref> Her intelligence also once made her decide to fly to [[France]] to get Hermione's thirteenth birthday present to Harry while she was on holiday. Harry relocated to the [[Leaky Cauldron]] during Hedwig's journey and she knew. According to [[Tom]] the landlord, she arrived five minutes before Harry did.

Further evidence of Hedwig's resourcefulness was found in the fact that she didn't need a specific address to deliver messages - a name alone was sufficient. Hedwig was a keen hunter too and when possible, was allowed to fly outside free and catch food for herself, such as [[frog]]s.<ref name="OP3">{{OOTP|B|3}}</ref> She would also eat [[Eeylops Premium Owl Treats]].

==Etymology==
[[J. K. Rowling]] found the name St Hedwig in a book of medieval saints.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060316221406/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=76 J.K. Rowling Official Site - F.A.Q. (archived via Wayback Machine)]</ref> It's derived from Hedvig - a Scandinavian name meaning female warrior or battle.<ref>http://pagannames.witchipedia.com/hedvig</ref> There are two female saints named Hedwig:

*Saint {{w|Hedwig of Andechs}} (1174–1243), Duchess of [[Wikipedia:Silesia|Silesia]], who is the patron saint of orphans.
*Saint {{w|Hedwig of Poland|Hedwig (Jadwiga)}} (1373–1399), Queen (officially King) of Poland. A St Hedwig's Day dedicated to Hedwig of Andechs has been observed on [[October]] 16th every year since she was canonised in 1267.

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|I made a few elementary mistakes when it came to my depiction of Hedwig. Firstly, Snowy Owls are diurnal (ie, they fly by day). Secondly, they are virtually mute, so Hedwig’s frequent hoots and chirrups of approval and comfort should be taken as signs of her magically enhanced abilities. Thirdly, as countless well-meaning owl-lovers and experts kept writing to me in the early days, owls do not eat bacon (Hedwig enjoys a bit of bacon rind when she delivers post at breakfast).|J.K. Rowling|Pottermore}}

[[File:Hedwig_Plush.png|105px|thumb|Hedwig plush from The [[The Wizarding World of Harry Potter|Wizarding World of Harry Potter]]]]

*The death of Hedwig symbolised Harry's loss of innocence as he came of age.<ref>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/default.aspx?sec=3 Bloomsbury Live Chat]</ref>
*In the [[Harry Potter (book series)|Harry Potter novels]], [[J. K. Rowling]] writes that Hedwig ''hoots'', but, in real life, snowy owls actually ''bark''. The fact was pointed out to  Rowling after the publishing of {{PS}}. She admitted her mistake, but decided to leave Hedwig's vocalisation as a ''hoot'' in the latter books for continuity.
*In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], Hedwig is played by [[Gizmo]],<ref>''[http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=5802 Meet Gary Gero, Animal Trainer for Two Harry Potter Movies]''</ref> and his main stunt replacements, [[Ook]] and [[Sprout (owl)|Sprout]].<ref>''[http://www.mugglenet.com/movies/movie1/trivia.shtml First Movie Trivia]''</ref> Further owls were [[Kasper]], [[Swoops]], [[Oh Oh]], [[Elmo]] and [[Bandit]].
**Since the owls who played Hedwig were almost all male, her appearance in the movies is that of a male snowy owl, not a female one. A female would have much more dark spots (see image at right). The choice of using male owls was because they are smaller and therefore easier for young actors to handle.
**[[Ook]] was the first cast member to be chosen for a role in {{PS|FA}}.<ref>{{wikilink|Ook|lang=pt}}</ref> 

[[File:HedwigBrickheadz.JPG|105px|thumb|right|Hedwig in [[LEGO Brickheadz: Harry Potter]]]]

*A Hedwig plush is available for purchase at {{WWHP}}.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]], Hedwig delivers the [[Nimbus 2000]] [[broomstick]], purchased by [[Minerva McGonagall]], to Harry. In the book, however, 6 screech owls delivered it, not Hedwig.
*Rowling originally intended to make Hedwig open Harry's [[Golden Snitch]] in ''Deathly Hallows''.<ref>"[http://harryahistory.com/2008/08/hedwig-owl-of-a-different-fate.html Hedwig: Owl of a Different Fate?]" on the ''Harry, A History'' site</ref> She considers [[snowy owl]]s to be "the most beautiful [[owl]] of all," ergo her choice in Hedwig's colour.
*"[[Hedwig's Theme]]" is the musical leitmotif associated with Hedwig. Composed by [[John Williams]], it's percieved by many to be the Main Theme of the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter films]]'' and is featured in some form or another in many other tracks throughout the franchise.
*A deleted scene in {{COS|FA}} shows Harry asking Hedwig "Who am I, Hedwig? What am I?" after he learns that he is able to speak [[Parseltongue]].<ref name="comparison">[http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=4087653 Movie-Censorship.com - Comparison - Theatrical Version / Ultimate Edition - ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']</ref>
*In {{POA|FA}} when Harry arrives at the [[Leaky Cauldron]] Tom the barman refers to Hedwig as 'he'.
*Hedwig appears as a playable character in the console versions of the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|''Prisoner of Azkaban'' video game]].

[[File:Death Eater kills Hedwig.gif|200px|thumb|right|Hedwig's death in {{DH|F1}}]]

*In the {{DH|FA1}}, Hedwig dies when she tries to protect Harry and Hagrid from the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]'s attacks, being hit with a killing curse and her lifeless body spiralled down to the ground and all Harry could do was watch in grief. Hedwig was allowed to fly free behind Harry during the sequence, and her attempt to protect Harry and Hagrid was key in allowing the [[Death Eaters]] to identify him as the real [[Harry Potter]]. Her death in the film contradicts her death in the book, where she was killed by  a stray Killing Curse whilst kept in her cage.

*In the {{TCG}}, [[Hedwig (Trading Card)|Hedwig]] is listed as a [[Gryffindor]]. No other creatures (excluding the house emblems) have Hogwarts houses in the game, not even [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]], who actually attended Hogwarts and was sorted into Gryffindor.
*On 17 August, 2009, The [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/ Telegraph] [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/harry-potter/6042159/Owl-crop-circle-appears-in-Wiltshire-field.html reports] that a new series of mysterious crop-circles (patterns cut in farmers fields) have appeared on that summer in fields in [[Wiltshire]], and the most recent is the 400 foot pattern, they wrote it as a tribute to the late Hedwig from the [[Harry Potter (book series)|Harry Potter series]].<ref>''[http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/2009/8/17/who-cast-the-owl-crop-circle-spell Who Cast the Owl Crop Circle Spell?]''</ref>

After the release of {{DH}}, they posted the results of the odds on their website, and also listed Hedwig with 1/1000 and the note "Just kidding."<ref name="scorecard">[https://web.archive.org/web/20131030195224/http://www.mugglenet.com/dhscorecard.shtml ''Deathly Hallows'' Scorecard- Mugglenet] (via the Internet Archive)</ref>
