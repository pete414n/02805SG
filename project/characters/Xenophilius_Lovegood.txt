'''Xenophilius "Xeno" Lovegood''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who worked as the editor of ''[[The Quibbler]]'' magazine, the husband of [[Pandora Lovegood|Pandora]], and the father of [[Luna Lovegood]]. His wife died when their only child was nine years old, and he raised his daughter by himself. He was likely the source of his daughter’s eccentric beliefs, although he was often correct in his assumptions. He believed in the existence of the Deathly Hallows and supported [[Harry Potter|Harry]] in ''The Quibbler'' when few others would.

Xenophilius and Luna lived in a [[Lovegood House|house]] shaped like a rook chess piece near the village of [[Ottery St Catchpole]] and were friends with the [[Weasley family]]. In the summer of [[1997]], Xenophilius and Luna attended [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] at [[the Burrow]]. In [[1998]], Luna was kidnapped by [[Death Eaters]]. To save her, Xenophilius betrayed Harry Potter to Death Eaters. Harry, accompanied by [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] managed to escape. Lovegood was temporarily imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] by the Death Eaters.

After the [[Second Wizarding War]], he left the prison and continued editing ''The Quibbler''. When Luna married [[Rolf Scamander]], Xenophilius had two grandsons, [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]] and [[Lysander Scamander|Lysander]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Xenophilius Lovegood standing on stairs in house.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Xenophilius Lovegood standing inside his unusual home]]
Xenophilius was born into the [[Lovegood family]] and attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] where he was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]]. At an unknown time he married [[Pandora Lovegood]] with whom he had a daughter, [[Luna Lovegood]]. He raised Luna himself after an accident during magical experimentation took Pandora's life.<ref name="OOTP38"/>

===''The Quibbler''===
Xenophilius created a magazine called ''[[The Quibbler]]'', in which he wrote about his obscure beliefs, including the [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]].<ref name="OOTP10"/><ref name="OOTP13">{{OOTP|B|13}}</ref>

At some point during his life, Xenophilius attended one of [[Eldred Worple]]'s book signings. He presumably shared his bizarre beliefs with Worple, not to mention his choice of clothing and accessories, as the latter remembered him as a "seriously ''unbalanced'' man".<ref name="script">Mentioned on the [http://web.archive.org/web/20091122084428/http://warnerbros2009.warnerbros.com/assets/screenplays/hpathbp_screenplay.pdf ''Half-Blood Prince'' script] released on the [http://warnerbros2009.warnerbros.com/#/movies/harrypotter/foryourconsideration/ Warner Bros. Awards website]</ref>

[[File:HM Xenophilius Lovegood.jpg|180px|thumb|Xenophilius Lovegood in the Three Broomsticks]]
During the [[1988–1989 school year]], Xenophilius heard a rumour that a [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]] had been spotted near [[Hogwarts Castle]]. He visited the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] and offered 87 [[Galleon]]s in exchange for a picture of the creature, which he planned to include on the front page of an upcoming issue of ''The Quibbler''. As time was running out, he eventually agreed to accept a picture of another magical creature as well. He gave the reward money to [[Chiara Lobosca]], [[Barnaby Lee]] and [[Jacob's sibling]] in exchange for a [[Photo of Sir Ribbithe and Caelan|picture]] of a [[Quintaped]].<ref name="HM5">{{HM|5|THE QUIBBLER: FIGHT FOR THE FRONT PAGE}}</ref>

In [[1994]], Xenophilius and Luna watched the final of the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]; [[Ireland]] vs [[Bulgaria]].<ref name="GOF6">{{GOF|B|6}}</ref>

In [[1996]], Xenophilius published [[Harry Potter]]'s story about the [[24 May|night]] he saw [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] and sent Harry a free copy.<ref name="OOTP25">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref> This was the fastest-selling edition of ''[[The Quibbler]]'', even being reprinted at least once before Mr Lovegood sold the story to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. [[Lovegood family|The Lovegoods]] used the money received from selling the story to the ''Prophet'' to travel to [[Sweden]] over the summer to search for a [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]].<ref name="OOTP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>

When [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] became [[Minister for Magic]], Xenophilius planned to print a story in ''The Quibbler'' stating that Scrimgeour was in fact a [[vampire]]. However the Ministry stepped in and prevented him from printing the story; Xenophilius believed that this was because the Ministry did not want the truth to get out.<ref name="HBP15">{{HBP|B|15}}</ref>

===Second Wizarding War===
====Bill and Fleur's wedding====
{{Quote|What is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelette!|[[Muriel]] criticising Lovegood at the wedding|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Deathly Hallows - Harry, Luna and X Lovegood.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Xeno and Luna talking with Harry Potter]]
In the summer of [[1997]], Xenophilius and Luna Lovegood attended [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] at [[the Burrow]]. There, Xenophilius got into an argument with [[Viktor Krum]] over the [[Xenophilius Lovegood's necklace|necklace]] he was wearing; Viktor identified it as the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Sign of the Deathly Hallows|Gellert Grindelwald's mark]].<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref>

With the fall of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] under the control of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], the ''[[Daily Prophet|Daily Prohet's]]'' enterprises were seized by the [[Death Eaters]]. ''The Quibbler'', however, continued as usual and Xenophilius made his support of [[Harry Potter]] clear.<ref name="DH20"/>

====Daughter's ransom====
{{Quote|They took my Luna because of what I've been writing. They took my Luna and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her back to me if I — If I... I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave.|Luna's kidnapping by Death Eaters as a bargaining chip|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Xenophilius's public support of Harry Potter eventually got him in trouble with [[Death Eaters]]. Many speculated why the Death Eaters had let him get away with it for so long. They kidnapped his daughter and held her hostage at [[Malfoy Manor]]. Xenophilius intended to do whatever it took to get her back. He agreed to publish anti-Potter articles in the Quibbler, following the line of the Voldemort-dominated Ministry, with Harry being depicted as Undesirable No. 1 on the front page of his magazine.<ref name="DH21"/>

[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-xeno_trio.jpg|250px|thumb|Xenophilius Lovegood discussing the Deathly Hallows with the trio]]
When he was visited by Harry, Ron, and Hermione later in the year,<ref name="DH20"/> Xenophilius [[Ambush at the Lovegood House|alerted Death Eaters]], hoping they would return Luna in exchange. While waiting for the Death Eaters' arrival, Xenophilius told the trio about the [[Deathly Hallows]]. He explained that the symbol was worn by believers and seekers of the Hallows to identify themselves to one another. When Harry grew suspicious of him after realising that Luna had not been home in some time, Xenophilius attempted to [[Stunning Spell|stun]] Harry and his friends. Harry pushed Hermione and Ron out of the way, causing him to miss. Instead the spell hit an [[erumpent]] horn, which caused the [[Exploding Fluid|fluid]] inside it to explode, causing his house to collapse inward.<ref name="DH21">{{DH|B|21}}</ref>

[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-xeno_death_eaters.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Xeno attempting to hand Harry Potter over to the [[Death Eaters]]]]
The Death Eaters [[Travers]] and [[Selwyn]] arrived and briefly tortured Xenophilius, believing that he was trying to trick them about Harry being at his home. After the [[Human-presence-revealing spell]] revealed that there were others in the house, the Death Eaters sent Xenophilius up the stairs. Hermione rapidly [[Memory Charm|wiped his memory]] of what they had discussed with him, and then [[Deprimo|blasted a hole]] through the floor to facilitate the trio's escape, engineering it so that the Death Eaters saw that Harry was indeed there, thus ensuring that neither Xenophilius nor Luna were punished for lying, and so that neither saw Ron, who was supposed to be at home sick with [[spattergroit]].<ref name="DH21"/>

====Imprisonment and release====
After the [[trio]]'s escape, Xenophilius was arrested and sent to [[Azkaban]]. His attempted betrayal was unknown, with the anti-Potter issue of the Quibbler buried under the debris of his home and never distributed. He was released after Voldemort's death defeat on the [[2 May]] of [[1998]]. Luna, in the meantime, was rescued by the [[house-elf]] [[Dobby]] from [[Malfoy Manor]], meaning they both survived the [[Second Wizarding War|war]]. Harry, Ron and Hermione preserved Xenophilius's reputation and never revealed the truth, as his attempted betrayal had been motivated solely by concern for his daughter.

===Later life===
As an adult, Luna would soon come to realise the truth about her father, and accepted that some of his creatures did not exist. She married [[Rolf Scamander]], grandson of the famous [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], and the couple had twins, [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]] and [[Lysander Scamander|Lysander]], thus making Xenophilius a grandfather.

It is not known what happened to Xenophilius beyond this, except that when his daughter travelled to the [[Patagonian Desert]], in [[Argentina]], to attend the final of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]], in July [[2014]], Lorcan and Lysander were left at home "with grandpa", which may have meant Xenophilius or the twins' paternal grandfather ([[Newton Scamander]]'s son or son-in-law).

==Physical appearance==
Xenophilius was an eccentric-looking [[Wizardkind|wizard]], who looked slightly cross-eyed and had shoulder length hair that was the texture of candyfloss.<ref name="DH8"/>

At [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]], he wore a cap with a tassel that dangled in front of his nose, and wore a golden chain around his neck, that bore the sign of the [[Deathly Hallows]], sometimes mistaken as the [[Gellert Grindelwald's sign|mark]] of [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. He also wore robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow, which [[Muriel]] said made him look like an omelette.<ref name="DH8"/>

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|I mean, you could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody's proved it doesn't exist!|Xenophilius Lovegood|Yes, you could. I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.|Xenophilius speaking to a frustrated [[Hermione Granger]] about the Deathly Hallows|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Tumblr msnkb49UxM1r82muqo7 250.gif|250px|thumb|left|Xenophilius dancing with Luna at the wedding]]
Xenophilius cared a great deal about his daughter [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], and shared her bizarre beliefs; he was likely the cause of them. He thought the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' was an awful paper, and only published stories that he thought were important and needed to be known by the public. He was extremely firm in his beliefs and felt those who disbelieve in them were "painfully limited", "narrow" and "close-minded". Every time a sceptic demanded the evidence for his beliefs, he in turn asked them to prove them untrue themselves.<ref name="DH8"/>

Due to his bizarre views, many in the wizarding world thought he was senile. [[Eldred Worple]] even remembered him as a "seriously unbalanced man" after meeting him at one of his book signings.<ref name="script"/> According to Luna, her father did not care about making money and did not pay people to write for ''[[The Quibbler]]''; she claimed they did so because it was an honour to see their name in print. Luna also said that her father was supportive of any anti-[[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] action. Mr Lovegood fully supported [[Harry Potter]] and encouraged others to do so as well, until his daughter was kidnapped by Death Eaters. Xenophilius cared about Luna so much that he was willing to hand Harry, Ron and Hermione over to the Death Eaters in exchange for his daughter. Because of his predicament, Xenophilius was rather nervous and reclusive when the Trio visited him, leading Ron and Hermione to accuse him of cowardice and hypocrisy, and later the former even calling Xenophilius treacherous, only reluctantly retracting that claim when Harry reminded of Luna's abduction.<ref name="DH21"/>

Xenophilius believed in the [[Deathly Hallows]], (which actually proved to be real), as well as numerous magical cryptids such as [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]]s. He also believed that [[gnome]]s had powerful magic,<ref name="DH8"/> and that the [[dirigible plum]] would enhance one's ability to accept the extraordinary. Although he sought the Deathly Hallows, given his personality, he was likely interested in them more as a matter of curiosity about such unusual objects, rather than a desire to actually possess or use them.

Given his tendency to believe in anything dubious and ridiculous, Xenophilius sometimes became the subject of pranks, such as when a young wizard gave him an Erumpent horn and claimed that it belonged to a Crumple-Horned Snorkack. Unbeknownst to Lovegood, the Erumpent horn would explode if given even the slightest touch. This also shows that he was ignorant about some magical [[creature]]s, as he was unable to identify the horn at first glance.<ref name="DH21"/>

In addition, Xenophilius could be seen as a poor businessman, for not paying anyone for their articles under the naive belief that witches and wizards seeing their names in ''The Quibbler'' would be satisfaction enough. Along with the poor reputation of his magazine, this served as further disincentive for anyone to submit their writing for Xenophilus's review.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Love]]''': Xenophilius loved his daughter Luna and cared about her safety and welfare immensely, as he was distraught when the [[Death Eaters]] kidnapped her for ransom in [[1998]]. He was even willing to betray [[Harry Potter]] to them, in the hopes of them releasing Luna and being reunited with her. This shows what drastic and desperate lengths Xenophilius was willing to go to keep his daughter safe from harm, by going as far as betraying his own beliefs and cause.<ref name="DH21"/> He would have been heart-broken following the tragic [[death]] of his wife [[Pandora Lovegood|Pandora]],<ref name="OOTP38"/> showing him to have been an incredibly loving and caring father and husband indeed.
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Xenophilius grew various [[magic]]al plants in his garden, such as [[Dirigible plum]]s and [[Snargaluff]]s, showing he had knowledge of magical plants and how to grow and handle them.<ref name="DH20"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Xenophilius could cast a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]],<ref name="LEGOY2"/> which was a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability, given the immense difficulty of casting the charm. He could also cast simpler charms such as the [[Hover Charm]] successfully, and was also capable of casting a particularly powerful [[Stunning Spell]].<ref name="DH21"/>
*'''[[Study of Ancient Runes]]''': In the [[July]] or [[August]] edition in [[1995]], ''[[The Quibbler]]'' published a segment written in ancient [[rune]]s,<ref name="OOTP10">{{OOTP|B|10}}</ref> meaning he had some understanding of ancient runic languages, and that he may have even studied the subject at Hogwarts.
*'''Journalism''': Xenophilius was the editor of ''The Quibbler'', and in the tabloid he published various bizarre and often unproven conspiracy theories.<ref name="OOTP10"/> Despite the often ridiculous nature of ''The Quibbler''<nowiki/>'s content, he was still implied to be a skilled journalist and writer nonetheless, as they were those who truly believed his wild tales and theories.

==Possessions==
[[File:Xenophilius Lovegood wand.png|150px|thumb|Xenophilius's wand]]
*'''[[Xenophilius Lovegood's wand|Wand]]''': Xenophilius's wand was of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] materials. He or his parents likely purchased it prior to his [[first year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].
*'''[[Xenophilius Loevgood's dress robes|Dress robes]]''': Xenophilius Lovegood wore brightly-coloured dress robes to the [[wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour]], along with the symbol of the [[Deathly Hallows]]. He explained that wearing sun colours to a wedding was believed to be good luck. His daughter, [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], wore the same colours to the wedding.<ref name="DH8"/>
*'''[[Xenophilius Lovegood's necklace|Necklace]]''': This was an ornament that he wore to Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding. Some, like [[Viktor Krum]] suspected him of being a [[Dark Wizard]], but actually the necklace simply bore the symbol of the [[Deathly Hallows]].<ref name="DH8"/>
*'''[[Lovegood House|House]]''': The Lovegood House was a black-coloured cylindrical house on top of a hill with a stream at the base of it, located near the village of [[Ottery St Catchpole]]. It was the home of Xenophilius and and his daughter Luna during Luna's childhood.<ref name="DH20">{{DH|B|20}}</ref>
*'''[[Erumpent horn]]''': Xenophilius owned an Erumpent horn that he claimed to be the horn of a [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]]. He proudly displayed it and accidentally blew it up, which resulted in his house being torn apart.<ref name="DH21"/>
*'''[[Bust of Rowena Ravenclaw]]''': This bust of [[Rowena Ravenclaw]] was created by Xenophilius Lovegood, who was trying to recreate the [[magic]]al properties of her diadem.<ref name="DH21"/>

==Etymology==
Xenophilius's name comes from two Greek words: ''Xenos'' "strange" and ''-Phile'' "love". As opposed to xenophobe, one who fears the strange and foreign, his name means "one who loves the strange".

==Behind the scenes==
*In the {{DH|F1}}, Xenophilius is played by [[Wales|Welsh]] actor [[Rhys Ifans]].
*In {{DH|F1}}, Xenophilius triggers the [[Taboo]], which leads to the capture of [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], which differs from the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|book]], where Harry triggers the Taboo.
*It is possible that Xenophilius and [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]] fought the Death Eaters at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour]] after it was attacked.
**In [[LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7]], he is indeed one of the combatants during the Weasley wedding.
