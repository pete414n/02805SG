'''Grawp''' (b. post [[1931]]) was a [[giant]] that was known for his small stature and short height; although he stood at sixteen feet tall, this was considered short by giant standards. He was the son of [[Fridwulfa]] and an [[Grawp's father|unnamed giant]] and, therefore, the maternal half-brother of [[Rubeus Hagrid]].



Around [[1931]], the [[giant]]ess [[Fridwulfa]] abandoned her human husband [[Rubeus Hagrid's father|Mr Hagrid]] and their infant child [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. Rubeus was was a half-gaint and therefore smaller in stature than she wanted at ten feet tall. She consequently rejoined her own kind in the mountains, and there she found a new mate. 

The two gave birth to the giant Grawp who was a full-blooded giant, but still particularly small  for a giant. Due to his small stature he was abandoned as well. He was frequently bullied by the other giants thereafter due to his small size.




[[Rubeus Hagrid]], along with his newly-found friend [[Olympe Maxime]], paid a visit to a [[Giant colony|tribe of giants]] in June of 1995, on the orders of headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in an attempt to bring the giants over as allies of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] in the war against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].

After three days at the giant camp, Hagrid discovered his half-brother Grawp. He later dragged Grawp back to [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] with him due to the bullying he knew Grawp had received, and presumably to protect Grawp from Voldemort's enslavement of the giants. Despite his previous abuse, Grawp continuously attempted to return to the camp, but Hagrid forced him through [[England]] against his will.

Hagrid kept Grawp in the [[Forbidden Forest]] for months, teaching him manners and pieces of English as they went. 






During a [[Quidditch]] match in 1996, in which [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] played as [[Keeper]], Hagrid secretly revealed Grawp's presence to [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]], asking them to look after Grawp in case he got sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]], who was strictly against half-breeds as well as creatures like giants. Despite their disapproval of Grawp's presence, they agreed in the end. After Hagrid was later temporarily sacked by Umbridge, Grawp became upset about his absence and after chasing the [[Forbidden Forest Centaur colony|centaurs]] away from Harry and Hermione before they could attack them, demanded about Hagrid's presence from Hermione, who responded that she didn't know where he was.

After [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s return and Umbridge's sacking from Hogwarts, Grawp was later reunited with Hagrid and was later sent by Dumbledore and Hagrid to live in the mountains near [[Hogsmeade]], presumably in the [[Cave near Hogsmeade|cave]] where Hagrid hid after his sacking by Umbridge, with Hagrid commenting he was far happier there than in the Forest. Hagrid additionally considered getting a female giant for Grawp to socialise with, something Harry usually would have protested against but was unable to do so due to his grief over [[Sirius Black]]'s death.

Grawp also proved to be an indirect factor to Harry, Ron and Hermione discontinuing [[Care of Magical Creatures]] once they began their sixth year as they disapproved of Hagrid's idea to train Grawp to be his teaching assistant alongside Hagrid's tendancy to teach dangerous creatures over more amicable ones.






By the next year, Grawp had become much more docile and lost his violent edge. He attended the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore]], standing in clothes the size of mar-quees. By this time he had developed a large sense of compassion. During the funeral his head was bent with sorrow, and he patted his half-brother to comfort him. This caused Grawp to unintentionally smash Hagrid into the ground due to his immense strength. 

After the funeral ended, Grawp was seen embracing Hagrid, who was still grieving over Dumbledore's death.




In [[March]] of 1998, he and his brother ran from the [[Death Eaters]] due to the two of them having held a [[Support Harry Potter party]] at Hagrid's hut. This was illegal due to the school being controlled by Death Eaters. Afterwards they hid in the [[Cave near Hogsmeade]] for the remainder of the war.



On [[1 May]] of that same year, Hagrid and Grawp heard [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s magically enhanced voice from their cave. Voldemort was delivering an ultimatum of handing [[Harry Potter]] over to him or else a battle would start. Grawp carried Hagrid and their boarhound [[Fang]], smashing right through the boundaries and then launching Hagrid and Fang together as one through the window of the [[first-floor corridor|first-floor corridor.]] In the first-floor corridor, Harry was wandering. After greeting Harry, Hagrid and Grawp stumbled off to join the fight below.

Later on, Grawp was seen alive but very angry, attacking Voldemort's giants head-first as he roared in fury. Aided by [[Buckbeak]] and the [[thestral]]s, they were quickly defeated and Grawp moved on to helping others in the fight as reinforcements arrived.

Grawp eventually survived the battle, and students threw food into his laughing mouth as they celebrated the recent victory in the battle but mourned the loss of the [[Fallen Fifty|dead]].


At the start of the [[2009â€“2010 school year]], Grawp still stayed at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] with [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who made a [[butter-fly pie]] for Grawp. In the winter of that year, he destroyed a snowman that students were building. The giant footprints left on the scene led some to believe it was done by a [[Yeti]], and they still thought Grawp was one upon meeting him and had a brief fight, but Hagrid cleared the matter up by introducing Grawp as his half-brother.




At sixteen feet, Grawp was considered short for a giant. He had grey skin, brown-green eyes and hair and appeared like a little mound of land when laid.




Grawp was aggressive and violent, both common traits for a true giant and was known to attack [[Rubeus Hagrid|his brother]] when in a foul mood.

Grawp initially had great difficulties learning to trust Hagrid, however, as it took nearly a year to gain his trust. The language barrier may have been a factor in this since Hagrid could only speak English and, after nearly a year, Grawp could barely speak comprehensible English. After nearly three years, he could still only just talk properly, and could not pronounce long or difficult words such as "[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]]", which he said as "Hermy", and "[[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]", which he pronounced as "Hagger".

However, while his language skills were still barely comprehensible, Grawp's personality on the other hand changed immensely under Hagrid's influence, despite doubts that Hagrid's efforts were completely futile. By the time he attended the funeral of [[Albus Dumbledore]], Grawp became more kind, gentle, and compassionate. He showed sorrow during the funeral and attempted to comfort Hagrid, who was more devastated by Dumbledore's death, by patting and embracing him (though causing Hagrid's chair to sink into the ground). 

Grawp also showed happiness and joy after [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s final defeat, demonstrating that he had developed an understanding of human emotions. However, while most of his violent side was lost, he still retained some of it when he fought against the other giants during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].
