'''Lavender Brown''' (c. [[1979]]/[[1980]] – [[2 May]] [[1998]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the daughter of [[Lavender Brown's father|Mr]] and [[Lavender Brown's mother|Mrs Brown]], and sorted into [[Gryffindor]]. She started her education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]], the same year as the famous [[Harry Potter]].

While at Hogwarts Lavender began studying [[Divination]], which she was fascinated by. In her fifth year she joined [[Dumbledore's Army]]. This was an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter, despite initially doubting Harry's claims that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had [[Return of Lord Voldemort|returned]]. The following year she started a relationship with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], though they soon broke up.

In her final year of schooling Lavender joined the reconstituted D.A. to oppose [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] control of Hogwarts and fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. During the battle she was savaged by [[Lycanthropy|werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]] and died of her injuries.



Lavender was born in [[1979]] or [[1980]] to [[Lavender Brown's father|Mr]] and [[Lavender Brown's mother|Mrs Brown]]. Since she was a [[pure-blood]], all four of her grandparents must have been [[Wizardkind|wizards]].

She received her [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|acceptance letter]] from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] at age eleven, and purchased her equipment from [[Diagon Alley]] before the start of her first year.


First year




Lavender began attending Hogwarts in [[1991]], the same year as famous wizard [[Harry Potter]], at the age of eleven and was the first of the [[first year]]s to be [[Sorting Hat|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]], much to the delight of her peers.

She shared a dormitory with [[Hermione Granger]], [[Parvati Patil]], and two other girls and soon became best friends with Parvati. However, she did not get along as well with Hermione as she did with the other three girls. Hermione was believed by most to be a loner and made friends with boys rather than girls. There were also personality clashes between Hermione and the other Gryffindor girls; Hermione, being rather studious, may have been better suited with [[Ravenclaw]] girls.

Second year

In her second year, Lavender was one of the students present in [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]]' [[History of Magic]] class when Hermione asked about the [[Chamber of Secrets]]; like the rest of the class, Lavender paid much more attention at this point, even rising her head off her arms.

Lavender attended [[Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]]'s [[Duelling Club]], and when Lockhart was [[Disarming Charm|disarmed]] by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], she handed him back his [[wand]]. It is likely that Lavender, given her common nature had a crush on Professor Lockhart, as did many of the other female students even including Hermione Granger, and would be shocked to discover he was a fraud at the end of the year.

Third year

In her third year, Lavender started [[Divination]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]] classes. When Divination Professor [[Sybill Trelawney]] saw a [[Grim]] (a death omen in the form of a spectral dog) while seeking divinatory insight in the dregs of tea in the bottom of Harry's tea cup, Lavender was amongst the very few students in the class who, like Harry and [[Dean Thomas]] (both students who grew up with Muggles and unaware of magic until their letters arrived), did not initially know what Grims were.



She soon developed a good relationship with Professor Trelawney, who accurately predicted — or guessed — the death of Lavender's pet rabbit named [[Binky]]. The professor said that what Lavender was dreading would occur on the [[16 October|sixteenth of October]], and on that day, Lavender received news that her rabbit, who had been a baby at the time, had been mauled to death by a fox. Hermione pointed out that Lavender could not possibly have dreaded something unexpected and that the death must have happened days before the news arrived, but Lavender had faith in Trelawney's abilities and was upset by Hermione's rather tactless attempt at comforting her.

Fourth year


 that Lavender attended with Seamus Finnigan]]

During her fourth year, Hogwarts hosted the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. This tournament was a series of challenges for wizards to enter if they believed themselves capable. There was also an age restriction on who was allowed to enter the tournament. Fourth year [[Harry Potter]] was selected as the Hogwarts champion, along with Hufflepuff [[Cedric Diggory]]. As one of the traditions, the tournament held a ball and Lavender attended the Yule Ball with fellow Gryffindor student [[Seamus Finnigan]], likely just as friends. Her best friend [[Parvati Patil|Parvati]] ended up going as Harry's date.

That same year, when Care of Magical Creatures professor [[Rubeus Hagrid]] attempted to see if [[Blast-Ended Skrewt]]s hibernated (which they did not), Lavender demonstrated her Gryffindor courage by staying to help collect the runaways. She, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and other Gryffindors did this instead of fleeing into the hut like the [[Slytherin]]s. The Skrewts singed her school robes in the process. It is safe to say that Lavender and her classmates did not enjoy this lesson.
) teaching the Unforgivable Curses to fourth years]]
Later that year, Barty Crouch Jnr, in disguise as [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor  [[Alastor Moody|Moody]], used the [[Imperius Curse]] on her in class, thus forcing her to humiliate herself publicly by imitating a squirrel. Hermione Granger was not impressed that [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] had the nerve to teach the three Unforgivable Curses in school and was appalled when he demonstrated them on students. She didn't come to the aid of Lavender when she was being humiliated, but she did stick up for [[Neville Longbottom]] when he was horrified by the demonstration of the Cruciatus Curse on a spider.
|alt]]
At the end of the year, Lavender would attend the leaving feast. This feast was held as a memorial service to the late [[Cedric Diggory]]. Cedric was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on the orders of Lord Voldemort, during the third task of the Triwizard Tournament. During this service, Albus Dumbledore took the liberty upon himself to inform the students of Hogwarts that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was at large once again. It is unknown how Lavender took this news after it was first announced.

Fifth year

In her fifth year, when [[Harry Potter]] announced the return of Lord Voldemort, Lavender, like many others, initially believed the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] propaganda that Harry was lying, much to her room-mate Hermione's irritation. On the second day of the school year, [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]]'s public of support of Harry and his claims seemed to force her to begin to question her own beliefs. 

It is possible that [[Seamus Finnigan]], a fellow [[Gryffindor]] may have been putting doubts into her head also as he strongly supported the Ministry and Lavender was close with Seamus. The same year, [[Dolores Umbridge]] was appointed the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|DADA]] professor as a way for the Ministry at large to keep tabs on Hogwarts. meeting|alt]]
However, despite the claims that Harry had been lying, Lavender was one of the first students to arrive at the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] for the first meeting of what would become Dumbledore's Army. She learned many different defensive and offensive charms from Harry. When the D.A. practised casting the highly advanced [[Patronus Charm]], Lavender was only able to achieve puffs of silver vapour, and was becoming increasingly frustrated that she could not do it. 

Later on in the year, High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge began inspecting the teachers of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and Lavender was saddened when Professor Trelawney was temporarily sacked by Umbridge after her inspection, and even brought her some nice daffodils, though she continued to take the class under the [[centaur]] [[Firenze]], upon whom both she and Parvati had a crush, despite him being half-man and half-horse. This year Lavender took her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exams and practised basic [[Locomotion Charm]]s with Parvati the week leading up to the exams.

Sixth year

Lavender achieved a high grade on her O.W.L. exams for: [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Charms (class)|Charms]], and [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], as she attended [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level classes in these subjects. However, she did not continue on with [[Potions (class)|Potions]]. Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were the only [[Gryffindor]]s who attended N.E.W.T.-level class for that subject. It is also likely that she achieved a high mark in [[Divination (class)|Divination]] as well, given her passion for the subject.

's exhibitionist relationship|alt]]

By the beginning of her sixth year, Lavender had developed a crush on Ron Weasley. She complimented him, flirted with him, and wished him luck in his [[Quidditch]] games. After a particularly good performance in one of those games, Ron and Lavender ended up kissing. This greatly upset [[Hermione Granger]], as she had hoped Ron would attend [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] with her and she had expected a more than platonic relationship to develop between them. It is unclear if Lavender was aware of her room-mate's feelings for Ron, though it seems likely that she would not have gotten involved with Ron if she realised that he was dating her largely to make Hermione jealous.



The two dated for a few months, and were often seen kissing enthusiastically in public. For Christmas, Lavender sent Ron a gaudy [[Ronald Weasley's sweetheart necklace|necklace]] which read 'My Sweetheart' dangling from a chain. He disliked it immensely and after the holidays, their relationship began to go downhill. Lavender was very upset when Ron was poisoned, and when he increasingly pulled away from her. He feigned sleep when she came to visit him in the [[Hospital Wing]], avoided her, and became visibly annoyed with her affections.



Worried that her relationship with Ron was fading, she sought out the advice of his best friend, [[Harry Potter]]. She would talk to Harry about Ron's feelings, making him feel uncomfortable. Ron also reconciled with Hermione and spent increasing amounts of time with her, making Lavender suspicious. After she saw Ron and Hermione leave the [[Gryffindor]] dormitory seemingly alone (since Harry was under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]]) she ended their relationship, much to Ron's relief. She attended [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's funeral]] at the end of the year.

Seventh year


During her final year at Hogwarts, Lavender joined the second [[Dumbledore's Army]] to oppose [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] control of the school. She most likely took part in the disruptions the D.A. were responsible for throughout the year. Like others, she eventually took to hiding in the [[Room of Requirement]]. She may have been responsible for it forming a bathroom with washing facilities.

Battle of Hogwarts and death
 and later dying because of it]]
Lavender fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, along with other members of the D.A. She was most likely one of the many students who defended Harry when [[Pansy Parkinson]] wanted to hand him over to Lord Voldemort. During the battle she fell from a balcony and was attacked and savaged by [[werewolf]] Fenrir Greyback. 

Rushing to her aid, Hermione blasted Greyback away from her with a powerful spell. Professor Trelawney, then dropped a [[crystal ball]] on his head. Immediately after the attack, she was seen feebly stirring, but later died from her injuries.






Lavender was a somewhat silly and sentimental girl, She was also known to squeal and giggle at certain things and did so frequently. She could also be insensitive and childish, acting very possessive and over-protective of Ron when she was his girlfriend, even going so far as to say he looked "interesting" when he was poisoned. 

She frequently expressed her feelings for him in odd ways, such as calling him "Won-Won", sending him a necklace that made him cringe, writing his name in smog on the [[Hogwarts Express]], and snogging him on a continuous basis, not infrequently in public view. Inevitably, her heart was always in the right place, but she had a tendency to offend or annoy other people, if not always deliberately.


 tryout|alt]]
She had a great interest in Divination despite the subject being "woolly" and had reverence for Professor [[Trelawney family|Trelawney]], even though she was something of a fraud. This implied that she was gullible, often taking Trelawney's words to heart. Additionally, she initially believed the Ministry's propaganda against [[Harry Potter]], but she eventually began to doubt the Ministry's claims, hugely because of her friends' influence.

Much of her personality heavily implies that her social skills may have been poor. This is supported by the fact that she only had one known friend at school, [[Parvati Patil]], and they often had awkward interactions at the expense of others. However, even Parvati was uncomfortable by the fact that her relationship with Ron was becoming increasingly unhealthy. She stood quite in contrast with the more pragmatic and socially stable [[Hermione Granger]].




*'''[[Divination]]''': Lavender was very interested in the field of Divination, and shared a close relationship with [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]]. It was implied that she was good at Divination, and most likely took the [[Divination (class)|subject]] to N.E.W.T.-level, given her keen enthusiasm expressed in class.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Lavender advanced to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], showing aptitude in the subject. She must have achieved either an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' or an '[[Outstanding]]' on her O.W.L. exam.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Lavender attended N.E.W.T. [[Charms (class)|Charms]], meaning she achieved a high grade on her O.W.L. exam. and was able to cast the simple [[Locomotion Charm]].
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Lavender was a committed and loyal member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] which she joined in her fifth year, and therefore learned how to cast numerous defensive and offensive [[spell]]s under [[Harry Potter]]'s masterful teaching. She also received a high mark in her O.W.L. in the subject, which allowed her to study it further at N.E.W.T.-level, showing her proficiency in this field.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Lavender bravely fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Death Eaters]], showing she was a skilled duellist to an extent with talent in [[martial magic]], but she was unfortunately not strong enough to fend off [[Fenrir Greyback]] who killed her in the battle.


*'''[[Lavender Brown's wand|Wand]]''': Lavender's wand was of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. Like most wizards and witches in [[Great Britain]], she most likely purchased her wand at age eleven from [[Ollivanders]].
*'''[[Binky]]''': Lavender owned a male [[rabbit]] called Binky as a pet, which she presumably got prior or in the early [[1990s]]. In [[1993]], he was killed by a [[fox]], which saddened Lavender very much.
*'''''[[Unfogging the Future]]''''': Lavender owned a copy of this popular [[Divination]] book, as a student of [[Divination (class)|Divination]] at Hogwarts.





, her best friend|alt]]

Parvati Patil was Lavender's best friend and room-mate, and was often seen in her company. The two seemed to share many interests and character traits, including a keen interest in [[Divination]], as well as a fondness for more appealing types of magical creatures, like [[unicorn]]s. They were also brave as they were both sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house.

The two were often seen giggling and gossiping together during their school days, and shared a friendship with [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]]. Parvati became very uncomfortable with how seriously Lavender took her relationship with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] in their sixth year. Parvati was often embarrassed by the behaviour of her friend in regards to Ron, though despite this the two remained close. Her reaction to Lavender's death is unknown, although she was likely devastated at the death of her closest friend.




, her ex-boyfriend|alt]]

In [[1996]], during her sixth year, Lavender developed a crush on fellow Gryffindor [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. She took to complimenting him and flirting with him, which Ron seemed surprised and flattered by, though he was interested in [[Hermione Granger]] at the time. However, after Ron became angry with Hermione, he entered into a romantic relationship with Lavender. The romance consisted mostly of snogging, often in public, much to the disgust of Hermione, who was jealous and hurt, and of Ron's younger sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], who considered him a "''filthy hypocrite''" because he insulted her for being caught kissing [[Dean Thomas|her boyfriend]] earlier in the year.



Lavender was very affectionate with, and possessive of, Ron, adopting the name of "Won-Won" for him and sending him a [[Ronald Weasley's sweetheart necklace|necklace]] for [[Christmas]] saying "''My Sweetheart''" on it, which he greatly disliked and was shocked that she would think it was to his taste. The romance began to cool on Ron's end after the [[Christmas holidays]], which Lavender noticed and was very upset by. 

She repeatedly pressed [[Harry Potter]] for details of Ron's feelings for her, and alarmed even her best friend [[Parvati Patil|Parvati]] with how obsessively she threw herself into the relationship. Lavender was infuriated when no one thought to inform her after Ron was poisoned, especially since Ron took to feigning sleep whenever she came to visit him in the infirmary, and reconciled with Hermione. After being released, Ron took to avoiding his girlfriend.


Ron was spared the difficult task of breaking up with Lavender when she ended things with him, convinced that there was something going on between him and Hermione. Afterwards, Ron was clearly content, but Lavender was upset for some time. For example, when Ron brushed fake snow off Hermione's shoulders soon after the break-up, Lavender burst into tears. Ron did show genuine guilt for breaking up with her. It is unknown how Ron reacted when Lavender was killed by [[Fenrir Greyback]], although when he saw her being savaged, Ron was clearly horrified and concerned but Hermione beat him to saving Lavender. Considering this, it is likely Ron at least was saddened by her death.




Lavender and Parvati were not nearly as close to their other room-mate, [[Hermione Granger]], as they were to one another. Though the girls did not appear to dislike each other, they had very different interests and sometimes clashed as a result. For example, Hermione scorned [[Divination]], Lavender and Parvati's favourite subject. She also became irked with Lavender for doubting [[Harry Potter]]'s assertion that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned in [[1995]].

Though Hermione was jealous of Ron and Lavender's relationship, she directed her anger mostly at Ron, perhaps indicating that Lavender was initially unaware of Hermione's feelings for him. Eventually, however, Lavender started to become jealous and suspicious of the time Ron and Hermione spent together, while her boyfriend was increasingly pulled away from her.

Although Hermione was glad when they broke up, she tried to spare Lavender's feelings by not being openly affectionate with Ron. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Hermione spotted Lavender being savaged by [[Fenrir Greyback]], blasting him away immediately, it was too late as Lavender was already dead at the time.




Lavender seemed to have a reasonably close and caring relationship with Divination professor [[Sybill Trelawney]]; she had an unwavering faith in the reliability of Trelawney's predictions and was often seen comforting or supporting her when she was experiencing difficult times. She and Parvati became offended on the professor's behalf when Hermione made her disdain for Trelawney and the subject she taught clear in [[1993]]. When she was temporarily sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]], Lavender and Parvati brought Trelawney some daffodils.

During the Battle of Hogwarts, Trelawney prevented [[Fenrir Greyback]] from savaging Lavender any further after Hermione Granger blasted him away by dropping a crystal ball on his head. However, during the course of the fighting, Lavender succumbed to her wounds.




Lavender became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] during her [[1995–1996 school year|fifth year]]. Dumbledore's Army was an organisation founded by [[Harry Potter]], Ron and Hermione, and led by Harry, in order to teach the students [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], something that professor [[Dolores Umbridge]] did not; thinking that the students would use their magic against the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

Lavender was a friend of fellow members [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Dean Thomas]] and [[Seamus Finnigan]]. Lavender may have been a friend of [[Luna Lovegood]], too, although, when the two girls met each other, Lavender made fun of Luna for her strange earrings.

''[[Wikipedia:Lavender|Lavender]]'' is a type of flower, as well as a name for the pale shade of purple of the blossoms. In flower symbolism, the lavender can symbolise affection, cleansing, or concealment. The Ancient Romans used lavender to scent baths, and its name is derived from the Latin verb ''lavāre'', "to wash". In Western culture, the colour [[Wikipedia:Lavender (color)|lavender]] can sometimes be used to symbolise decadence and the enjoyment of sensuality. Interestingly, "Lavender" is a colour and her last name is "Brown", which is also a colour.

*Lavender Brown was played by [[Kathleen Cauley]] in the second film, and then in a non-speaking role by [[Jennifer Smith]] in . She did not have any lines and was never mentioned by name, but appeared in several scenes. She is played by [[Jessie Cave]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]''.
**Many fans speculate as to why Lavender Brown's actress was changed for , but the reasoning is quite simple. Before ''Half-Blood Prince'', Lavender Brown played no major role, she was portrayed by two separate actresses in the second and third film and was a background character. Background characters have no specific casting, which is why multiple people can portray them. Usually they are given character names just to keep order on a film set. Lavender Brown, as a major character role, was not cast until the sixth film. The filmmakers had no way of knowing she would play such a role when they assigned her name to the background actresses from previous films, which is why her actress changed in the sixth film.
**Casting a white actress in a role that had previously been held by black actresses, however, earned the film-makers some criticism for white-washing the cast. Although, in the book, when she and Ron are cuddling, it is said that "it was impossible to tell whose hands were whose", implying she is the same race as Ron, as otherwise their hands could have been clearly distinguished.
**Jessie Cave recently portrayed Lavender again for one of her Pindippy videos.
*In , Lavender is shown to be in [[Hufflepuff]], instead of [[Gryffindor]]. This error was corrected in subsequent films.
*In the novel , Lavender Brown's fate after Fenrir Greyback's attack is left uncertain: she is last mentioned "feebly stirring" after the attack. The film ''Deathly Hallows: Part 2'' is more clear about her fate, appearing to show her death outright, a fact confirmed in .
** was inconclusive about the matter, originally listing her as "''Presumed dead, 2 May 1998''" though this was removed sometime prior to 25 January 2016.
**While the additional rendition never made it onto the  editorial article where Artist [[Owen Davey]] was commissioned, it is interesting to note that, on the portfolio page for said commission on Davey's official website, Lavender's portrait fades away, being treated the same way as most other confirmed deceased individuals.
*On [[J. K. Rowling]]'s draft class list, Lavender was listed as a [[pure-blood]], and as she was attending Hogwarts [[1997–1998 school year|1997-1998]], she must have been a pure-blood, half-blood, or she faked her blood status, as she would have been taken by the Death Eaters otherwise.
*Lavender was the fifth student to be sorted in [[1991]], and she was the first Gryffindor.
*Lavender is incorrectly referred to as a male in the [[German]] version of .
*Lavender is the only original member of Dumbledore's Army not to at least be mentioned in the  [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game]]. However, when [[Padma and Parvati Patil]] are told to meet in the Room of Requirement, Lavender's name is ticked on the Dumbledore's Army parchment.
*In the  novel, Lavender either did not qualify for or did not select [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level [[Potions (class)|Potions]] as one of her classes. However, in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film adaptation]], she appears to be attending a Potions class.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|first part of the film adaptation]] of , Lavender can be briefly seen on the [[Hogwarts Express]] sitting next to [[Romilda Vane]], [[Leanne]], and [[Cormac McLaggen]].
