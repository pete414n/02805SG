'''Wilkie Twycross''' (b. before [[1979]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and employee of the [[British Ministry of Magic]], who was the [[Apparition Instructor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] to students who were age seventeen or approaching age seventeen and wish to obtain a licence to [[Apparition|Apparate]].

During the [[1990–1991 school year]], Twycross was the supervisor of the [[Ministry of Magic student programme]] for [[Seventh year|seventh-year]] students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Before the students' first assignments, he gave them a lecture on the ''[[Rules of Conduct for Students Visiting the Ministry of Magic]]''. Later, he met [[Jacob's sibling]], a student who arrived late, taught them the rules of conduct and gave them a visitor badge for their credentials.



, 1997]]
During the [[1996–1997 school year]], Twycross would give [[Sixth year|sixth-year]] students [[Apparition (class)|Apparition classes]] in the [[Great Hall]] at Hogwarts. Upon meeting Twycross, [[Harry Potter]] described him as "''oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away''." He wondered whether this was because of the large amount of [[Apparition|Apparating and Disapparating]] he did. 

Many of the sixth year students in Twycross's Apparition class disliked and called him various insults, inspired by the "Three D's of Apparition" that he tried to teach them. The most moderate of these were "[[dog]]-breath" and "[[Faeces|dung]]-head."



*'''[[Apparition]]''': As the [[Apparition Instructor]] for [[sixth year]] Hogwarts students, Twycross would have been highly accomplished in apparition as a form of [[magic]]al transportation. He had a very sophisticated understanding of the art of apparition, teaching his students the specifics needed to apparate successfully and the [[Splinching|dangers]] of it, showing his proficiency in this field.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Twycross was able to [[Hoop conjuring spell|conjure]] wooden hoops during an Apparition lesson in the Great Hall simply with a wave of his [[wand]]. [[Conjuration]] was known to be a particularly difficult branch of transfiguration.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Twycross was able to conjure hoops without saying an [[incantation]], which was very advanced magic.


'''' is a surname used in [[Scotland]] and [[England]] possibly a diminutive of William. '''' is a small village and civil parish in Leicestershire, England. Also ''twy-'' is an archaic form of ''two'' so his surname could literally mean ''two-cross'', or one who crosses between two places; hence, one who Apparates.


*It is most likely that Twycross worked for the [[Department of Magical Transportation]], given his profession as an Apparition Instructor.
*It is interesting to note that Rowling was reading Wilkie Collins' ''The Moonstone'' when she was writing , so it is possible that it is where she got the name.
