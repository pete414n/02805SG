'''Andrew Kirke''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].

==Biography==
Andrew became a [[Beater]] on the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]], along with [[Jack Sloper]], in [[1995]]. They took over the positions after [[Fred and George Weasley]], who were given a lifelong ban from [[Quidditch]] by [[Dolores Umbridge]] (their bans were lifted right after Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts). [[Angelina Johnson]], the team Captain, was unimpressed by Andrew and Jack's performances during try-outs, but considered them to be better than the others who had tried out. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] considered them to be dreadful players, even worse than he was.

During [[Gryffindor]]'s quick defeat to [[Hufflepuff]], Andrew had a pitiful performance; when [[Zacharias Smith]] flew in his direction carrying the Quaffle, Andrew shrieked and fell off his broomstick. [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] caught the [[Golden Snitch]] twenty-two minutes into the match, causing Gryffindor to lose by only ten points. Later, after the match with Ravenclaw, he and his teammates victoriously carried Ron.

==Behind the scenes==
*Andrew Kirke's name is possibly derived from ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' book ''The Magician's Nephew,'' which features a main character named Digory Kirke with a maternal uncle named Andrew Ketterley.
**This is the same namesake of fellow [[Portrait of a Quidditch player|Quidditch player]] [[Cedric Diggory]].
