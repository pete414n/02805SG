'''Miles Bletchley''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the early [[1990s]]. He was a member of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], serving as their [[Keeper]].

==Biography==
===[[1991–1992 school year]]===
Bletchley played in [[Slytherin]]'s match against [[Gryffindor]] this year. He was unable to block [[Gryffindor]]'s only goal attempt during that match, from [[Angelina Johnson]].

===[[1992–1993 school year]]===
Bletchley, along with the rest of the team, received a new [[Nimbus 2001]] this year from [[Lucius Malfoy]] as an incentive to allow his son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] onto the team as [[Seeker]]. He and the rest of the team flaunted these new [[broomstick]]s to the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. He laughed along with the other members of the team at [[Ronald Weasley]] when his [[Charles Weasley's wand|broken wand]] redirected an attempted [[Slug-Vomiting Charm]] back at him.

===[[1995–1996 school year]]===
During this year, Bletchley took part in a small plot by the Slytherin Quidditch team to [[jinx]] various members of the Gryffindor team prior to their first match. He hit [[Alicia Spinnet]] with a jinx that made her eyebrows grow excessively large. Despite doing this in front of fourteen witnesses, [[Severus Snape]], who seemed to support this action, merely chose to assume she had used a poorly applied [[Hair-Thickening Charm]] on herself, and Bletchley was not punished.

Later, during the match itself, Bletchley managed to save at least one attempted goal by Angelina Johnson. He, along with the rest of his team and the Slytherin supporters, sang "[[Weasley is Our King]]" throughout the match in a successful attempt to unnerve Ron Weasley, Gryffindor's new Keeper.

==Personality and traits==
Miles was a mean-spirited individual who lacked good sportsmanship. He took enjoyment in mocking others, and evidently saw no problem with foul play against members of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Miles played as [[Keeper]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] at Hogwarts, meaning he was a fairly accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player.
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Miles [[jinx]]ed [[Alicia Spinnet]] with an unpleasant jinx that caused her eyebrows to grow rapidly, meaning he had some skill with [[Dark charm]]s.

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{PS|FA}}, the Slytherin [[Keeper]] was played by [[Amy Domenica|Amy Puglia]], despite there never having been any girls on the Slytherin squad in the books. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]],'' he instead was played by [[David Churchyard]].
*In the video game {{QWC}}, the Slytherin Keeper is named "[[Kevin Bletchley]]". It is possible this was intended to be Miles.

==Etymology==
"Miles" is from the Germanic name ''Milo'', introduced by the Normans to England in the form ''Miles''. The meaning is not known for certain. It is possibly connected to the Slavic name element ''mil'' meaning "gracious". From an early date it was associated with Latin ''miles'' "soldier".
