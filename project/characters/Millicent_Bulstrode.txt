'''Millicent Bulstrode''' (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]) was a [[half-blood]]<ref name="blood"/> [[Wizardkind|witch]]. She began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] in [[1991]].<ref name="PS7"/> In her [[fifth year]], Millicent became a member of the short-lived [[Inquisitorial Squad]] led by [[Dolores Umbridge]].<ref name="OOTP32"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Millicent Bulstrode was born sometime between [[1 September]] [[1979]] and [[31 August]] [[1980]] into the [[pure-blood]]ed, [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]] [[Bulstrode family]], though was herself a half-blood.<ref name="PM">{{WW|pure-blood}}</ref><ref name="blood"/> She may have been related to [[Violetta Bulstrode|Violetta Black]] {{Comment|née [[Bulstrode family|Bulstrode]]}} wife of [[Cygnus Black II]], and therefore related to the [[Lestrange family|Lestrange]], [[Malfoy family|Malfoy]], and [[Tonks family|Tonks]] families.

===Hogwarts years===
====First year====
{{Quote|“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.|[[Harry Potter]]'s negative perception of Millicent and her fellow Slytherins|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Harry Potter and first years to be sorted.png|250px|thumb|left|Millicent and her classmates during their Sorting]]

Millicent started her education at Hogwarts in [[1991]]. Prior to the school year, she likely purchased her equipment from [[Diagon Alley]], and brought her cat with her on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. During the [[Welcoming Feast]], Millicent was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into the house of [[Slytherin]] whose head at the time was [[Severus Snape]].<ref name="PS7">{{PS|B|7}}</ref> 

She would share a dormitory with the other Slytherin girls, [[Pansy Parkinson]], [[Tracey Davis]], [[Daphne Greengrass]], and another girl.

====Second year====
{{Quote|Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Duelling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she’s gone home for Christmas — so I’ll just have to tell the Slytherins I’ve decided to come back..|Hermione Granger on whose form she will take under Polyjuice Potion|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
In [[1992]] Hogwarts became under threat from the re-opened [[Chamber of Secrets]] and the [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]] it contained inside. As a precaution, students were taught how to duel. Millicent and [[Hermione Granger]] were paired together during the short-lived [[Duelling Club (1990s)|Duelling Club]]. Their duel spiralled into a [[Muggle duelling|physical brawl]], with Millicent holding Hermione in a headlock, in spite of the standard "no contact" rule in [[duelling]]. Hermione's friend, [[Harry Potter]], came to her rescue, breaking the two girls up.<ref name="COS11">{{COS|B|11}}</ref>

[[File:HP2-01487.jpg|250px|thumb|Millicent during a second year [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] class]]

Hermione later used hair from this incident to try to assume Millicent's form with [[Polyjuice Potion]], as the real Millicent went home for [[Christmas]]. However, the hair she obtained turned out to be that of [[Millicent Bulstrode's cat|Millicent's cat]] and partly transformed Hermione into a cat. This resulted in her spending some time in the [[Hospital Wing]] as polyjuice potion wasn't intended to be used for cross-species transformations.<ref name="COS12">{{COS|B|12}}</ref>

====Third and fourth years====
Little is known about Millicent during her [[Third year|third]] and [[Fourth year|fourth]] years.

====Fifth year====
{{Quote|The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger. A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-picked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock points ''[...]'' |[[Draco Malfoy]] regarding the Inquisitorial Squad members and their powers|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[File:InquisitorialSquadDiscovery.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Inquisitorial Squad]], to which Millicent belonged|alt=]]

In [[1996]], Millicent was one of the students of the Slytherin-dominated [[Inquisitorial Squad]] an organisation started by then-headmistress [[Dolores Umbridge]] to silence all opposition to [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] activities at Hogwarts. She was one of the students who caught [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], and [[Luna Lovegood]], who were attempting to use the Floo Network in Umbridge's office to find out if [[Sirius Black]] had been attacked in the [[Department of Mysteries]]. 

Particularly, she helped in holding down Hermione.<ref name="OOTP32">{{OOTP|B|32}}</ref> However, given how the four remaining DA members managed to overpower the Inquisitorial Squad and incapacitated them with various [[Stunning Spell]]s, [[Disarming Charm]]s and a powerful [[Impediment Jinx]] cast by [[Neville Longbottom]],<ref name="OOTP33">{{OOTP|B|33}}</ref> Millicent was most likely herself assaulted and injured with their offensive spells, as the other Squad members were quite badly.

====Sixth year====
In Millicent's sixth year she had lost her former power of being in the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] and could no longer use it to her advantage. Her fellow Slytherin [[Draco Malfoy]] had joined the Death Eaters, which put a strain on his friendships with other Slytherins, possibly including Millicent. Severus Snape, her head of house, had now taken on the position of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher and favoured Slytherins during his lessons. Later on in this year, headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] was killed.

====Seventh year====
[[File:Slytherins battle.jpg|250px|thumb|alt=|Slytherins in the [[Great Hall]] urging the students to hand Harry Potter over to Voldemort]]
Due to her half blood status and [[Slytherin]] relations, Millicent likely was allowed to return to Hogwarts in 1997 when it was under the control of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], with her former head of house [[Severus Snape]] acting as headmaster. 

If she did, Millicent would have been present for the evacuation of Hogwarts preceding the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and it would be assumed that Millicent left the castle along with the other members of the House of Slytherin, rather than choosing to fight Voldemort's army.<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref> It could also be a possibility that Millicent would return to Hogwarts, fighting against the school alongside Death Eaters, as did some other students of Slytherin.

==Physical appearance==
Millicent was black-haired and had a heavy, jutting jaw. She had a large, square build that allowed her to physically intimidate smaller people, and was bigger than [[Harry Potter]] in their second year. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] once remarked that Millicent was "ugly," and Harry thought that she looked like a [[hag]] he had seen pictured in ''[[Holidays with Hags]]''.<ref name="COS11"/> She was also described by Harry as being "no [[pixie]]."<ref name="COS12"/>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode’s robes. Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted.|Millicent's hostile personality|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Given her interactions with others and her membership of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] in her fifth year, Millicent appeared to be a rather mean-spirited and aggressive witch who enjoyed bullying other Hogwarts students, mainly by using her large figure to intimidate and even in some cases assault them, as shown when she physically restrained the smaller Hermione Granger in both 1992 and 1996.<ref name="COS11"/><ref name="OOTP32"/> She also would have used her authority in [[Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge's]] short-lived [[Inquisitorial Squad]] to bully and harass other students, and was therefore probably supportive of Umbridge's reign of cruelty and authoritarianism over Hogwarts.<ref name="OOTP32"/>

==Possessions==
*'''[[Millicent Bulstrode's cat|Cat]]''': Millicent owned a pet [[cat]], which was of [[Black cat|black hair]], an acceptable animal to keep as a pet at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. [[Hermione Granger]] unknowingly extracted some of her cat's [[Cat hair|hair]] in [[1992]] during the [[Duelling Club]], which she mixed in her glass of [[Polyjuice Potion]], believing the hair to be [[Human hair]].<ref name="COS12"/>
*'''[[Wand]]''': As a Hogwarts student, Millicent owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[wand core]], which she presumably purchased sometime before starting her [[first year]] in [[1991]].<ref name="COS11"/><ref name="LEGOY1"/>

==Etymology==
*The name ''Millicent'' is Germanic, meaning "she with the gentle gait". This is ironic, considering that Millicent Bulstrode is not portrayed as gentle or graceful in the least; [[Harry Potter]] once remarked that she's "no [[pixie]]" while they were taking [[Polyjuice Potion]], in relation to the fact that Millicent, Crabbe and Goyle would not fit into a single toilet cubicle.
*Millicent may also come from the Latin words ''mille'', meaning "thousand", and ''centum'', meaning "hundred". It also sounds similar to the word "militant", which matches her aggressive personality.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Millicent Bulstrode-HP 14.png|200px|thumb|Millicent Bulstrode in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
*She was portrayed by [[Helen Stuart]] in {{COS|FA}}; however, her appearance was practically unnoticeable to the point that the only true confirmation of her appearance in the film is the credit of her actress.
*Because her role appears to be such an obscure cameo that even the most sharp-eyed of fans would have trouble picking up on, it is also possible that her actual role was cut and that the presumed cameo of Millicent is simply that of an unnamed student.
*In the books, Millicent's hair is black. In the ''Chamber of Secrets'' film, Millicent is portrayed by a brunette actress.
*Millicent may be related in some way to the [[House of Black]], as there is a mention of a [[Violetta Bulstrode]] in that family tree.<ref>[[House of Black|Black family tree]]</ref>
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{COS}}, there is a Slytherin girl, strongly hinted to be Millicent, who says her own distinct lines, such as finding Professor Snape more attractive than Professor Lockhart. She is also mentioned by other female students as being "a real witch", and she leaves Harry many a snarky remark.
*Before it was revealed that [[Fleamont Potter|Fleamont]] and [[Euphemia Potter]] were [[James Potter I|James]]' parents, it was speculated that [[Charlus Potter]] and his wife, [[Dorea Black]], daughter of [[Violetta Bulstrode]], were his parents and therefore [[Harry Potter]]'s grandparents. Therefore, Millicent was a presumed (somewhat distant) relative of both James and Harry. Her relationship with the [[Potter family]], however, remained the same, though it only meant being related only to Dorea and her [[Charlus Potter's son|son]], a descendant of the [[Bulstrode family]] on his mother's side.
