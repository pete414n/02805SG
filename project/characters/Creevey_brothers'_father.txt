'''Mr Creevey''' was the father of [[Colin Creevey|Colin]] and [[Dennis Creevey]]. A [[Non-magic people|Muggle]], Mr Creevey was employed as a [[milk]]man, and was astonished to learn that his elder son, Colin, was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. Colin sent plenty of photographs home to his father during his [[first year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1992]], a high proportion, presumably, of [[Harry Potter]], who was an object of near-worship for young Colin.
