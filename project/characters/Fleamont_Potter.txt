{{Quote|Henry's son was called Fleamont Potter. Fleamont was so called because it was the dying wish of [[Henry Potter's mother|Henry's mother]] that he perpetuate her maiden name, which would otherwise die out. He bore the burden remarkably well; indeed, he always attributed his dexterity at duelling to the number of times he had to fight people at Hogwarts after they had made fun of his name. |Description of Fleamont and his name|Pottermore}}

'''Fleamont Potter''' (pre-[[1909]] – c.[[1979]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the son of [[Henry Potter]]. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. At some point after graduating Hogwarts he married [[Euphemia Potter]].

Fleamont had only one son later in life, [[James Potter I|James Potter]]. He is the paternal grandfather of the famous [[Harry Potter]], though he did not live long enough to meet him. He is also the great-grandfather of [[James Potter II|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Fleamont was born into the wealthy [[pure-blood]]ed [[Potter family]], to [[Henry Potter]], a prominent [[Wizengamot]] member. He was named after his paternal grandmother's maiden name, as it was her dying wish that he perpetuate her maiden name, which would otherwise die out.

===Hogwarts years===
He started at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] at the age of eleven and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. Due to the teasing he got for his first name, he often got into fights over it, to which he would later attribute his dexterity at [[duelling]]. 

At some point and per the family tradition, he inherited the [[Cloak of Invisibility]] from his father Henry Potter, who was a distant descendant of [[Ignotus Peverell]].

===After Hogwarts===

====Sleekeazy's Hair Potion====
After his graduation, Fleamont developed [[Sleekeazy's Hair Potion]], sales of which quadrupled the family gold. 

Upon retirement, he sold the company that made the potion. He made at a vast profit from selling his company.

====Family====
Fleamont married [[Euphemia Potter]], and although the family prospered, they had difficulty in having children. They eventually gave up the hope of having a son or daughter of their own. However, in [[1959]], to the couple's shock and surprise, Euphemia became pregnant. Since the Potters had James later in their lives, he was their only child, and was pampered and cherished accordingly.

Around [[1976]], Fleamont and Euphemia took in their son's best friend, [[Sirius Black]], who had run away from [[12 Grimmauld Place|home]] at age 16, because his family hated him. They treated Sirius like a second son. Though Sirius stayed in the Potter home for only a year, eventually using money inherited from his uncle, [[Alphard Black]], to buy his own flat, Mr and Mrs Potter always welcomed him over for Sunday dinner thereafter.

===Death===
James later married the [[Muggle-born]] witch, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], in around [[1978]]-[[1979]]. Shortly after their son's wedding, both Fleamont and Euphemia (who were advanced in age) succumbed to [[Dragon Pox]], dying within days of each other. 

However, they had presumably died happy, for they have had the satisfaction of living long enough to see their son settled in life and married to a fine young woman.

====Post-mortem====
With their deaths, James inherited an [[Cloak of Invisibility|invisibility cloak]] that had been passed down through the Potter family for many generations, and the considerable Potter fortune (which enabled him and his wife to lead a comfortable but all too brief life). 

Fleamont's and Euphemia's deaths also meant that they did not meet their grandson, [[Harry Potter|Harry James Potter]], who would be born on [[31 July]], [[1980]], nor did they realise tragedy would befall the Potter family soon thereafter.

Since Harry was, himself, orphaned at a very young age, it soon became his heart's desire to meet his family. When, in [[1991]], he glimpsed into the [[Mirror of Erised]], Harry saw his grandparents, on both his father's and his mother's side, among a number of other relatives he had never met.

==Physical appearance==
When Fleamont's grandson [[Harry Potter|Harry]] looked into the [[Mirror of Erised]] and saw his [[Potter family|family]], he noted several individuals who had "''green eyes like his, other noses like his, ''[and]'' even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees.''"

It is unlikely that he is one of the green eyed people as Harry inherited his eyes from his mother, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], and it seems to be an [[Evans family]] trait. However, he may have been one of the other individuals who shared traits with his descendant. Fleamont Potter did not wear glasses.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Martial magic]]''': Due to the numerous times he had to magically fight people at Hogwarts after they had mocked his name, Fleamont was a skilful [[Duelling|duellist]].
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Fleamont was an accomplished [[potioneer]]. After his graduation from Hogwarts, he invented the [[Sleekeazy's Hair Potion]], in doing so founded a potion-making company.
*'''Entrepreneurship and business acumen''': Fleamont was known to have quadrupled his family's fortune with his potion-making company, and had sold his company upon his retirement for a vast profit. This showcased his skills as an accomplished businessman.

==Behind the scenes==
*It was once presumed that [[Charlus Potter]] and [[Dorea Black]], who appeared on the [[House of Black|Black family tree]], might have been James's parents (since it was known that Charlus and Dorea also had [[Charlus Potter's son|one son]]). However, [[J. K. Rowling]] revealed via {{PM}} that that is not the case. Either way, Fleamont and Charlus were indeed related; how they were, however, remains a mystery.
*Harry's view of his paternal grandparents was the polar opposite of Voldemort's. Whereas Tom Riddle had hatred for both sides of his family, particularly his patrilineal descent, Harry, who lost his father at a young age, was also saddened by never getting the chance to meet his father's parents. The Mirror of Erised showing Harry having a family reunion reflected his love for the ''idea'' of grandparents, and of a caring family in general. As Harry knew nothing about them, whether this feeling of love and respect for Fleamont and Euphemia Potter would have born out had he known them is likely, but debatable.
*Given that his mother is listed as "unknown" in the Potter family tree, it is likely that Fleamont was conceived out of wedlock, although this is not confirmed.
*According to [[Remus Lupin|Lupin]], James was already wearing the [[invisibility cloak]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|school]]. This implies that Fleamont had given it to [[James Potter I|his son]] well before his death.
*Fleamont may have been a member of the [[Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers]], given his remarkable skill as a potioneer and his contributions to the field, the best known being his cosmetic potion sold by his potion-making company under the brand name [[Sleekeazy's Hair Potion|Sleekeazy]], although this is unconfirmed.
