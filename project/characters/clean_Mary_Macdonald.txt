'''Mary Macdonald''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] of unknown [[Blood status|parentage]].


She attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1970s]] with [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] and [[Severus Snape]].

Sometime during her time at school, she was viciously assaulted by [[Mulciber II|Mulciber]], a [[pure-blood]] [[Slytherin]] and a future [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], with [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]]. [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] heard about this incident and thought it proved that Mulciber was "creepy" with an "evil" sense of humour'', ''but Lily's friend [[Severus Snape]] callously described the incident as "a laugh".

Mary later told Lily that Snape was planning to spend the night outside the [[Fat Lady|entrance]] to [[Gryffindor Tower]] to apologise to her after he called her a "[[Mudblood]]".


The name "Mary" is the usual English form of Maria, which was the Latin form of the New Testament Greek names Μαριαμ (Mariam) and Μαρια (Maria) - the spellings are interchangeable - which were from the Hebrew name מִרְיָם (Miryam). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", and "wished for child". However it was most likely originally an Egyptian name, perhaps derived in part from mry ("beloved") or mr ("love").


*It is unknown what [[Mulciber II|Mulciber]] tried to do to Mary or why she was chosen as his target. She might have been a [[Muggle-born]] or a [[blood traitor]], or else she might have been a random target. [[Igor Karkaroff]] claimed during his trial that Mulciber specialised in the [[Imperius Curse]], which could suggest Mary was the victim of something along those lines, but Karkaroff might have meant [[Mulciber I|Mulciber's father]] and not the Marauders' contemporary.
*While it is not directly stated in , Mary was likely a member of [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts houses|house]]. She was able to tell Lily Evans that Severus Snape was waiting outside Gryffindor Tower, which meant that Mary was likely ''inside'' the tower at the time; few students had managed to access another house's common room, and those who did kept it secret.
*Fans have speculated that there may be a connection between Mary Macdonald and [[Mary Cattermole]], a Muggle-born witch who was known only by her married name, after both were introduced in . If they were the same person, Mary Macdonald would have be a Muggle-born and an obvious target for a future Death Eater; however, there is no evidence besides their shared first name and the chance that they shared a [[blood status]].
