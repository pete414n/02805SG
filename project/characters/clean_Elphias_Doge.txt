'''Elphias Doge''' (b. between [[1 September]] [[1880]] and [[31 August]] [[1881]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], a [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] jurist, a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] in both the [[First Wizarding War|First]] and [[Second Wizarding War]]s, and also a close friend of [[Albus Dumbledore]]. 

In the summer of [[1995]], Doge was part of the [[Advance Guard]], in which he met [[Harry Potter]]. After Dumbledore's death in [[June]], [[1997]], Mr Doge wrote him an obituary for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. Later that same summer, he attended the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] and [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] at [[The Burrow]], and managed to [[Apparition|Disapparate]] from there seconds before the [[Attack at the Burrow]] that ensued when [[Death Eaters]] arrived after the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|fall of the Ministry]].




Elphias Doge was born around [[1881]], to the [[pure-blood]] Doge family. Sometime in or prior to [[1892]], Doge contracted [[Dragon Pox]].

On [[1 September]], [[1892]], at age eleven, Elphias Doge started at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. No longer contagious of his [[Dragon Pox]], but still with a "''pock-marked visage and greenish hue''", not many approached Doge. [[Albus Dumbledore]], however, looked past that and befriended him during their first day at Hogwarts. Doge believed that their mutual attraction was due to the fact that they both felt that they were outsiders: he had his greenish skin tone and Dumbledore was primarily known to others as the son of [[Percival Dumbledore]], who scarcely a year previously had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s. Their peers at Hogwarts would often think of Doge as Dumbledore's "''dim-witted but devoted sidekick''".

When Doge and Dumbledore left Hogwarts in [[1899]], they planned to take a [[Grand Tour]] of the world together. However, when they were staying at the [[Leaky Cauldron]] and preparing to leave for [[Greece]], they got news that Dumbledore's mother [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] had died.


Elphias heard from many people that witnessed the [[duel between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald]], the sheer awe and terror of this legendary duel.




During the [[First Wizarding War]] in the [[1970s]], Elphias Doge became a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation led and founded by his friend [[Albus Dumbledore]], in order to oppose [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. During that time, he would usually wear a silly hat. Given his role within the Order, it is more than likely that Doge fought in several battles of the [[First Wizarding War]].


Between the wars, Elphias Doge served the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] as [[Special Advisor to the Wizengamot]]. He was still in this post well into the [[Second Wizarding War]].

After the [[Return of Lord Voldemort|rebirth of Lord Voldemort]] on [[24 June]], [[1995]], [[Albus Dumbledore]] called the "old crowd", of which Doge was part of, back to form the Second [[Order of the Phoenix]] to fight during the course of the [[Second Wizarding War]].

On [[6 August]], [[1995]], Doge joined the Advance Guard that escorted [[Harry Potter]] from [[4 Privet Drive]] to [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. When he saw Harry, he commented on how much he looked like [[James Potter I|his father]], but had [[Lily J. Potter|his mother]]'s eyes. After arriving at [[12 Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], Doge attended the Order meeting.

Albus Dumbledore's death



After Dumbledore's death on [[30 June]], [[1997]], Doge wrote a heartfelt obituary for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. A close friend of Dumbledore's, [[Rita Skeeter]] "pestered" him to talk to her about the late wizard for her project, ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]''. Doge became upset and called her an "''interfering [[trout]]''", which resulted in Skeeter making various remarks questioning Doge's sanity.

Wedding of Bill and Fleur


Elphias Doge attended the wedding of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] on [[1 August]], [[1997]]. He wore a moth-eaten fez and sat alone in a table drinking champagne. Recognising him from two years before that, and having read Dumbledore's obituary, [[Harry Potter]], disguised as a Muggle to look like a Weasley cousin, joined him and the two had a brief conversation about Dumbledore's childhood, before being interrupted by [[Muriel]], who believed every word of [[Rita Skeeter]]'s sensationalist and mostly false biography of Dumbledore. Doge passionately defended Dumbledore and his family, but Muriel repeatedly contradicted him.

While this was happening, the [[Death Eaters]] were staging a [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|coup in London]], killing [[Minister for Magic|Minister]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] and taking over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. In an attempt to siege [[Harry Potter]], the [[Death Eaters]] infiltrated the wedding, in a [[Attack at the Burrow|short but aggressive skirmish]].

It is unknown what happened to Elphias after the attack at the wedding and it is also unknown if he participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].



Doge was described as having a wheezy voice and a "moth-eaten fez" he wore during the [[wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour]].


In his youth, Doge suffered from [[Dragon Pox]], and everybody at Hogwarts avoided him, except [[Albus Dumbledore]]. This made Elphias friendly towards Dumbledore. Doge has appeared as being a very loyal friend. He also disliked unfairness, as he got angry when [[Muriel]] falsely claimed that [[Ariana Dumbledore]] was a [[Squib]] and that her family had imprisoned her. Doge also appeared as being a friend of the most members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], such as [[James Potter II|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]]. [[Rita Skeeter]] heavily implies Doge to be senile or "dim-witted", but this was most likely spiteful slander of his character because of his refusal to help her in her [[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore|biography]] of [[Albus Dumbledore]]; the post he held within the Ministry, that of Special Advisor to the [[Wizengamot]] suggested otherwise, implying that he was a highly intelligent, knowledgeable and wise wizard indeed.


*'''[[Apparition]]''': At the Wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour, he successfully managed to escape via Disapparation when the Death Eaters attacked.
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Elphias was part of the Order's [[Advance Guard]] in [[1995]], escorting Harry Potter to 12 Grimmauld Place by flying on a [[broomstick]], showing him to have been an accomplished flyer.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Elphias was capable of producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]], which is a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability and talent, given the immense difficulty of performing the charm. 



, his good friend]]
Elphias was close friends with [[Albus Dumbledore]], meeting him the first time at Hogwarts. They were both outcasts, as he contracted [[Dragon Pox]] shortly before he began schooling.

Dumbledore, on the other hand, was an outcast because of [[Percival Dumbledore|his Muggle-hating father]]. After graduating from school, they had planned to tour the world. However, when they were packing to go to [[Greece]] at the [[Leaky Cauldron]], Dumbledore got an [[owl]] informing him that his [[Kendra Dumbledore|mother]] had died and that he had to go home instead.

While Elphias was travelling to Greece, Dumbledore had to take care of his siblings. At the time Elphias was ending his travel, Ariana was killed. Elphias learned that she was accidentally killed in a duel between Albus, [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] and [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. No one ever learned who killed her.

In their later life, Dumbledore and Elphias remained close friends. Elphias had a high opinion of Albus; he thought that he could see the good inside all the people, however apparently insignificant or wretched. After Dumbledore's death, Elphias wrote a heartfelt obituary for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. At Bill and Fleur's wedding, Elphias stated to Harry Potter that he "''certainly knew Albus the longest''", if you didn't count his own brother, Aberforth.


Elphias was also close to the [[Dumbledore family]]. Elphias was unable to meet [[Percival Dumbledore|Percival]], Albus's father, as he was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for punishing three Muggles who had scared [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]]. After that, Ariana lost her sanity and could not control her magical abilities. Doge also liked [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]], Albus's mother. He later stated that she was a fine woman.

Kendra was accidentally killed by Ariana. A few months later, Ariana was also accidentally killed in a duel between Albus, [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] and [[Gellert Grindelwald]], when she attempted to help Albus and Aberforth. It never became clear who did kill Ariana. Elphias participated at her funeral, where Albus and Aberforth had an argument.

Elphias thought that Albus was much more popular than Aberforth, and that people never do seem to count Aberforth. Aberforth also thought that Elphias admired Albus very much, and that Elphias "''thought the sun shone out of Albus's every orifice''", although Aberforth does not seem to have such a high opinion of Doge, referring to him as an "old berk".


]]
Elphias seemed to very much like and respect Harry Potter. When he first met Harry, he said that he looked like his father, but he had his mother's eyes; something that everyone told Harry. Elphias was also a member of the [[Advance Guard]], a group of members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] who escorted Harry to [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. 

Elphias met Harry again in [[1997]], at the wedding of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]. They discussed Albus Dumbledore, and Elphias told him that Albus was a very good person, something that helped Harry feel better.


[[Muriel]] was the loud, ill-mannered, opinionated, 107 year-old aunt of Molly Weasley. She enjoyed gossip very much and [[Rita Skeeter]], and thus was incredibly pleased that Skeeter was to be writing a new book, known as ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'', that would slander Dumbledore. Muriel was delighted in revealing the dark parts of Dumbledore's history to Doge, who idolised and admired him and refused to hear anything bad about him. Being close to the Dumbledores, Doge was very emotional about the tragedy of [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], so to hear Muriel so rudely cackling about it made him furious and feebly wheeze about how untrue it was. Muriel brought Doge to the verge of tears as Muriel made him feel wretched and miserable as he heard slanderous lies being told about Albus. While it is true that some of the information in Skeeter's book was true and Doge did skip over the parts that didn't make Dumbledore look very good, Doge still disliked Muriel for horrifying him with the terrible things Skeeter was going to write and the way Muriel took pleasure in hearing them.


, his allies]]
Elphias was a member of both the first and the second Order of the Phoenix. He had a good relationship with the most members, including [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Alastor Moody]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Remus Lupin]], [[Sturgis Podmore]], [[Emmeline Vance]], [[Dedalus Diggle]] and [[Hestia Jones]], who were also members of the [[Advance Guard]]. Moody did not seem to like Elphias' "stupid hat" during the [[First Wizarding War]].


*''Doge'' was the title held by the elected leaders of Italian maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa and Padua from the 7th to 19th century. It shared the same root as the title duke, in the Latin dux and Greek doux, both simply meaning leader.


*Doge is portrayed by [[Peter Cartwright]] in  and [[David Ryall]] in .
*In , his talk with Harry about Dumbledore's childhood during the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour]] is omitted.
*In , when the wedding is interrupted, and before Elphias Disapparates, he says "Nice meeting you, Mr Potter". This causes a mistake in the film since in the fifth film they had already seen each other when Harry was being rescued from the Dursleys. Although, they may not have actually spoken to each other upon Harry's rescue, and therefore did not officially "meet" each other until the seventh film.
