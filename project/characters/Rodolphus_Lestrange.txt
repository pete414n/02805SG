'''Rodolphus Lestrange''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a member of the [[pure-blood]] [[Lestrange family]]. He, along with his brother [[Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]], joined the [[Death Eaters]] and fought in the [[First Wizarding War]]. The [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]] were considered to be among [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s most loyal and trusted servants and were the only ones along with Barty Crouch Jnr who searched for him after his first downfall.

After Voldemort was defeated by Harry Potter when Harry was only a baby, Rodolphus and his wife [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], along with Rabastan and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] participated in the [[Attack on Frank and Alice Longbottom|torture and permanent incapacitation]] of [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]] and was sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. 

About fourteen years later, Rodolphus escaped with a group of other Death Eaters and fought in several battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]], including the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. After Lord Voldemort's final defeat, Rodolphus was imprisoned in Azkaban once more.

In [[2020]], he escaped from Azkaban once again, and set to look for Voldemort and Bellatrix's illegitimate daughter, [[Delphini]], informing her of her destiny and heritage.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rodolphus Lestrange was born to the [[pure-blood]] [[Lestrange family]], in [[Great Britain]], prior to [[1953]].

===Hogwarts years===
When Rodolphus attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], he was sorted into [[Slytherin]] house. He became friends with many other pure-blood students and, according to [[Sirius Black]] joined a [[Gang of Slytherins|group of friends]] that included many future [[Death Eaters]] like; [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Black]], [[Lucius Malfoy]], [[Evan Rosier]], and [[Severus Snape]].

===First Wizarding War===
He and Bellatrix eventually married sometime before 1970 and both took the [[Dark Mark]], fighting in the [[First Wizarding War]]. She married him only to uphold [[House of Black|her family]]'s tradition of marrying respectable [[pure-blood]]s. She was obsessively in love with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. It is unknown how Rodolphus felt about her. However, the two did seem to work together effectively as Death Eaters.

[[File:B4C30M1 Wizengamot trial Pensieve memory.png|250px|thumb|left|The trial of Rodolphus along with his wife Bellatrix, Barty Crouch Jnr and Rabastan by the [[Council of Magical Law]]]]
After Hallowe'en night of [[1981]], when Lord Voldemort was defeated the first time, Rodolphus and his wife refused to accept it. Along with Rodolphus's brother [[Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]] and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], they attacked [[Auror]]s and [[Order of the Phoenix]] members [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]]. 

They tortured the couple with the [[Cruciatus Curse]] to the point of insanity, and were subsequently captured and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] prison for this crime. Upon [[Trial of the Lestranges and Bartemius Crouch Junior|their trial]], the [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]] proudly declared their continuing devotion and awaited their master's return.

===Second Wizarding War===
{{Main|Second Wizarding War}}
In [[1996]], the [[Dementor]]s of Azkaban revolted, and Rodolphus and Bellatrix [[Azkaban escapes#1996|escaped]] prison along with eight other Death Eaters, including his brother Rabastan to rejoin Voldemort, who had regained his powers and was stronger than before thanks to Wormtail and Barty Crouch Jnr.

====Battle of the Department of Mysteries====
{{Quote|We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary...|[[Lucius Malfoy]] gives orders to the group of Death Eaters.|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Death Eaters attacking Department of Mysteries - Pottemore moment.jpg|thumb|250px|Rabastan and fellow Death Eaters standing in the [[Hall of Prophecy]]]]
Rodolphus participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] soon afterwards; he and Bellatrix were paired together, and pursued [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] into the [[Department of Mysteries#Space Chamber|Space Chamber]] along with two other Death Eaters. He was likely one of the Death Eaters who went on to fight the [[Order of the Phoenix]] in the [[Death Chamber]], though his presence isn't noted. In the aftermath, Rodolphus was returned to prison, although his wife eluded capture.

====Battle of the Seven Potters====
By [[1997]], Rodolphus was again at large, and participated in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], pursuing [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], who was disguised as [[Harry Potter]] with [[Polyjuice Potion]], with his wife and other Death Eaters. Tonks injured Rodolphus at some point during the pursuit, and she and Ron escaped.

During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] the [[1998|next year]], Rodolphus lost his [[Bellatrix Lestrange|wife]], who was killed by [[Molly Weasley]]. What happened to Rodolphus remained unknown during the battle but at some point he is imprisoned again for his crimes.

===Post War===
Sometime in between the war's end and [[2020]], Rodolphus escaped from Azkaban for the third time and sought out the daughter of his former master, [[Delphini]]. Rodolphus revealed Delphi's heritage to her and it is currently unknown what has become of him, as he didn't appear to be involved with Delphini's plan to use [[Albus Potter]] to bring back [[Tom Riddle|her father]].

==Physical appearance==
Rodolphus was a tall, thickset man with very dark hair. However, after being in Azkaban, he appeared thin and his looks might have diminished. As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm, which faded to a scar upon Voldemort's death.

==Personality and traits==
Rodolphus was one of Voldemort's most loyal [[Death Eaters]] and therefore can be considered to be sadistic and a [[pure-blood]] supremacist. His crime against the Longbottoms confirms his willingness to use the [[Dark Arts]] to an unspeakable extent. He might not have been concerned at all about being sent to Azkaban as he "stared blankly" throughout the course of his trial, possibly sharing Bellatrix's belief that Voldemort would return and free them. He did not show any resent towards his wife for having an affair with Voldemort, and even went onto notifying their daughter, Delphini, on her heritage and destiny. He didn't talk very often and, unlike his wife, he seemed to be an extremely serious person who barely even smiled.

Rodolphus stood to be a reasonably skilled wizard, as he managed to use the Cruciatus Curse to devastating effects, driving Frank and Alice to insanity. He also managed to escape from Azkaban three times before [[2020]], an unprecedented feat with apparently no outside help in the last case.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Rodolphus was able to cast an effective [[Cruciatus Curse]] (which takes power, nerve, and ability to perform). He participated in driving Frank and Alice Longbottom into insanity.
*'''[[Martial magic]]''': As one of Voldemort's top Death Eaters he likely took part in many battles during both wars against trained [[Auror]]s and [[Order of the Phoenix]] members. He was one of the Death Eaters to capture Frank and Alice Longbottom (both being immensely skilled). He participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] where he fought against the Order members who arrived, though he was defeated and captured following the battle. He also fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] but was defeated and injured by his niece [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. It is unknown if he was present during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] but if he was it is highly likely he was defeated long before his wife.
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': In the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], he duelled his [[Nymphadora Tonks|niece]] during flight in a losing effort.

==Relationships==
===Bellatrix Lestrange===
[[File:Bellatrix Lestrange promo.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|245px|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]], his wife]]
In marrying Bellatrix Black, Rodolphus made a "''respectable [[pure-blood]] marriage''", as was expected of him. There is no indication that their relationship went beyond this. She never expressed any love or concern for him. It was Voldemort to whom she spoke in a romantic manner instead. However, she and Rodolphus did seem to work effectively together as Death Eaters. 

Rodolphus [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]] alongside his wife, [[Rabastan Lestrange|brother]], and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] in [[1981]]. He fought with Bellatrix during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. He was also with her during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], as [[Nymphadora Tonks]] mentioned cursing him and being pursued by Bellatrix. Sirius Black described them as part of the same "gang of Slytherins" at Hogwarts, which also included [[Lucius Malfoy]], [[Evan Rosier]] and [[Severus Snape]].

Bellatrix once told Narcissa that if she had sons, she would "''be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord''".

No children appear beneath Bellatrix and Rodolphus' names on the [[House of Black|Black family tapestry]], indicating that she had no daughters with Rodolphus either. However, Roldolphus did allow Bellatrix to have access to his [[Lestrange Vault|family's vault]] at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] upon marriage, as Bellatrix referred it as "''[my] vault''".

It was later revealed that Bellatrix had a daughter named [[Delphini]] with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. This indicates that Bellatrix didn't have much marital loyalty to Rodolphus at this time. It is entirely possible that Rodolphus approved his wife's relationship with their master, as the Lestranges worshipped Voldemort, furthering that their relationship as a couple is strictly professional.

===[[Delphini|Stepdaughter]]===
Delphi claimed that Rodolphus found her after many years of him being in prison.{{fact}} It is unknown what sort of relationship he had with his wife's daughter.

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Rodolphus|Rodolphus]] is the Latin form of the name 'Rudolf', which is derived from the Germanic name ''Hrodwulf'', meaning "famous wolf". This may allude to prominent Nazi {{w|Rudolf Hess}}, as the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] ideology has similarities to those of Nazism, according to [[J. K. Rowling]]. Removing the l, Rodophus is Greek for 'Rosy-cheeked'.

==Behind the scenes==
*J.K. Rowling has revealed that [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s true love was [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], suggesting that the Lestranges' marriage was not affectionate, at least on the part of Bellatrix, who merely made "a respectable pure-blood marriage", as was expected of her. Rodolphus' feelings are not known.
*In {{HBP}}, someone by the surname "Lestrange" is shown having gone to school with [[Tom Riddle]]. It is unknown if this person is Rodolphus' father or another relative.
*It's unknown if Rodolphus was aware of Voldemort giving [[Helga Hufflepuff's Cup]] to Bellatrix, or if he was aware of its presence in his [[Lestrange Vault|family vault]].
*Rodolphus may have been a [[Seer]], as he told Delphini a Prophecy of the Dark Lord's return.
