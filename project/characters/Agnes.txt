{{Quote|Here you are, Agnes. See, you're not forgotten, are you? And your [[Agnes's son|son]]'s sent an [[owl]] saying he's visiting tonight, so that's nice, isn't it?|[[Healer]] [[Miriam Strout]] to Agnes|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Agnes''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and patient in the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], admitted sometime before [[Christmas]] of [[1995]].<ref name="OOTP23"/>

==Biography==
She had fur all over her head and barked instead of speaking.<ref name="OOTP23"/> It is possible that she remained at St Mungo's for the rest of her life. Her exact ailment was unknown, but it was noted to be a similar effect to consuming [[Polyjuice Potion]] prepared with animal DNA.<ref name="OOTP23">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref>

[[File:Agnes speaking to Penny Haywood HM724.png|thumb|250px|Agnes speaking to Penny Haywood]]
[[Penny Haywood]] spoke to Agnes in the Janus Thickey Ward in the [[1990–1991 school year]] while on work experience at the hospital in her [[seventh year]].<ref name="HM724">{{HM|7|24}}</ref>

In late [[December]] [[1995]], her [[Healer]] [[Miriam Strout]] informed that her [[Agnes's son|son]] would visit her [[Christmas]] night.<ref name="OOTP23"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Given the description on {{PM}} presents what happens if an [[Animagus]] [[Human Transfiguration|transformation]] fails, it seems likely that this is what happened to Agnes, with her attempted Animagus form most likely being a [[dog]].

==Etymology==
Agnes is a female given name, which derives from the Greek word hagnē, meaning "pure", "holy" or "lamb".
