{{Quote|We are honour-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts! Shame on you, Phineas!|Dippet's portrait berating [[Phineas Nigellus Black]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Professor Armando Dippet''' ([[1637]]–[[1992]])<ref name=HPLE-PA /> was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and the predecessor of [[Albus Dumbledore]] in the post. 

Dippet served as [[Headmaster]] in the [[1940s]] into the [[1960s]] (and possibly the very early 70s). It was during his tenure that the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was first opened by [[Tom Riddle]] since its creation by [[Salazar Slytherin]] in around [[First millennium A.D.|A.D. 993]]. Unknowingly, Dippet was indirectly responsible for the end of the attacks by telling [[Tom Riddle|Riddle]] that the school would have to be [[Closure of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|closed]] if said attacks continued. Dippet was also responsible for the expulsion of [[Rubeus Hagrid]] after Riddle framed him with the attacks.

Dippet left office between March [[1965]] and March [[1971]]<ref name="dumbledoretakesover">{{POA|B|18}} Remus Lupin - "I was a very small boy when I received the bite...But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic." {{WW|remus-lupin}} - Lupin was attacked shortly before his fifth birthday (March 1965) and Headmaster Dumbledore comes to visit shortly before his eleventh birthday (March 1971) so Dumbledore succeeded Dippet as headmaster during this time.</ref> and was succeeded by Albus Dumbledore. He was a "nearly bald and a somewhat feeble" man in his elderly years and died in late [[1992]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Armando Dippet was born in [[October]] [[1637]],<ref name="Birth" /> and it is likely that he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. If so, he must have been [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into either [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]] or [[Ravenclaw]], but certainly not [[Slytherin]], in [[1649]].<ref name="DH16">{{DH|B|16}} The portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black, who tenure came sometime before Dippet's, states that he was the last Slytherin Head of Hogwarts before Snape.</ref>

If he went through his magical education at Hogwarts, he would have graduated at the age of eighteen in [[1656]]. What he did after his graduation is unknown, although Armando Dippet seemed to have been held in high regard in his old age, since he was eventually chosen and offered the job of being Headmaster of Hogwarts, although it is unknown whether he ever took up a teaching post prior to this appointment.

===As Headmaster of Hogwarts===
====Early years====
[[File:COS carrying Myrtle's body away.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dippet watching Myrtle's body getting taken out of Hogwarts]]
Professor Dippet became [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early [[20th century|twentieth century]],<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|F}} - Albus Dumbledore's notes</ref> at over 200 years old.<ref name="Birth" /> In his position, it is possible he was responsible for the employment of [[Horace Slughorn]],<ref name="HBP5">{{HBP|B|5}}</ref> [[Herbert Beery]],<ref name="TBB" /> [[Silvanus Kettleburn]]<ref name="TBB" /> and possibly as teachers at Hogwarts. It is also known that he was responsible for hiring [[Minerva McGonagall]], having offered her "''a job in the Transfiguration department, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore''".<ref name="PMmcgonagall">{{WW|professor-mcgonagall}}</ref>

He may have immediately succeeded Phineas Nigellus Black as Headmaster, after his death in [[1925]]. If so, Dippet would have sent students home early in the following year and increased the security of Hogwarts in response to the threat from [[Gellert Grindelwald]].<ref>[[Media:Daily Prophet - 29 Nov 1926.png|The Daily Prophet, 29 November 1926,]] states that "Headmaster calls for emergency meeting with worried parents" and that he sent "students home early" in the same year. Dippet is the only known male headmaster between Black and Dumbledore, although there may be others.</ref>

====Christmas pantomime====
{{Quote|The night's entertainment concluded with a packed hospital wing...|[[Albus Dumbledore]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
During Dippet's tenure as Headmaster, [[Herbert Beery]], then-Herbology master, proposed an adaptation of ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' as a Christmas treat for both staff and students. The show, however, was a fiasco: the students [[Girl who played Amata|playing Amata]] and [[Boy who played Sir Luckless|Sir Luckless]] had been boyfriend and girlfriend until one hour before the show, at which point [[Boy who played Sir Luckless|"Sir Luckless"]] dumped her for [[Girl who played Asha|"Asha"]]. During the play, the [[Engorgement Charm|Engorged]] [[Ashwinder]] portraying the Worm (provided by the reckless Professor [[Silvanus Kettleburn]]) exploded in a shower of hot sparks and dust, filling the [[Great Hall]] with smoke and fragments of the scenery. While the Ashwinder's eggs set fire to the floorboards, [[Girl who played Amata|"Amata"]] and [[Girl who played Asha|"Asha"]] started [[duelling]] fiercely. [[Herbert Beery|Professor Beery]] was caught in the crossfire and his head assumed unusual proportions. While the staff evacuated the [[Great Hall]], the fire raging inside it threatened to engulf the place.<ref name="TBB" />

Of course, there were several people sent to the [[Hospital Wing]] and Professor Dippet had to put Professor Kettleburn in one of his sixty-two periods of [[probation]]. In response to this dramatic fiasco, Professor Dippet imposed a blanket ban on future pantomimes, a tradition that is still followed by the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]' staff and students to this day.<ref name="TBB" />

====Chamber of Secrets openings====
{{Quote|My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy… the death of that poor little girl. You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the — er — source of all this unpleasantness…|Dippet regarding the closing Hogwarts after the Chamber of Secrets is opened|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

Dippet was the [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] when the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was opened by [[Tom Riddle]], during the [[1942]]—[[1943]] school year. Very fond of Riddle, Dippet was unaware of his sinister nature.<ref name="CS13" />

That school year, many students were attacked by [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]]. On [[13 June]] of the same year, a student named [[Myrtle Warren]] was murdered in a [[Moaning Myrtle's Bathroom|bathroom]],<ref name="CS13" /> during one of the Chamber's openings by [[Tom Riddle|Riddle]].<ref name="CS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref> After realising that no one had seen Myrtle for a couple of hours, Professor Dippet asked fellow student [[Olive Hornby]] to go and look for Myrtle.<ref name="GF25">{{GOF|B|25}}</ref>

Myrtle's [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Myrtle Warren's father|father]] and [[Myrtle Warren's mother|mother]] were summoned to the school by Dippet, and the Headmaster faced the possibility of closing the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|school]]. Dippet also rejected Tom's request of staying at school over the summer holidays due to the situation, but would have given him special permission if the school were much safer.<ref name="CS13" /> Not wanting the school to close, or possibly not wanting to return to the orphanage, [[Tom Riddle|Riddle]] stopped attacking students with the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Chamber's Basilisk]] and framed [[Rubeus Hagrid]] for the attacks, in which Dippet then promptly expelled Hagrid. Under [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s request, Hagrid was trained as [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|Gamekeeper]] and was allowed to remain at the school.<ref name="CS17" />

====Exchange visit with Castelobruxo====
During [[1940s]] or [[1950s]], [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] received students and Professor [[Benedita Dourado]] from [[Castelobruxo]], the [[Brazil]]ian [[wizarding school]], during an exchange visit. When Dippet complained of [[Peeves]], the resident [[poltergeist]], Professor Dourado laughed heartily and offered to send him some [[Caipora]] for the [[Forbidden Forest]] "''to show you what trouble really is''". Naturally, Professor Dippet did not take her up on that offer.<ref name="PM-castelobruxo">{{WW|castelobruxo}}</ref>

====Tom Riddle's job application====
{{Quote|Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach... I had advised Armando against the appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty — but I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position of power.|Discussion of Riddle's application as DADA professor|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

When [[Tom Riddle]] returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] after his graduation to apply for the post of [[professor]] of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], after [[Galatea Merrythought]] retired, Dippet denied him the position for being too young, but invited him to reapply in a few years, despite being advised against it by [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name="HBP20">{{HBP|B|20}}</ref>

Dumbledore, at the time, had realised Riddle's true intentions, but did not include them as his reasons for denying him the job, as Professor Dippet was very fond of him and believed that he was completely honest.<ref name="HBP20" />

===Death and post-mortem===
{{Quote|...Rita Skeeter, best-selling author of ''Armando Dippet: Master or Moron''?|Cover of ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]''|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Prof Dippet.jpg|150px|thumb|Dippet's Chocolate Frog Card]]
Professor Dippet's term as headmaster ended between March [[1965]] and March [[1971]].<ref name="dumbledoretakesover" /> His immediate successor in the post was [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Albus Dumbledore]],<ref name="CS13" /> who had been Dippet's [[Transfiguration department (academic department)|Head of Transfiguration]].

The prominence of Dippet's tenure as [[Headmaster]] is highlighted by the fact that he even got a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] made in his effigy, due to his work as chief administrator of Hogwarts.<ref name="POAG"/>

At some point, [[Rita Skeeter]] published her bestselling biography titled ''[[Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?]]'',<ref name="DH13">{{DH|B|13}}</ref> which, given its title and Skeeter's own brand of sensationalist writing (elsewhere described as "''one quarter truth to three quarters rubbish''"),<ref>[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript (30 July, 2007)] at The Leaky Cauldron</ref> it can be reasonably assumed that it contained false defamatory information, or otherwise facts taken out of context.

In the [[1 September]] [[1992]] edition of the ''[[Evening Prophet]]'', he was being suspected of causing an accident only a month before his [[ancient age flying test]] on his 355th birthday. Dippet died in late [[1992]].<ref name="DOD" /> 

After his death,<ref name="DOD" /> the late Headmaster was allowed to leave behind an imprint of himself in the form of a [[portrait]] mounted on the wall of the [[Headmaster's office]] along with other revered Headmasters and Headmistress.<ref name="OP37">{{OOTP|B|37}}</ref> In doing this, he effectively ensured that he in some capacity could continue to posthumously serve the school by sharing his knowledge with his successors in office as a final service to his beloved school.

The portrait he left behind presents him as very dignified and solemn-looking while attired in long, majestic robes of blue and bronze.<ref name="CSf">{{COS|F}}</ref> In [[1995]], he scorned the portrait of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]], who was feigning tiredness in order to avoid going to [[12 Grimmauld Place]] like Dumbledore asked him to. He was devoted to serving whoever was [[Headmaster]].<ref name="OP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>

==Physical description==
Professor Dippet had pale skin, brown eyes and, in his youth, a thick brown beard.<ref name="POAG" />

In his elderly years, he became frail and feeble-looking. He was balding and had only a few wisps of white [[Human hair|hair]] left.<ref name="CS13" />

==Personality and traits==
As made evident by his portrait in the Headmaster's Office, he was apparently a very proud man who for the most part held himself with dignity and solemnity at all but the most trying of times, in which case he would, over time, look very feeble and tired after having to cope with such troubles at his age. 

Very loyal to Hogwarts, Professor Dippet gave a certain impression of holding the school in higher regard than he did even his staff, as he was very distrusting of others, and Professor Albus Dumbledore, his Head of Transfiguration at during the later parts of Professor Dippet's tenure, noted that he was one of the few people that Professor Dippet confided in. He was also a man of tradition, having trained his portrait to scold anyone who showed lack of respect or loyalty to the school, which was shown when it reprimanded the portrait Phineas Nigellus's for attempting to defy a request from Professor Dumbledore, expressing that they were honour-bound to give advice to the current Headmaster or Headmistress, regardless of their personal feelings.

Professor Dippet appeared to a disciplinarian, as corporal punishment was practised at the school during his tenure. Horace Slughorn once joked that Dippet might place him in detention if he found him letting students roam the school after hours at his [[Slug Club]].<ref name="HBPF"/> He also placed Professor [[Silvanus Kettleburn]], whom he always considered to be quite reckless, on no fewer than sixty-two periods of [[probation]] for various incidents.<ref name="TBB"/>

His concern for the well-being of his students was shown once more during the 1942-1943 school year, when he, like all his employees, did everything in his power to apprehend the perpetrator and protect the students after the opening of [[Chamber of Secrets]].<ref name="CS13"/> During that year, it is known that he instructed a student by the name of [[Olive Hornby]] to go look for fellow student [[Myrtle Warren]] the moment he realised that no one had seen her for some time.<ref name="GOF25">{{GOF|B|25}}</ref>

He also seemed to favour status, as he believed a prefect Tom Riddle over a younger Rubeus Hagrid, and even expelling him without putting much effort in investigating the matter when he was accused of opening the Chamber of Secrets. However, as the school at the time was dangerously near to being closed down by the Ministry of Magic after the murder on Myrtle, he was likely to have done so on account of having been under a lot of pressure. Although as Hagrid was allowed to stay at the school after his expulsion, Professor Dippet might have been a wise, well-meaning if somewhat strict administrator under pressure rather than mercilessly expelling one student on the word of another. 

It is known that during his tenure at Hogwarts, Professor Dippet grew rather fond of [[Tom Riddle]] and was perhaps somewhat biased towards him, partly due to sympathising with the boy who had grown up orphaned and friendless and partly due to the young man's charisma. However, this did not blind him from keeping their safety his number one priority, nor did it stop him for keeping up certain standards.<ref name="CS13"/> This is shown when he rejected the request of a recent graduate to become a teacher on the basis of being too young,<ref name="HBP20"/> as well as rejecting [[Tom Riddle]]'s request of staying at school over the summer holidays due to the situation,<ref name="CS13"/> while unaware that Riddle was the one behind the danger Dippet wanted to protect him from. However, being fully aware that Riddle despised the orphanage where he was raised, he did comment that he would have given him special permission if the school was more safer at the time.<ref name="CS13"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': Having been [[Hogwarts Board of Governors|entrusted]] the task of overseeing the training of young witches and wizards at one of the eleven most prestigious schools of the world, Armando Dippet was a very great wizard with wide-reaching knowledge of and much proficiency in many different branches of magic. This was highlighted by the fact that the extent to which a portrait could interact with those that looked at it depended not on the skill of the painter, but rather on the power of the witch or wizard depicted,<ref>{{WW|hogwarts-portraits}}</ref> and how the gallery of [[Headmaster portraits|headteacher portraits]] in the [[Headmaster's Tower]], including that of Professor Dippet, were all so lifelike that the [[Hogwarts Board of Governors]] found it prudent to remind new appointees to the post.<ref>{{CC}}</ref>
*'''Leadership skills''': While he never achieved the level of admiration and reverence of his immediate successor, Professor Dippet was nonetheless a very capable Headmaster of the school, and remembered as such by his tenure having been the theme of his [[Chocolate Frog Card]].

==Possessions==
*'''Wand''': Professor Dippet's wand was of unknown manufacturer, length, core and wood. He was in possession of it during the [[1940s]]. He left it on his desk during his meeting with [[Tom Riddle]] in [[1943]] concerning the summer holidays and the [[Chamber of Secrets]] openings.<ref name="CSgbc">{{COS|G}} - GBC version</ref>
*'''Headmaster's office''': When Professor Dippet presided in the [[headmaster's office|office]] in the [[Headmaster's Tower]], there was a single bookcase, a desk, and several paintings there, including the [[portrait]]s of his [[headmaster|predecessors]]. His passwords are unknown, though it can be presumed that he told one of them to [[Tom Riddle]] in [[1943]].<ref name="CS13" />
*'''Strawberry and ling plantations''': According to [[Albus Dumbledore]], Professor Dippet planted some [[strawberry|strawberries]] and [[Wikipedia:Calluna|ling]] in the castle grounds while he was Headmaster. However, it is likely that Albus was simply trying to distract [[Cornelius Fudge]] and [[Walden Macnair]].<ref name="PAf">{{POA|F}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Tom Riddle===
{{Quote|I had advised Armando against the appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty...|Dippet's fondness of Riddle|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}Dippet was very fond of [[Tom Riddle]], whom he made several "special arrangements" for. His relationship with him was strong enough to make Dumbledore decide not to tell Dippet about why he thought Riddle should not be given a job at the school.<ref name="HBP20" />

===Hogwarts staff===
Professor Dippet was, apparently, distrusting of his employees, confiding only in a few [[professor]]s, which included the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] teacher [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name="HBP20" />

As headmaster, Dippet placed [[Silvanus Kettleburn]] on at least one, but presumably many more, of his sixty-two periods of probation. The one known time was after he provided an [[Ashwinder]] with an [[Engorgement Charm]] on it instead of a worm for the ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' pantomime. Dippet, after the chaos, placed a permanent ban on pantomimes from there on.<ref name="TBB" />

Another of Dippet's employees was [[Herbert Beery]], who was the one who adapted ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' into a play. Beery, who had been teaching [[Herbology]], eventually left to become a [[professor]] of the [[Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts]].<ref name="TBB" />

[[Horace Slughorn]] also worked under Headmaster Dippet. One evening, during one of his [[Slug Club]]'s supper parties, Slughorn joked that if the student group would be found up and about after hours, Professor Dippet would put them all in detention, including himself.<ref name="HBPF">{{HBP|F}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*"''Armando''" is the Spanish and Italian variant of the name Armand, meaning "of the army". It is likely that, given his name, Armando Dippet is at least partially of Spanish or Italian heritage.
*"''Dippet''" is not a word in English, but "dip" has many meanings, including: to put something into something else, often a liquid; to take something out of something, as in dipping out [[water]]; to lower and raise something; a fool.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Alfred Burke]] appeared as Dippet in {{COS|FA}}, in the memory scene. His face can be glimpsed only for a fleeting moment, before he turns around and convenes with several other wizards. He is also not bald contrary to the book's description.
[[File:Flying Ford Anglia Mystifies Muggles.png|250px|thumb|right|The newspaper mentioning Dippet]]
*In {{COS|FA}}, Armando Dippet is mentioned in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' article ''[[Daily_Prophet_articles#FLYING_FORD_ANGLIA_MYSTIFIES_MUGGLES_.28Evening_Prophet.3B_1_September_1992.29|FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES]]''. In the article, witches [[Leonora Gore]] and [[Daphne Mauboisan]] accuse Dippet, their neighbour, of causing the incident and not a flying car. Dippet is referred to as "''a rather feeble old wizard''", "''well known for his erratic flying''", and had [[Armando Dippet's broomstick|his broomstick]] confiscated pending an [[ancient age flying test]] (a past occurrence, comprising a broomstick crash against [[Felicitania Tugwood]], who fell off of her broom and into the [[River Mersey]], is also cited). However, this canonicity of this article is open to dispute as the article changes subjects part-way through and becomes gibberish.
**If it is Headmaster Dippet mentioned in the article, he was the [[List of oldest wizards|fourth-oldest known wizard]], being born in 1637. The only known wizards older than him were [[Barry Winkle|Barry Wee Willie Winkle]] (b. [[1236]]) and [[Nicolas Flamel|Nicolas]] and [[Perenelle Flamel]] (b. [[1327]] and [[1334]], respectively).<ref name="Birth" />
**His wand may have been made out of pine wood, considering how pine wands tended to choose witches and wizards destined for long lives.
*Armando Dippet shares his first and last initials with [[Albus Dumbledore]].
*The portrait of Armando Dippet is currently displayed among the other headmasters of Hogwarts in [[Headmaster's Office|Dumbledore's Office]] at the {{MHP}} Tour near London. It can be found on the left hand side as you enter the office, just above the [[sword of Gryffindor]].
