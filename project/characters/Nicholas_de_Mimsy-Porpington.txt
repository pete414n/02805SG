{{Quote|I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years. I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.|Sir Nicholas greeting [[Gryffindor]] [[first year|first-year]]s|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
'''Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington''', known after his [[death]] as '''Nearly Headless Nick''', (d. [[31 October]], [[1492]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. 

He was a wizard of the royal court as an adult. He was executed by an improper decapitation, after he had a [[magic]]al mishap with [[Lady Grieve]]. He tried to [[Teeth-straightening spell|straighten her teeth]] but it backfired and she grew tusks. Since then, he became the resident [[ghost]] of [[Gryffindor Tower]] at the [[Hogwarts Castle]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never been guilty of cowardice in my life! The noble blood that runs in my veins —|Sir Nicholas relays some information on his past|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}
[[File:Nearly-Headless Nick.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Sir Nicholas during his lifetime]]
Little is known about Sir Nicholas's childhood. He lived in the [[15th century|fifteenth century]] and was born into the noble Mimsy-Porpington family somewhere in the British Isles.

When he turned eleven, Nicholas attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]].

In his adulthood, Sir Nicholas openly associated with [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s. He was knighted and was a courtier at [[Henry VII|King Henry VII]]'s royal court.

===Execution===
{{Quote|It was a mistake any wizard could make / Who was tired and caught on the hop / One piffling error, and then, to my terror, / I found myself facing the chop.|[[The Ballad of Nearly Headless Nick|A self-penned ballad]] relaying Sir Nicholas's death|J. K. Rowling's official site}}
[[File:BeheadingReenactment.png|250px|thumb|A re-enactment of Sir Nicholas's beheading, as performed at the Hogwarts [[Hallowe'en feast]]]]
Sir Nicholas met Lady Grieve while strolling in the park on the evening of [[30 October]], [[1492]]. He was certain he could straighten her crooked teeth, but his attempt to do so backfired, causing her to grow a tusk.

Sir Nicholas was immediately taken into custody and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] as a result of this mistake. Before being locked in a dungeon, his [[wand]] was taken from him, thus preventing him from using [[magic]] to escape. Throughout the night he cried that he would soon undo the damage done to [[Lady Grieve]].

A priest came to Sir Nicholas's cell to comfort him and escort him to the execution site at dawn the following day. He became a "gibbering wreck" when the executioner told him to kneel before the block. However, the executioner's [[axe]] was blunt, as the grindstone used to sharpen it had been misplaced. Thus, it took forty-five hacks to kill Sir Nicholas and even then his head was only partially severed. Naturally, these acts of betrayal and idiocy alone were not enough to condemn Sir Nicholas to such a brutal death, but the rampant acts of previous juvenile encounters led to an unsympathetic public.

[[Albus Dumbledore]] explained in his notes on "[[The Wizard and the Hopping Pot]]" that Muggle executions of wizards such as Sir Nicholas were rarely successful, given that wizards could magically protect themselves and escape. Sir Nicholas had his wand taken away, however, thus was unable to leave his dungeon cell.

===Post-mortem===
{{Quote|I was afraid of death. I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have... well, that is neither here nor there... in fact, I am neither here nor there... I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead.|Sir Nicholas explaining how he chose to remain among the living|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Nearly headless nick.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sir Nicholas after his death]]
Sir Nicholas chose to linger as a [[ghost]] rather than "go on", because, by his own admission, he feared [[death]]. He became the resident ghost of [[Gryffindor Tower]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and would spend his life after death there. 

"Nearly Headless Nick", as he was called by the majority of the student body, was always happy to point new [[Gryffindor]]s in the right direction when late to class.

====1985–1986 school year====
Sir Nicholas held a [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's four-hundred and ninety-third Deathday Party|Deathday Party]] on [[31 October]], [[1985]].

He was preparing for the party when [[Erling the Great]] arrived at Hogwarts. Since they shared the same deathday, [[Jacob's sibling]] and the [[Fat Friar]] suggested the two celebrate together, but it got rejected by Erling.

This collision gradually escalated to a strife in which Sir Nicholas attempted to sabotage Erling's party by preserving the food which was intended to be spoiled. This act, planned and committed by Sir Nicholas, Jacob's sibling and [[Merula Snyde]], was discovered by [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]], who later ordered Sir Nicholas to give his food to Erling and help with [[Herbology]] classes. However, upon seeing Erling's pompous attitude, he decided to carry on throwing his party despite the lack of food.

Halfway through his party in the [[Deathday Ballroom]], the Fat Friar brought him to see Erling in the [[courtyard]]. Seeing as neither of their parties were going well, with Sir Nicholas's no food and Erling's requirements not fulfilled, the Fat Friar suggested once again that the two hold a party together. Sir Nicholas eventually agreed and cleared out space in the ballroom to allow Erling and his guests to join the party.

====1986–1987 school year====
{{Quote|Did someone say ghosts? Sir Nicholas de-Mimsy Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.|Sir Nicholas to [[Angelica Cole]] and [[Jacob's sibling]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
[[File:Sir Nicholas removing his head HM.png|thumb|250px|right|Sir Nicholas partially removing his head in the Potions Classroom]]
During the [[1986–1987 school year]], Sir Nicholas helped Jacob's sibling find the [[Folio of Fortinbras]], a book which belonged to an old [[Charms Master]] called [[Fortinbras]], in order to learn more about the [[Cursed Vaults]]. After they found and read the book in the [[Charms Classroom]] after searching there, they then searched the [[Artefact Room]], where they found a scroll detailing the [[Beaker of Bartholomew]], a bottle belonging to an [[Potions Master]] called [[Bartholomew]]. They went to look in the [[Potions Classroom]], where he partially removed his head for them after they inquired about his name, much to their disgust. After finding the beaker and reading its inscription, he defended Jacob's sibling against [[Argus Filch]] who had found them there and threatened to report them, calling him a low-class bully and telling him he was supervising them. Afterwards, they searched the student's common room to find a house sigil which contained more information. After finding one, Sir Nicholas reported to them in the Great Hall he had deciphered the meaning of the sigil, he told that the message read that while Hogwarts was supposed to be safe, it kept dangerous things, thus making it more unsafe. After helping them, he told them he would happily help them again if needed, and went to stop Peeves hurling Snape's [[soup]] bowl.

====1988–1989 school year====
[[File:Nearly Headless Nick in History of Magic HM519.png|thumb|250px|right|Sir Nicholas teaching History of Magic with Professor Binns]]
During the [[1988–1989 school year]], Sir Nicholas met with Jacob's sibling on the [[Grand Staircase]] to discuss how [[Beatrice Haywood]] had got trapped in a [[portrait]] with the [[portrait curse]]. He mentioned to them that he had heard a rumour years ago that a student had been stuck in a painting in the [[Lower Chambers Portrait Corridor]], but when he had gone see the student, they had already been freed, if had ever been stuck. After mentioning a faceless interloper who had been tampering with portraits, he told them to seek Professor Binns, given he was not asleep.

Later during the school year, Jacob's sibling met Sir Nicholas in their [[Jacob's room|brother's room]], with [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] and [[Percy Weasley]], along with his pet [[rat]] [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]], where he remarked how the Fat Friar had told him about their intention to locate the [[Marauder's Map]], which reminded him about how their brother believed a [[dragon]] could be within the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]], which only the map could reveal. He believed the map could be within the dark and dirty room as Jacob had once been in possession of. After they searched the room with the help of Jacob's sibling [[Wand-Lighting Charm]], they found a hand-written letter from Jacob to a student called [[Olivia Green]], whom Nick remembered for possessing exceptional bravery for a [[Ravenclaw]], and told them to seek the [[Helena Ravenclaw|Grey Lady]] for answers.

Also during this school year, he helped [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]], a fellow ghost, teach [[Fifth year|fifth-year]] [[History of Magic]] students about [[Witch-hunt|Witch hunts]] of the [[14th century]], using his knowledge of his own [[Capital punishment|execution]] on the subject.

Jacob's sibling later spoke to him in the [[Gryffindor Common Room]] to ask if he had Peeves about, as they wanted the [[Vault portrait]] from him. He gave them advice and told them to seek the Grey Lady.

====1989–1990 school year====
During this school year, he again helped Professor Binns teach History of Magic classes, this year helping Binns teach [[Sixth year|sixth-year]]s about [[Rune|ancient runes]].

====1991–1992 school year====
{{Quote|So — new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row!

[[File:Nick at feast.jpg|250px|thumb|Sir Nicholas surprising first-year Gryffindor students at the [[Welcoming Feast]]]]
On [[1 September]], [[1991]], Sir Nicholas, the [[Fat Friar]] and the other ghosts had an argument on whether [[Peeves]] should be allowed to attend the Start-of-Term Feast or not. Sir Nicholas was of the opinion that the [[poltergeist]] gave the ghosts a bad name with his misdoings, while the Friar wanted to "forgive and forget". During this discussion, the ghosts passed through the [[Chamber of Reception]], in which the first years were waiting for the start of the [[Sorting ceremony]]. Sir Nicholas was surprised to see the newcomers.

At the feast, Sir Nicholas sat opposite Harry Potter and patted his arm when the latter was Sorted into [[Gryffindor]]. He later introduced himself and showed the result of his botched beheading: his nearly chopped neck, when [[Seamus Finnigan]] wondered how could someone be ''Nearly'' Headless.

Later in the year, Sir Nicholas told the Grey Lady how Harry Potter was made [[Seeker]] of Gryffindor.

====1992–1993 school year====
{{Quote|Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.|Nick bitter at his rejection by the Headless Hunt|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:NickGryffindorTable.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Nick at the Start-of-Term Feast talking among the Gryffindors]]
In [[1992]], Sir Nicholas tried to join for the [[Headless Hunt]], although his application was denied by [[Patrick Delaney-Podmore|Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore]], who only accepted huntsmen "''whose heads have parted company with their bodies''". Nick was embittered that "half an inch of skin and sinew" connecting his head and neck was not good enough to qualify as "beheaded".

After Harry Potter returned to the Castle after a rainy [[Quidditch]] practice on [[24 October]], [[1992]], [[Argus Filch]] took him to his office in order to fill in a write-up in which Filch accused Harry of "''befouling the castle''" with mud. Sir Nicholas convinced [[Peeves]] to smash the school's [[Vanishing Cabinet]] over the office as a distraction. 

Nicholas later invited Harry Potter to his upcoming [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|Deathday Party]], in order to try and convince Sir Patrick to let him join the Headless Hunt.

[[File:Deathday Party Pottermore.png|250px|thumb|[[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party]]]]
In the evening of [[31 October]], Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] went to Sir Nicholas's Deathday Party. Sir Nicholas greeted the attendees at the entrance of the dungeon in which the party was held. The trio did not find this party fun in the least and were eager to leave. The trio was also disgusted by the rotten and mouldy food that was present. The Headless Hunt arrived at the party at the time for Sir Nicholas speech and became the centre of attention, as they began a match of [[Head Hockey]] leaving the embittered host ignored. 

Also Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore, the leader of the Headless Hunt managed to offend Sir Nicholas by pointing out that he was not properly decapitated, but the other guests found him quite amusing. This left Sir Nicholas humiliated and embarrassed for the remainder of his party. It is unknown what happened after the trio left, but it can be assumed that the party did not get any better for Sir Nicholas.

Later that same evening, a message was left on one of the Castle's walls, announcing the opening of the [[Chamber of Secrets]] and [[Mrs Norris]], Argus Filch's [[cat]], was found [[Petrification|petrified]].

[[File:Nick petrified.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]] stumbles upon a Petrified Sir Nicholas]]
Later in the year, on [[18 December]], [[1992]] Sir Nicholas was petrified on one of the Castle's corridors, along with [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]]. Sir Nicholas inadvertently saved Justin's life by taking the brunt of the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk's]] otherwise-lethal gaze, with Justin seeing the basilisk through Nick rather than being directly exposed to its vision. Nick received the full blast of its power, but as a ghost it was naturally impossible for him to die again. 

Justin was then carried up to the hospital wing by [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] and [[Aurora Sinistra|Professor Sinistra]], but nobody seemed to know what to do for Sir Nicholas. This could have been the first time that a ghost was petrified, as [[Petrification]] does not seem to be something that happens often, seeing as it is incredibly advanced [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]]. In the end, Professor McGonagall [[Fan-conjuring spell|conjured a large fan]] and gave it to [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] with instructions to waft the ghost up the stairs, most likely towards the hospital wing.

[[File:Harry-potter2-nick_hermione.jpg|250px|thumb|Nick greeting [[Hermione Granger]] after she was unpetrified]]
By the end of the year, [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]]'s [[Mandrake]]s had fully matured and were used to make a [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]] which was administered to revive all those who had been Petrified, including Sir Nicholas. The method by which the draught was administered to Sir Nicholas is unknown. 

He was later seen in the Great Hall at the End-of-Term Fest greeting Hermione after she was revived. He was not present in the Great Hall when Hagrid returned to the school after his stint in Azkaban.

====1993–1994 school year====
{{Quote|The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading.|Sir Nicholas's reenactment at the Hallowe'en feast|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
During the [[Hallowe'en Feast|Hallowe'en feast]] on [[31 October]], [[1993]], the school ghosts provided the entertainment, as they did a bit of formation gliding. On his five-hundred and first Deathday, Sir Nicholas hosted a reenactment of his own beheading, which was deemed a success.

====1994–1995 school year====
{{Quote|You're lucky there's a feast at all tonight, you know. There was trouble in the kitchens earlier... Peeves, of course. The usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the feast — well, it's quite out of the question, you know what he's like, utterly uncivilised, can't see a plate of food without throwing it.|Sir Nicholas tellingthe [[trio]] about the ghost council and [[Peeves]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Nick and Grey Lady.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sir Nicholas speaking with the [[Helena Ravenclaw|Grey Lady]]]]
In the afternoon of [[1 September]], [[1994]] the Hogwarts ghosts gathered to decide whether Peeves should be allowed to attend the [[Start-of-Term Feast]]. The [[Fat Friar]] wanted to give him another chance, but both Sir Nicholas and the [[Bloody Baron]] decided against it.

As a result, Peeves wreaked havoc in the [[Hogwarts kitchens|kitchens]], spilling soup all over the place and scattering pots and pans everywhere. At the Start-of-Term Feast, Sir Nicholas let this incident slip at the [[Gryffindor]] table, shocking [[Hermione Granger]] that "slave labour" made their dinner.

[[File:Nick in Great Hall.jpg|250px|thumb|Sir Nicholas talking with Ron Weasley and Harry Potter]]
By [[1995]], there was a [[Portrait|tetraptych]] of Sir Nicholas hung in the [[Suspension Bridge entrance]].

At the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] in [[1995]], Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Neville Longbottom]] found seats together about halfway down the table, between Sir Nicholas and [[Parvati Patil]] and [[Lavender Brown]]. 

As the [[Sorting Hat]] sung a song warning students to stand together, Sir Nicholas told them that the Hat gave warnings at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school and that peaceful cooperation between the Houses is the key. Ron ended up saying Sir Nicholas was terrified of the [[Bloody Baron]], annoying the ghost.

A week later on [[7 September]], Sir Nicholas looked for the Bloody Baron to see if he could dissuade [[Peeves]] from dropping a bust of [[Phillipus von Hohenheim|Paracelsus]] on top of anyone who passed the corridor in which the bust stood.

[[File:Nick EntranceHall.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Nick greeting students in the entrance hall]]
On [[20 November]], [[1995]], Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, while on their way to visit [[Rubeus Hagrid]] after his return, crossed paths with Sir Nicholas, who was gliding along absent-mindedly humming something that sounded like ''[[Weasley is Our King]]''.

After [[Sirius Black]], Harry Potter's godfather, was murdered at the hands of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] on [[18 June]], [[1996]], Harry asked Sir Nicholas if he could return as a ghost. Sir Nicholas explained to him that only a wizard afraid of death might choose to become a ghost and that a person like Sirius would not do something like that. Nicholas apologised that he could not be of more help to Harry and departed for the [[End-of-Term Feast]].

====1996–1997 school year====
{{Quote|There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts. I am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. '[[Harry Potter]] knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,' I told them. 'I would rather die than betray his trust'.|Sir Nicholas's loyalty to Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Nick1996.jpg|250px|thumb|Sir Nicholas, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley in 1996]]
With the rumours of Harry Potter's status as the 'Chosen One' following the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Sir Nicholas noted during the [[Start-of-Term Feast]], on [[1 September]], [[1996]], that his friendship with Harry had increased his own reputation among the other ghosts as a possible source of information. However, Nicholas openly stated his loyalty to Harry and his refusal to pester him for information.

On the early hours of [[22 April]], [[1997]], the [[Bloody Baron]] saw [[Albus Dumbledore]] return to the Castle from one of his missions to find [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es and reported it to Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. Sir Nicholas later told this to Harry Potter.

Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, was killed at the hands of [[Severus Snape]] in the former's plan on [[30 June]], [[1997]]. The Hogwarts ghosts were known attendees of his [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] in early July; this likely included Sir Nicholas.

====1997–1998 school year====
{{Dialogue|Harry Potter|Nick, you've got to help me. Who's the ghost of [[Ravenclaw Tower]]?|Sir Nicholas|The Grey Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require —?|Sir Nicholas helping Harry find the Grey Lady moments prior to the battle|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
On [[1 August]], [[1997]] the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was taken over by Lord Voldemort's [[Death Eaters]]. By [[1 September]], [[1997]], [[Severus Snape]] was made headmaster of Hogwarts while his fellow Death Eaters, [[Alecto Carrow]] and [[Amycus Carrow]] became the [[Muggle Studies]] and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teachers respectively.

The Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, which were violent. It is likely that Sir Nicholas, as did the [[Head of House|Heads of House]], tried to protect the pupils from Alecto and Amycus.

[[File:Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|left|Sir Nicholas watching as [[Harry Potter]] defeated Voldemort for the final time]]
On [[2 May]], [[1998]], the Battle of Hogwarts ensued after [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] learned Harry Potter was in the premises. The ghosts, including Sir Nicholas, attended a gathering in the Great Hall, in which [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] gave instructions on evacuation of underage students and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] organised the participants for battle. Harry Potter, needing information on the whereabouts of [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem]], asked Nick who the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower was. Although he was initially slightly hurt that Harry needed another ghost rather than him, he pointed her to him. Later on, the ghosts gathered at the Great Hall, joining the mass mourning over the fallen.

When the [[Second Wizarding War]] came to an end, it is highly likely that the ghosts (including Sir Nicholas) celebrated Harry's victory and Voldemort's demise.

==Physical appearance==
[[File:PM Hogwarts ghost Nearly Headless Nick.gif|150px|thumb|Sir Nicholas showing his partially severed neck]]
{{Quote|Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-festive, and insuring that his head didn't wobble too much on his partially severed neck.|Description|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

As a ghost, Sir Nicholas was pearly-white and slightly transparent. He would usually sport a ruff, which would ensure his partially severed head stayed in place, as well as tights, a pair of breeches, a doublet or, occasionally, a tunic. He had a preference for extravagant plumed hats. He also sported long curly hair, and a small moustache and goatee. He carried himself in a prim fashion and spoke in an airy, delicate tone.

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b-c-b|Ronald Weasley|I know who you are! My brothers told me about you — you're Nearly Headless Nick!|Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|I would ''prefer'' you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —|Hermione Granger| ''Nearly'' Headless? How can you be ''nearly'' headless?|Like ''this''.|Sir Nicholas showing the [[Gryffindor]] [[first year|first-year]]s his poorly chopped neck|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Sir Nicholas was affable, kind, and always willing to lend a hand to [[Harry Potter]] and other fellow [[Gryffindor]]s whenever they needed it. Nicholas apparently enjoyed eating during his lifetime, as after his death he spent the feasts at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] looking wistfully at the food. Sir Nicholas was polite and delicate, staying away from potentially indiscreet questions and sensible about the fact that he was no longer living.

Nicholas showed interest in the lives of the students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and took delight in showing off his wound to the dismay of those around him. He was very proud of his bravery and noble heritage, getting easily offended if anyone referred to him as a coward. He was very sociable, being friends with the [[Helena Ravenclaw|Grey Lady]], [[Harry Potter]], and a number of other ghosts who attended his [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|five-hundredth Deathday Party]]. He also had a cordial relationship with the [[Bloody Baron]] and [[Patrick Delaney-Podmore|Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore]]. He did not enjoy being known as Nearly Headless Nick, he preferred to be addressed by his full name or Sir Nicholas.

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|Unless you want your head mostly lopped off by an executioner, don't attempt to perform [[magic]]al orthodontics.|Sir Nicholas to Jacob's sibling|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Nick had some skill with charms, although his skills were evidently problematic and in serious need of improvement, considering that when he attempted to straighten [[Lady Grieve]]'s crooked teeth with a [[Teeth-straightening spell|charm]], he made her grow tusks instead.
*'''[[Study of Ancient Runes]]''': Nick was capable of reading and understanding ancient [[rune]]s, probably due to his several hundred years of existence. He was thus able to teach his knowledge to help Hogwarts students understand and translate such ancient runes.
*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Considering his execution, Nick had enough knowledge of [[Witch-hunt]]s of the [[14th century]] to help [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]] teach [[Fifth year|fifth-year]] students about the subject in [[History of Magic]] classes at Hogwarts.

==Etymology==
''Nicholas'' is from the Greek Nikolaos, "victory of the people." Nick is a jokey, ironic nickname and pun -- one definition of nick is "to cut slightly," and he received more than just a little cut when he was beheaded. ''Sir'' indicates he was knighted by a British monarch when he was alive. ''Porpington'' is a name Rowling made up and is closest to porpentine, an obsolete name for a porcupine. "Like quills upon the fretful porpentine...": From Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]''. Nick can be a prickly-tempered person at times. ''Mimsy'' may have come from the same word coined by Alice in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll. It appears in his nonsense poem "The Jabberwocky": "All mimsy were the borogoves..."

*In the film adaptations of {{PS}} and {{COS}}, Nearly Headless Nick is played by [[John Cleese]].
*In the film adaption of {{PS}}, [[Hermione Granger]], rather than [[Seamus Finnigan]], is the one to ask how he can be "Nearly Headless"
*In the Welsh translation, Nicholas is called "Syr Goronwy ap Gwallter", which literally translated as "Sir Goronwy son of Gwallter", commonly Anglicised as "Walter".
*In {{PS}}, Nick says he had not eaten in nearly 400 years; however, he had, at the time, already been dead for nearly 500 years. In later editions this was changed to "in nearly five hundred years".
*It should be noted that Sir Nicholas's clothes do not match the time period he's said to be from. The ruff, doublet and breeches did not come into fashion until the sixteenth century and are mostly associated with the reign of Elizabeth I. This would be more consistent with earlier versions of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' in which Sir Nicholas claims to have been dead for four hundred years.
*The [[Dating conventions|Harry Potter time-line]] is originally based upon Nick's death-day party in {{COS}}. With him having died in [[1492]] and celebrating his 500th death day, this ostensibly places the novels in the early to mid 1990s. The timeline was later reinforced in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]'' on [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]]'s graves.
*In the first draft of {{COS}}, Nick sang a [[The Ballad of Nearly Headless Nick|self-penned ballad]] explaining how his head had (nearly) come off. There was a [[Priest who comforted Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|priest]] who comforted him.
*While most of the Hogwarts students call him "Nearly Headless Nick", he prefers the more formal "Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington" or "Sir Nicholas". [[Harry Potter|Harry]], however, also calls him Nick. The fact that he prefers to be called Sir Nicholas is only mentioned in the first book and film.
*It is unknown as to how he recovered from petrification by the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]], since he is unable to drink [[potion]]s.
*In the PS1 versions of the first two video games, he is seen wearing a high hat and his head constantly falls off to the side.
*In the German translation of the second game (PS1 version), Nicholas states that it is his 150th deathday. Which would incorrectly place his death in [[1842]].
*Sir Nicholas was the first ghost named in the series.
*Sir Nicholas is the only House Ghost who did not live during the founders' time.
