'''Professor Remus John<ref name="WBD" /> Lupin''', {{OM|First}}, ([[10 March]] [[1960]]–[[2 May]] [[1998]]), also known as '''Moony''', was a [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the only son of [[Lyall Lupin|Lyall]] and [[Hope Howell|Hope Lupin]] {{Comment|née Howell}}. He was attacked by [[werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]] when he was a child, a result of Greyback's revenge against Lyall, leaving Remus afflicted with [[lycanthropy]] for life.<ref name="POA17" /> He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1971]] to [[1978]] and was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. During his school years he was one of the [[Marauders]], best friends with [[Sirius Black]], [[James Potter I|James Potter]], and [[Peter Pettigrew]]. Together, they created the [[Marauder's Map]].

After Hogwarts, Remus and his friends joined the original [[Order of the Phoenix]] and fought in the [[First Wizarding War]]. However, Pettigrew betrayed James and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]] to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] a week after he was made the couples' [[Secret Keeper]]. Thus Remus had lost all of his closest friends in various ways by the end of the First Wizarding War. The loss of his friends devastated him, though he and Sirius Black later rekindled their friendship. 

Remus taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as Professor of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] during the [[1993–1994 school year]]. Remus was regarded by students to be the best Defence teacher they have had thus far. He was also a professor of [[Harry Potter]] (James' son) whom he taught how to conjure a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], but resigned after [[Severus Snape]] revealed to the public that Remus was a [[werewolf]]. 

He fought against [[Death Eaters]] once more in the [[Second Wizarding War]], during which he lost his friend Sirius. In [[1997]], Remus married fellow Order member [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and had a son, [[Edward Lupin|Edward Remus Lupin]], of whom he named Harry the godfather. Remus fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on [[2 May]] [[1998]], during which his wife was murdered by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Remus was also murdered by Death Eater [[Antonin Dolohov]], during the first half of the same battle. His death was avenged by [[Filius Flitwick]].

Remus briefly appeared again through the [[Resurrection Stone]] for Harry, along with James Potter, Lily Potter, and Sirius Black in 1998. After his death, his son was raised by [[Andromeda Tonks]] and Harry Potter.

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1960–1971}}===
Remus was born on [[10 March]] [[1960]] to [[Lyall Lupin|Lyall]] and [[Hope Howell|Hope Lupin]]. His father worked at the Ministry of Magic and encountered the werewolf [[Fenrir Greyback]], who was on trial for killing two children. Lyall was the only one at court to realise that Greyback was a werewolf, as Greyback pretended to be a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] tramp. Outraged when Greyback was released, he voiced the opinion that Greyback deserved nothing but death. 

This opinion cost the Lupin family dearly, as Greyback decided to revenge himself upon Lyall by targeting his son. As the nearly five-year-old Remus slept peacefully in his bed, Greyback forced his way in through the window. Though Lyall was able to get there in time to drive Greyback off with powerful spells, he was unable to prevent him from completing his evil goal. Remus became infected with [[lycanthropy]] and he became a werewolf himself.<ref name="PM">{{WW|remus-lupin}}</ref> 

His parents took him to various [[healer]]s and tried their best to make him a normal boy again, but there was no cure for his condition. But Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] made special accommodations allowing Remus to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="PM" />

===Hogwarts years {{C|1971–1978}}===
{{Quote|My transformations in those days were — were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits.|Description of Lupin's transformations|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Sorting Ceremony 1971.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Remus's Sorting in 1971, where he was sorted into Gryffindor]]
Remus attended Hogwarts in [[1971]] and was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. To secure his safety, as well as that of his peers, Remus would be brought to the [[Shrieking Shack]] once a month for his transformations in order to prevent him from attacking other students. However, this isolation caused him to attack himself out of frustration. This, and the painful monthly transformations, made the villagers of [[Hogsmeade]] mistake his screams for that of violent [[ghost]]s. Dumbledore, wanting to keep the truth of these noises a secret, encouraged these rumours. Thus, the building was dubbed the Shrieking Shack, which held the reputation for being the most haunted building in Britain.<ref name="POA18" />

Remus became the very best of friends with fellow Gryffindors [[Sirius Black]], [[James Potter I|James Potter]], and [[Peter Pettigrew]]. He kept his status as a [[werewolf]] a secret from all of the students at Hogwarts, including Sirius, James, and Peter, his fellow Marauders and future Order members. He made up stories to explain his monthly disappearances, such as that his mother was ill and he needed to go home to visit her. He was terrified that they would desert him once they found out what he truly was. However, Sirius, James, and Peter worked out the truth during their second year, and due to their acceptance of who Remus was, and their unusually strong friendship with him, they decided to learn how to become [[Animagus|Animagi]] in order to keep Remus company during his transformations, as a werewolf is only a danger to humans.<ref name="POA18" />

[[File:Marauders.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Marauders in their Animagus forms, Lupin as a werewolf, on the far left]]
By their fifth year, Sirius was able to become a [[dog]], and James was able to become a [[Deer|stag]], animals large enough to keep the wolfish Remus in check. Peter, meanwhile, was able to become a [[rat]]. Once a month during the full moon, Sirius, James and Peter would sneak out of the castle under James' [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]], transform, get into the [[Whomping Willow]], walk down the tunnel and meet up with Remus in the Shrieking Shack. 

Under their influence, Lupin became tame; his body was still a wolf's, but his mind became less so when he was among them. The four of them soon left the Whomping Willow and would roam among the school grounds and [[Hogsmeade]] by night. Eventually, this group of friends came to call themselves the Marauders, and Remus' friends nicknamed him "Moony" because of his transformations during every full [[moon]].<ref name="POA">{{POA}}</ref>

Remus was a good student, but also a prankster. He and Peter Pettigrew would sometimes join Sirius and James in detention for mischief-making, though they did not get into as much trouble as their other friends. It's unlikely that any other Hogwarts students ever found out as much about the Hogwarts grounds and [[Hogsmeade]] as they did and Sirius, James, Remus and Peter used their knowledge of it to write the [[Marauder's Map]] and signed it with their nicknames.<ref name="POA18" /> Unfortunately, it somehow ended up being confiscated by [[Argus Filch]], but was eventually recovered by [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] in the 1989-90 school year.<ref name="POA10" />

[[File:Mauraders.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Marauders]] in their final years at Hogwarts]]
However, Remus' frequent disappearances riled up an unhealthy curiosity in [[Severus Snape]], a [[Slytherin]] student whom the Marauders often bullied, in the same year as Remus. Because of Severus' enmity towards Sirius and James, he disliked Remus and Peter by association, making him all the more suspicious. He often followed Sirius, James, Remus, and Peter around in order to see what they were up to and in an effort to have them expelled from Hogwarts.<ref name="POA18" />

Sometime in their fifth-year<ref>In {{POA|B|22}}, Snape says he was nearly killed in a prank by Sirius who was sixteen when it happened. Sirius was born in Nov 1959. He turned sixteen in Nov 1975, when he was in the fifth-year. 
According to {{DH|B|33}}, the prank happened before they took their O.W.L.s in June 1976.  So the prank had to have happened between Nov 1975 and June 1976.</ref>, Sirius played a malicious prank on Snape by telling him about the [[Hogwarts Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] passageway, hoping that he would be terrified or even get seriously hurt by what he found at the other end. James, who hated Snape, was able to stop Snape and save his life in the nick of time, but Snape still uncovered Remus' secret, seeing him at the end of the passage.

Remus was also a [[Prefect]] while he was at Hogwarts, although he had trouble exercising discipline over his dearest friend due to loyalty. He claimed Albus Dumbledore had hoped he could exert control over them as a Prefect. Sirius later told Harry that Remus wasn't an idiot like his friends because he was never cruel to Snape. But Remus admitted that he regretted that he had never stepped in to stop it.<ref name="OTP">{{OOTP}}</ref>

===First Wizarding War {{C|1978–1981}}===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Remus|...he thought I was the spy, Peter. I assume that's why you didn't tell me, Sirius?|Sirius Black|Forgive me, Remus.|Not at all, Padfoot, old friend. And will you forgive me for believing you were the spy?|Of course.|Reflecting on the First Wizarding War|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:The Marauders in Order of the Pheonix image.jpg|250px|thumb|Remus (far left) during the [[First Wizarding War]]]]
Shortly after graduating from Hogwarts, Remus joined the Order of the Phoenix along with Sirius, [[James Potter I|James]], [[Peter Pettigrew|Peter]], and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], standing up against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. Remus failed to find employment following his education because of his affliction as a werewolf. However, James used his wealth to financially support him.<ref name="CarnegieHall">[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more JK Rowling comments at Carnegie Hall]</ref>

By the height of the war, Remus' friend [[Sirius Black]] had come to distrust him, suspecting that he might be a spy for the other side. Thus, when a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] was made about a child who would have the power to defeat the Dark Lord, and Dumbledore identified infant [[Harry Potter]] as a possible target, Remus was not included in the plan to keep the [[Potter family|Potters]] safe, though he was aware that they used the [[Fidelius Charm]]. James and Lily Potter wanted to use Sirius as their [[Secret Keeper|Secret-Keeper]], but Sirius thought that would be too obvious, and thus suggested Peter Pettigrew instead, who would be a nearly unpredictable move, him being known for his "''measly empty-headedness''." Neither Dumbledore or Lupin knew of this switch.<ref name="POA" />

At the time of Lily and James' death, Lupin was in the north of the country on [[Order of the Phoenix]] business when he discovered what had, apparently, happened. This was one of the most traumatic events of Remus' life, especially since, within the next day, he would also be losing his other two best friends. Sirius was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for supposedly murdering Pettigrew and twelve Muggles with one [[Blasting Curse|curse]].<ref name="PM" />

===Between the wars {{C|1981–1994}}===
====Deal with Chiara Lobosca====
After Voldemort's first downfall, the [[Order of the Phoenix]] disbanded, and members returned to their busy lives with their families. Lupin, however, was left lonely and unhappy — two of his three best friends were dead, one was imprisoned for mass murder, his mother had eventually died too, and he refused to spoil his father's peaceful existence by returning to live with him. Remus was forced to take jobs that were far below his level of ability, always knowing he would have to leave them before his workmates noticed the signs of his lycanthropy. A faint ray of hope came for Remus when he heard of the new invention of the [[Wolfsbane Potion]], which can mitigate the worst effects of lycanthropy, though this was almost immediately dashed when he saw the potion's complexity and expensive ingredients. Potions was not his strongest suit and he had a very low income.
[[File:Remus Lupin and Chiara Lobosca.png|250px|thumb|left|Remus and Chiara]]
Unable to afford the potion or its ingredients, Lupin attempted to forage for the latter in the [[Forbidden Forest]], where he ran into Hogwarts student [[Chiara Lobosca]]. Chiara was also a werewolf, and was willing to give him the potion on a few occasions. They would meet each night for a week before a full moon, during which Chiara would give Lupin a bottle of potion.<ref name="chiara3">{{HM|2|Packmates|3}}</ref> 

During the [[1985–1986 school year]], [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Ben Copper]] witnessed a potion transaction between the two. Upon inquiry, Lobosca admitted that, unbeknownst to Lupin, she was giving him potions made for her since, at that time, the school stock of ingredients was only enough to make a dose for one person and she felt he needed them more than she did.<ref>{{HM|2|Packmates|2}}</ref> Upon hearing this, Lupin, who had been led to believe that her supply of potion was such that she had plenty to share, initially refused to take it. However, Chiara convinced him that it would do her no good that close to the full moon, while allowing him to experience the full effect. He reluctantly accepted a last potion from her, but then refused in advance to accept any more.<ref name="chiara3" />

At some point during their dealings, Lupin gave Chiara [[James Potter's photograph of Hogwarts|a photograph]] of [[Hogwarts Castle]] at sunset that [[James Potter I|James]] had taken, to remind her that the difficult nights would always pass. She would later give this photo to [[Jacob's sibling]] after her friend helped her during her own transformation.<ref name="chiara4">{{HM|2|Packmates|4}}</ref> 
====Becoming a professor====
{{Quote|Nothing to worry about. There's a Boggart in there. Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces. Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks — I've even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practise.|Remus Lupin teaching third year Defence Against the Dark Arts students about [[Boggart]]s|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
By the early [[1990s]], Lupin was living in poverty, in a tumbledown, semi-derelict cottage in Yorkshire. [[Albus Dumbledore]] tracked Lupin down in the summer of 1993, and offered him the post of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] Professor at Hogwarts, replacing the permanently amnesiac [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]. Lupin only accepted Dumbledore's proposal when he explained there would be a limitless supply of [[Wolfsbane Potion]], courtesy of Severus Snape, now the [[Potions Master]] at the school.<ref name="PM" />

[[File:LupinExpectoPatronum.gif|250px|thumb|right|Remus fending off a Dementor that boarded the Hogwarts Express in search of Sirius Black]]
Lupin travelled to Hogwarts via the [[Hogwarts Express]]. It was here where Remus first directly met [[Harry Potter]]. Lupin was apparently sleeping so deeply that he did not notice Hermione's attempt to wake him up to buy some food from the [[Honeydukes Express]], but swiftly awoke to deal with a [[Dementor]] who was prowling in their cabin in search for the runaway Sirius. He also conjured [[Hand-held flames]] to deal with the darkness produced by the Dementor's presance.

Remus disguised his [[wolf]]-shaped [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] as a vague mist to prevent leaving hints about his afflictions. He then gave everybody within the compartment a piece of [[chocolate]], as a mild remedy for the effects of the Dementor's powers. While doing so he greeted Harry in a casual and friendly fashion.<ref name="POA5">{{POA|B|5}}</ref>

Although Remus did not receive much enthusiasm from most students' applause during his introduction due to his rather shabby appearance, Harry and his friends were the few who gave their full approval due to the positive first impression he gave them. The students were kept in the dark about his affliction, but the staff were made aware that he was a werewolf. [[Severus Snape]], who had switched sides at the end of the [[First Wizarding War|war]] and became [[Potions (class)|Potions]] Professor, provided Remus with Wolfsbane Potion, allowing him to retain his human mind during transformations.<ref name="POA18">{{POA|B|18}}</ref>

[[File:Remus Lupin at Defence Against the Dark Arts class.jpg|244x244px|thumb|left|Remus Lupin teaching a third year DADA class]]
Remus taught the class a comprehensive and fascinating curriculum of identifying and sidestepping Dark creatures such as: [[Hinkypunk]]s,<ref name="POA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref> [[Red Cap]]s,<ref name="POA8" /> [[Kappa]]s,<ref name="POA8" /> [[Grindylow]]s,<ref name="POA8" /> [[Vampire]]s, [[Werewolf|Werewolves]], and [[Nocturnal beasts]]. He also taught the class about [[Boggart]]s, and how to repel them using the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]], to great success.<ref name="POA7">{{POA|B|7}}</ref> Remus had proven himself a skilled teacher, managing to keep the children's' interest in the subject and had shown himself far more competent than his predecessor's vain, useless lessons. 

[[File:Remus Harry Anti-Dementor lessons.png|250px|thumb|right|Harry Potter's first lesson on the [[Patronus Charm]]]] 
It was during their Boggart class that [[Harry Potter|Harry]] realised his "''greatest fear was fear itself''" when his [[Boggart]] took on the form of a [[Dementor]]. After this, Remus gave Harry private lessons in producing a [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] as a means to repel [[Dementor]]s, when it became apparent that he was especially vulnerable to them because, according to Lupin, Harry had "true horrors" in his past that were especially appealing to the Dementors.<ref name="POA12">{{POA|B|12}}</ref> Incidentally, being a werewolf, Remus' Boggart would take on the form of the full moon. Students who saw this Boggart form mistook it for a crystal ball, except for [[Hermione Granger]], who cleverly deduced that Remus was a werewolf and kept the discovery to herself.<ref name="POA17">{{POA|B|17}}</ref>

[[Slytherin]] students, encouraged by [[Draco Malfoy]], sneered at Remus' shabby clothes and poor appearance, although he seemed to ignore their comments.<ref name="POA8">{{POA|B|8}}</ref> Regardless, his other students held him in extremely high regard and loved the hands-on style of his classes. He was considered by Harry and his friends to have been their only decent Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.

[[File:PM-templ.png|250px|thumb|left|Lupin in Professor Snape's fireplace, having used [[Floo Powder]] to get there]]
Remus was soon summoned to Snape's office to identify whether a piece of parchment he caught Harry with to be Dark magic. Remus recognised it as the Marauder's Map but tried to pass it off as a product of [[Zonko's Joke Shop]]. At the same moment, Ron burst in to back up that claim. After escorting the two boys from Snape's office, Remus told them that he knew what the map was and was more astounded that they did not hand it in, and reprimanded Harry, much to their surprise. He confiscated the map, knowing that it would be too dangerous for Harry to use the secret passages with Sirius on the loose.<ref name="POA14">{{POA|B|14}}</ref>

For his third years' end of year tests in June, he prepared an unusual exam — an obstacle course out in the grounds in which the students had to: wade across a paddling pool containing a [[grindylow]]; cross a series of pot-holes full of Red Caps; cross a marsh while being fed misleading directions by a hinkypunk; and enter a trunk to battle a newly procured boggart.<ref name="POA16">{{POA|B|16}}</ref> Hermione Granger even commented in her fifth year that Lupin's exam was the only occasion where she and Harry took a Defence exam from a teacher who knew what they were doing (exams were cancelled in second year and Harry was exempt due to his status as a Triwizard Champion in fourth year).

====Exposure of Peter Pettigrew====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Lupin|Didn't you ever hear, Ron? The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger.|Ron Weasley| Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He's been in my family for ages, right —|Twelve years, in fact. Didn't you ever wonder why he was living so long?|Lupin exposing Peter Pettigrew as an Animagus|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
The summer before Remus began his tenure as the Defence professor, [[Sirius Black]] escaped from [[Azkaban]]. Remus, like the rest of the wizarding world, believed that Sirius had betrayed the [[Potter family|Potters]] to Voldemort and murdered Peter Pettigrew.
[[File:B3C19M1 Shrieking Shack Wormtail revealed.jpg|alt=|thumb|251x251px|Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew in the Shrieking Shack]]
By the end of the school year, however, Remus knew the truth of what had happened and that Pettigrew was still alive, hiding in his [[Animagus]] form — [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]], the pet rat of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. He was watching the Marauder's Map, expecting Harry and his friends to go down to see Hagrid before [[Buckbeak]]'s execution and was shocked to see Pettigrew coming out of Hagrid's with them. 

Remus was reunited with his old friend Sirius, and the two resolved to kill Pettigrew for his part in the deaths of James and Lily and in framing Sirius. They were stopped by Harry Potter, who believed it would be better to hand Pettigrew over to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] to prove Sirius' innocence, and also did not think his father would want Remus and Sirius to become killers.<ref name="POA">{{POA}}</ref>

====Werewolf transformation====
{{Quote|There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin's head was lengthening. So was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws.|Lupin transforming into a werewolf under the moonlight|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Remus Lupin turning into Werewolf.gif|250px|thumb|left|Remus transforms into a werewolf|alt=]]
However, that night happened to be a full moon, and Remus transformed into a [[werewolf]] (having forgotten to take the [[Wolfsbane Potion]]). Sirius was forced to turn into his Animagus form to protect Harry, Ron and Hermione from Remus. In the chaos, Pettigrew unfortunately escaped and would later return to his master. After the attempted attack on Harry and Hermione, Remus spent the rest of the night deep in the [[Forbidden Forest]].<ref name="POA" />

====Resignation====
{{Quote|This time tomorrow, the [[owl]]s will start arriving from parents... They will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you... That must never happen again.|Lupin explaining his resignation to Harry|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:B3C22M1 Lupin leaving his office and teaching post.png|250px|thumb|Harry Potter and Dumbledore seeing Remus off|alt=]]
After the danger had passed, Remus resigned from his position when parents learned that he was a werewolf. His sudden resignation was much to the regret of the majority of the Hogwarts students and staff, who had all grown deeply fond of him.<ref name="POA" /> Harry, in particular, begged him earnestly to stay, declaring that he was the best Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher that the students had ever had. Remus simply shook his head, handed him the Marauder's Map and also returned the [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]] that was left at the [[Shrieking Shack]], and told him that it had been a real pleasure teaching him, and that he was perfectly sure that they would soon meet again.<ref name="POA" />

He sent [[Remus Lupin's letter to Alastor Moody|a letter]] to his [[Alastor Moody|successor]] informing him of what he taught Harry and the others, but it was [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|intercepted]].<ref name="GOF14">{{GOF|B|14}}</ref>

===Second Wizarding War {{C|1995–1998}}===
{{Quote|They're trying to discredit him. Didn't you see the Daily Prophet last week? They reported that he'd been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he's getting old and losing his grip, but it's not true, he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort's return. They've demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot — that's the Wizard High Court — and they're talking about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too.|Remus regarding the Minister's denial of Voldemort's return|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:B5C3M1 Advance Guard at Privet Drive.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Remus as a member of the Order's [[Advance Guard]]]]
When [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] returned, Remus rejoined the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He was a member of the [[Advance Guard]] that escorted Harry Potter from [[4 Privet Drive]] to [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. The Advance Guard also contained: [[Alastor Moody]], [[Emmeline Vance]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Elphias Doge]], [[Dedalus Diggle|Dedalus Diggle,]] [[Hestia Jones]], and [[Sturgis Podmore]]. Lupin lived for some time at Sirius' house, but he was not around very often as he was usually sent on many missions for the Order.

Remus also accompanied Sirius in conversation with Harry through the fireplace at Grimmauld Place, when Harry used the [[Floo Powder]] from the fireplace in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher's office|Dolores Umbridge's office]] to talk with Black about his father James and Snape's memory, which he saw in the [[Pensieve]]. Lupin, like Sirius, did not hide his indignation when he learned that Snape had stopped teaching Harry the [[Occlumency]].<ref name="OOTP29">{{OOTP|B|29}}</ref>

[[File:Battle of the Department of Mysteries GIF.gif|250px|thumb|right|Remus duelling a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] in the Death Chamber of the Department of Mysteries]]
On [[18 June]] 1996, Remus participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and defeated a number of Death Eaters including their leader, [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He was one of the only three combatants to see the end of the battle unscathed, the others being [[Albus Dumbledore]] and [[Harry Potter]], proving Remus' exceptional skill at duelling. 

During this battle, Remus witnessed and was devastated by the death of his last surviving Marauder friend, [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], who was pushed through the [[veil]] in the Death Chamber by a [[Bellatrix Lestrange's unidentified spell|spell]] cast by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].<ref name="OOTP35">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref> Remus barely managed to prevent Harry from diving in after Sirius, who was already lost.<ref name="OOTP36">{{OOTP|B|36}}</ref>

Shortly after the battle and the end of school year, Remus along with Moody, Tonks and Weasleys confronted the Dursleys at [[King's Cross Station|King's Cross]] station over their treatment of Harry.<ref name="ootp38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>

====Underground====

[[File:Tonks Molly Arthur Lupin.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Remus and Tonks at the Burrow during the Second Wizarding War]]
Some weeks later, Remus began working as a spy for the Order, living among fellow [[werewolf|werewolves]] and trying to convince them to join Dumbledore's side. It is said that he volunteered just to keep away from Tonks, as they were both very much in love with each other by this point and he would not risk his child having lycanthropy. Alas, it was difficult to convince them due to the fact that they believed they will have a better life under Voldemort's reign, many were frightened and intimidated by [[Fenrir Greyback]] and that Remus showed signs of living among humans.<ref name="HBP16" />

Weeks later, on Harry's 16th birthday, Remus visited [[The Burrow]] with news of Dementor attacks and murder of [[Igor Karkaroff]].<ref name="hbp6">{{HBP|B|6}}</ref>

[[File:Lupin Burrow2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Lupin arguing with Harry, Tonks and Arthur during Christmas at the Burrow]] 
During Christmas at the Burrow, Harry told Remus and Arthur Weasley about the  conversation he overheard between [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Severus Snape]]. [[Arthur Weasley]] immediately suggested that Snape was just pretending to help Malfoy, but Lupin severely pointed out that Dumbledore trusted Snape, which "''ought to be good enough for all of them''". Although Snape exposed Lupin as a werewolf, forcing him to resign his position at Hogwarts, he also kept him healthy by making him a special potion during his monthly transformation. 

Lupin neither liked nor disliked Snape — but personal feelings have nothing to do with his decision to trust him. Lupin argued strongly against making judgments based on feelings — even though he, of all people, had strong reasons to dislike Snape personally, he refused to let this affect his conclusions about the man. This pronouncement established him as a foil to [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and Sirius, who disliked Snape for petty reasons and treated these feelings as a justification for bullying him.<ref name="HBP16">{{HBP|B|16}}</ref>

[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|left|The funeral of Albus Dumbledore that Remus attended with Tonks]]
The following year, Remus fought bravely again at the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] where he narrowly avoided death by a [[Killing Curse|curse]] from [[Thorfinn Rowle]]. Remus was devastated upon hearing about the death of [[Albus Dumbledore]], who had been killed by Severus Snape. However, the aftermath of the battle led to him to accept the love of [[Nymphadora Tonks]], who pointed out that [[Fleur Delacour]] still loved [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] in spite of being attacked and scarred by [[Fenrir Greyback]]. The pair attended their former Headmaster's [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] together.<ref name="HBP">{{HBP}}</ref>

====Marriage====
Shortly after Dumbledore's funeral and some days before the Order operation to transport Harry from his relative's home to safety, Remus and Tonks soon married in the north of Scotland with only witnesses from the local tavern.<ref name="PM" /> Lupin, same as Tonks, was sad that Harry didn't attend their wedding, because he couldn't leave the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] home, due to Lily's [[Sacrificial protection|loving sacrifice]] when she willingly died for her only son. They were forced to marry quietly, given the general prejudice against werewolves.<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

Remus, to his surprise, learned that his wife got pregnant some time after the wedding.

[[File:DH1 Fleur, Bill Weasley, Nymphadora, Remus Lupin and Harry Potter.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Remus, Tonks and Order of Phoenix members at 4 Privet Drive]]
On [[27 July|27th July]] 1997, Remus participated in the Order's operation to remove Harry from his home before [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] could get to him. Remus acted as the protector of [[George Weasley]], who took [[Polyjuice Potion]] to become one of the "seven Potters." The party was ambushed by at least thirty cloaked [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="DH4">{{DH|B|4}}</ref> George was accidentally struck by Severus Snape, who was trying to aim for a Death Eater, but accidentally stuck George instead with his ''[[Sectumsempra]]'' curse while George and Remus flew. Lupin was unable to pay Snape back in time, it being all he could do to keep George on the broom, as the latter was losing a copious amount of blood.<ref name="DH5">{{DH|B|5}}</ref>

[[File:Lupin interrogating Harry.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Remus making sure that Harry is not an impostor in the Burrow's kitchen after the sky battle]]
He eventually got the injured George back to [[The Burrow]] to be cleaned up, though George permanently lost an ear. Upon arrival, Remus accosted Harry to prove that Harry was the real Harry. It was later revealed that Snape had sent the spell in an attempt to cut off the hand of a Death Eater aiming at Remus' back, presumably about to kill him. Remus was very anxious about the late arrival of his wife; Tonks had been aggressively pursued by her murderous, cruel aunt, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. When the party mourned the death of fellow order member [[Alastor Moody]], they discussed their betrayal. Harry voiced the opinion that he trusted all of them with his life. Remus urged caution, seeing as Harry's father was killed because he put his trust in the wrong friend.<ref name="DH5" />

====Wedding of Bill and Fleur====
[[File:DH1 wedding interrupted Remus making Harry leave.gif|250px|thumb|right|Remus defending the Burrow when Death Eaters attacked]]
In the next days Remus seemed to become withdrawn and sullen at the news. He awhile attended [[Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday|Harry's birthday party]], but left when [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] has arrived. Remus and Tonks both later attended the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] shortly afterwards, and bravely defended the Burrow when it came under attack as Voldemort took over the Ministry.<ref name="DH" />

Remus along with Tonks both used a [[Shield Charm]]. It is unknown as to whether he escaped, or he was questioned by the intruders, along with the other guests, before being released.<ref name="DH9">{{DH|B|9}}</ref>

====On the run====
{{Quote|Don't you understand what I've done to my wife and [[Edward Lupin|my unborn child]]? I should never have married her, I've made her an outcast! And the child — the child...my kind don't usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it! How can I forgive myself when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child?!

[[File:Remuslupin DH.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Remus visiting the trio in 12 Grimmauld Place, while on the run]]
Remus suffered great mental anguish as the war escalated when he learned that his wife was pregnant. He even tore out a clump of his own hair in anxiety over the possibility that his child would be born a werewolf. He visited Harry, Ron, and Hermione while they hid out in [[12 Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] and offered to help with their search for Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es. However, Harry denounced him, calling him a coward for even considering leaving his wife alone while pregnant. Remus got so mad that he flung Harry against the wall with his wand, and left, greatly agitated.<ref name="DH" />

Harry and his friends next heard of Remus on ''[[Potterwatch]]'', under the code name "Romulus". Remus made Harry realise that they were still good friends, with his putting forth the opinion that Harry's instincts were good and they were usually right.<ref name="DH" />

Remus eventually came to his senses and reunited with Tonks in time to see his son's birth. They named him Edward Remus "Teddy" Lupin, after Tonks' father, who had recently been murdered by [[Snatchers]] after refusing to turn himself in to the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. Appearing to forgive and forget their earlier disagreement in Grimmauld Place, Remus asked Harry to be Teddy's godfather.<ref name="DH" />

====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
{{Dialogue a-b|Nymphadora Tonks|Have you seen Remus?|Aberforth Dumbledore|He was duelling Dolohov, haven't seen him since!|Right before Lupin's death at the hands of Dolohov|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Tonks and Lupin preparing for battle.gif|250px|thumb|right|Remus and Tonks during the beginning stage of the final battle]]
Remus was one of the many Order members who answered [[Neville Longbottom]]'s call to arms on 1 May 1998, shortly before the start of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Harry, Hermione and Ron returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] gathered his army to attack the school in order to capture Harry Potter. He organised and led groups to fight [[Death Eaters]] on the school grounds, along with [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and [[Arthur Weasley]]. His wife initially agreed not to participate in the Battle of Hogwarts, instead staying with their infant son, but was ultimately unable to bear leaving her husband to face such danger without her.

=====Death=====
[[File:Remus Lupin & Nymphadora Tonks Deceased.png|250px|thumb|left|The bodies of a deceased Remus and Tonks in the [[Great Hall]]]]
She left Teddy with [[Andromeda Tonks|her mother]] and raced to Hogwarts, where she was informed that Remus was last seen duelling Death Eater [[Antonin Dolohov]].<ref name="OTP" /> Dolohov murdered Remus, who was no longer in prime fighting condition, due to months of protective and concealment charms in order to keep his wife and son safe from possible attacks.{{fact}} He was killed during the first half of the battle along with many others. These others included Tonks, his wife, who was murdered by her aunt [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].<ref>[http://www.mugglenet.com/app/news/full_story/1156 Bloomsbury Webchat with J.K. Rowling, 30 July 2007]</ref> Lupin's death was avenged by [[Filius Flitwick]] who defeated or possibly killed Dolohov.

===Post-mortem===
{{Quote|I am sorry too... Sorry I will never know him... but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand.|Lupin's parting words to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
During the brief pause in the battle, Remus and Tonks' bodies were laid out beside each other in the [[Great Hall]]. The nature of Remus' death was not revealed, but his body was described as peaceful-looking,<ref name="DH" /> implying that he was struck with either a [[Killing Curse]] or [[Antonin Dolohov's Curse|Dolohov's own curse]]; both are known to leave no visible marks on the outer body.

[[File:Harry-potter7-harry_lupin.jpg|250px|thumb|A resurrected Remus talking with Harry in the [[Forbidden Forest]]|alt=]]
However, Remus still had an important part to play in the war. When Harry proceeded to the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] camp to be struck down by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], he first activated the Resurrection Stone, bringing back the spirits of his parents, Sirius, and Remus; Remus expressed the hope that Harry would care for his son, lamenting that he would never know him, but also found comfort in the fact that his son would know and understand why he died: he was trying to make a world in which his son could live a happier life.

Remus Lupin was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Merlin]], First Class, the first werewolf ever to have been accorded this honour. The example of his life and death played an important role in lifting the stigma on werewolves among the wizarding society.<ref name="PM" />

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard's robes that had been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with grey.|Description of Lupin's outward appearance|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Remus Lupin profile.jpg|289x289px|thumb|left|Remus Lupin, age 36|alt=]]
Remus was described as having a pale face with premature lines, and light brown hair that, as he progressed through his thirties, became more and more grey. The lines on his face and his greying hair were the results of the great deal of stress his body underwent with each full moon. His clothing is consistently shabby and patched, presumably because of his inability to find a decently-paid job due to his status as a werewolf.

In [[1993]], he sported a thin moustache, and from [[1995]] until his death, he sported more of a rough beard. He had scars cutting across his face and given Remus' comments on werewolf inflicted injuries being cursed wounds that are unlikely to fully heal after [[Fenrir Greyback]]'s attack on [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], it is possible he had more scars from his self-inflicted injuries during his transformations. In death, however, finally free of his lycanthropy, the flaws of his appearance were rectified, just like his friend [[Sirius Black]]; his spirit was described as "''younger, less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker''."

He was also quite tall, standing six feet, two inches tall. His height was not often mentioned, but is notable as his height corresponded roughly to the full length of a wolf's body from nose to tail. His 162 pound weight also corresponded to his wolfish dimensions. 

In his werewolf form, he was a large beast with grey fur, and the only differences between his appearance and that of a true wolf being his shorter snout, more human eyes, and tufted tail. 

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.|Lupin bravely confronting a Dementor on the Hogwarts Express|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
Remus was compassionate, intelligent, tolerant, levelheaded, peaceful, selfless, brave, kind, and good-natured. Despite having suffered a great deal of prejudice in his life due to his [[lycanthropy]], he managed to retain an ability to see the good in almost everybody and was extremely forgiving. Remus also had an excellent sense of humour. When he was a student at school he was also part of the [[Marauders]].<ref name="POA" /> However, unlike his friends, he never partook in bullying. He hence could be described as the most mature and responsible one of the group. He even became a [[prefect]] in his fifth year.<ref name="OTP" /> Also he was able to, or at least would try to maintain civil conversation with those he did not get along well with.

[[File:Lupin1.gif|frame|Remus demonstrating his flair for the subject he teaches by adding the element of music to a lesson|alt=]] 
Remus was unusually perceptive, with an uncanny ability to guess the thoughts of those around him. This is especially clear in his conversations with [[Harry Potter]], such as his intuiting that Harry was afraid that he thought he couldn't handle working with the [[boggart]]. He was a gifted teacher, with a rare flair for his subject and a profound understanding of his pupils. He was, as ever, drawn to the underdog, and [[Neville Longbottom]] especially benefited from his wisdom and encouragement. His perceptive nature is a rather ironic trait, given that wolves are rather intuitive and astute judges of character and communicate primarily through body language, a skill that Remus was extremely developed and talented at.

{{Quote|There are worse things to lose than control.|Lupin reciprocating the altruism and compassion shown by Chiara Lobasca|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
[[File:Remus-lupin.png|250px|thumb|left|Remus standing anxiously in the [[Shrieking Shack]]|alt=]]
True to being a [[Gryffindor]], Lupin was quite courageous. Nonetheless, he suffered deep-seated feelings of shame and fear of rejection which, in certain situations, led him to consider backing down. His greatest weakness was that, in his desperate longing to belong and be liked, he was neither as brave or honest as he should have been at times. Remus once claimed that he was cowardly, because he was unable to bring himself to tell [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] that [[James Potter I|James Potter]], [[Sirius Black]], and [[Peter Pettigrew]] were [[Animagus|Animagi]], as it would have meant that he had betrayed Dumbledore's trust, which meant everything to him. 

His love for James and Sirius also led him to not do anything to stop their bullying other students, a most notable example being when Snape was constantly bullied by his friends, but Remus was terrified of losing them and therefore did nothing to stop the bullying, something that he later admits to regret. Perhaps the most critical example of this was his temptation to join Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] on Dumbledore's mission and abandon his wife and unborn son because he was afraid that her family would be ashamed of him being a werewolf. However, ultimately he came to his senses.

He also was known to dislike the form of his [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] as it took the shape of a wolf. Lupin was disgusted by all things wolfish as they reminded him of his condition, and due to this has been known to deliberately cast a non-corporeal Patronus, particularly when in the company of others, for fear it would give him away as a [[werewolf]]. The irony of this is that his desires to belong and be liked are that wolves are social animals, and often act in the interests of their pack, much like Remus' self-sacrificing nature, making him rather wolf-like even in his human form. In many ways, he represented the best parts of wolves, including his intelligence, adaptability, nurturing instincts, and his fierce desire to protect his loved ones.

[[File:Lupin's boggart.gif|250px|thumb|Remus' very fitting boggart form|alt=]]
His [[Boggart]] was a full [[moon]], reflecting on his terror of transforming into his [[werewolf]] form near [[human]]s. It also showed his immense hatred and shame over his [[Lycanthropy|condition]].<ref name="POA7">{{POA|B|7}}</ref>

Remus' nurturing instincts were incredibly wolfish. Due to his position being that of a moderator, teacher, and nurturer, Remus fit the wolf pack position of the "''nanny''" or sergeant, looking after and teaching younger wolves — in this case his students and younger Order members, and keeping his friends in line, albeit with limited success at times.

In contrast to Sirius' more competitive and combative nature, Remus was far more peaceful, reserved, and prone to negotiation despite his nature as a werewolf. This is symbolic of how dogs often tend to fight for dominance versus the more pragmatic and somewhat democratic nature of wolves in a pack who organise themselves peacefully unless threatened. However, Remus was by no means weak and marched into battle against Voldemort's soldiers like a true warrior. Remus referred to Voldemort by name, unafraid of the Dark Lord or his loyal Death Eaters.

[[File:Lupin Harry wedding DH part1.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Remus at Bill and Fleur's Wedding talking to [[Harry Potter]]|alt=]]
After losing James, Sirius and Lily and all hope of reconciliation with Pettigrew gone, Remus had every reason to succumb to depression and despondency. However, he retained his appreciation for the good people existing in his life and continued to draw strength from them. 

Lupin also must have been likely sceptical about [[Divination]], as [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] stated the he positively fled when she offered to [[Crystal-gazing|crystal gaze]] him<ref name="POA11">{{POA|B|11}}</ref> (on another hand he could be merely afraid of what kind of things she could see, as his [[lycanthropy]]). 

==Magical abilities and skills==
[[File:POA Remus Hogwarts Express against Dementor.gif|243x243px|thumb|Lupin conjuring a non-corporeal Patronus]]{{Quote|You're the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever had!|[[Harry Potter]] regarding Remus' skills|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
Remus Lupin was an accomplished and skilful wizard, with extensive knowledge of [[Dark Arts|Dark creatures]]. He also possessed the ability to properly impart practical and theoretical skills of defensive magic to others. Remus was capable of conjuring a corporeal wolf Patronus (a mark of superior magical ability).<ref name="PM1">{{PM}} - New from J.K. Rowling: "''DISASTROUS OPENING CEREMONY LEADS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP SECURITY''" (''Daily Prophet'', 12 April 2014)</ref> He also proved to be a skilful duellist, surviving numerous battles. However, by his own admission, [[Potion]]s was not his strong suit.

[[File:LupinRiddikulus.gif|240px|thumb|Lupin repelling his boggart with ''Riddikulus'']]
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': In [[1993]], Remus took the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]: Considered by most of his pupils to be the best teacher they had had in the subject, he was very knowledgeable on the subject of Dark [[creature]]s and how to handle them, as shown how he expertly taught this to [[Harry Potter]] and his classmates during their third year. During his classes, he taught students about [[Red Cap]]s, [[Grindylow]]s, [[Kappa]]s, [[Vampire]]s, [[Werewolf|Werewolves]], [[Nocturnal beasts]] and [[Boggart]]s (and how to repel them using the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]]), showing him to have had excellent knowledge of such fiendish creatures and the necessary defence against them. Known to have displayed a rare flair for his own subject, he would also have been very proficient on the subject of [[counter-curse]]s and defensive spell-work, and, being a very proficient duellist, might very well have helped some of his older students become accomplished in combative magic themselves. He also taught Harry Potter the highly advanced [[Patronus Charm]] to defend himself against [[Dementor]]s,<ref name="POA" /> which he himself must have mastered at a relatively young age, at least when he joined the first [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Remus' Patronus took the form of a [[wolf]], a reflection of his condition, but he could disguise it into a non-corporeal form to hide that fact.<ref name="PM" />
{{Quote|There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames.|Lupin using a nonverbal flame spell|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}

*'''[[Wandless magic|Wandless]] and [[Nonverbal spell|non-verbal magic]]''': While on the [[Hogwarts Express]] in [[1993]], Remus conjured fire (possibly [[Bluebell Flames]]) [[Wandless magic|without using a wand]] and non-verbally.<ref name="POA5" /> He could also [[Unlocking Charm|open]] locks and chests and [[Fire-Making Spell|relight candles]] with just the wave of his hand. When Remus and Harry had a heated argument in [[1997]], Remus struck him with a silent [[Knockback Jinx]] so quickly that Harry barely had time to reach for [[Harry Potter's wand|his own]] [[wand]].<ref name="DH" /> These were a testament to Remus being a truly powerful wizard, as both wandless and non-verbal magic are very difficult.

*'''[[Duelling]]''': Remus was a highly talented duellist. During the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], he was the only fighter besides [[Albus Dumbledore]] and his pupil, Harry, who was not wounded, killed, or incapacitated. He was seen duelling [[Lucius Malfoy]] (the leader of the Death Eaters) in order to defend Harry and Neville from him and was able to emerge unscathed.<ref name="OTP" /> He also came out of the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]<ref name="HBP" /> unscathed, and later survived the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] despite his having to support an injured [[George Weasley]] while fighting and flying during the conflict. Remus was also willing to personally fight the exceptionally skilled [[Severus Snape]] after the latter injured George Weasley, though he opted instead to get himself and George to safety. Remus was ultimately killed in a duel during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] with [[Antonin Dolohov]], a highly skilled and dangerous [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], who had previously defeated extremely talented wizards such as [[Alastor Moody]] and the Prewett brothers, though chances were that he had put up an excellent fight; this downfall was due to Remus' months of staying at home with his wife under various [[protective enchantment]]s, the inactivity dulling his reflexes enough to weaken him for Dolohov to finally kill him.<ref name="DH" />
{{Quote|So Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away...|Lupin's use of the Patronus Charm on a [[Dementor]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}

*'''[[Charm]]s''': Remus was shown to have been talented in charms from a young age: as teenagers, he and his fellow Marauders ([[James Potter I|James]], [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], and [[Peter Pettigrew|Peter]]) managed to create the magically complex [[Marauder's Map]] with the [[Homonculous Charm]], the magic of which endured even long after the deaths of all four Marauders.<ref name="POA" /> He was also able to cast a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] (form of a [[wolf]]), which is regarded as a very advanced piece of [[magic]] as well as a sign of superior magical ability. The fact that he was even able to decide whether he wanted his Patronus to be corporeal or not was also a testament to his extraordinary talent in charms.<ref name="PM2">{{WW|patronus-charm}}</ref> He was capable of casting numerous other enchantments, such as the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]], [[Seize and pull charm]], [[Pack Charm]], [[Freezing Spell]], [[Freezing Charm]], [[Shield Charm]], [[General Counter-Spell]], [[Bandaging Charm]], [[Disarming Charm]], [[Projectile Jinx]], ''[[Mobilicorpus]]'', [[Knockback Jinx]], [[Water-heating spell]] and even producing [[Hand-held flames]], for example.

{{Quote|[[Bandaging Charm|Ferula]]." Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.|Remus bandaging [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s leg|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': In the spring of [[1994]], Remus effectively used the [[Bandaging Charm]] to bandage and splint broken bones on Ron, whose leg had been broken, showing him to have been skilled in the art of medical magic and with the casting of [[healing spell]]s.<ref name="POA" />

[[File:Animagusreversalspell.png|245px|thumb|Remus and Sirius performing the [[Animagus reversal spell]] on Pettigrew]]

*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Remus, along with Sirius, was able to perform [[Untransfiguration]] to force Peter to change into his human form (Peter's [[Animagus]] form was a [[rat]]). He was also able to perform [[conjuration]], which is an incredibly advanced form of Transfiguration: in [[1994]], he once [[Incarcerous Spell|conjured chains]] to bind Peter to Ron. This shows he was highly proficient in this notably very difficult and complicated branch of [[magic]].<ref name="POA" />
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Remus was chosen to lead the [[Advance Guard]] when they escorted Harry from [[4 Privet Drive]] in [[1995]],<ref name="OTP" /> and he was able to evade and duel [[Death Eaters]] while supporting an injured [[George Weasley|George]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] in [[1997]].<ref name="DH" />
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Being an accomplished wizard, Remus was capable of Apparating successfully. In [[1997]], he Apparated to [[12 Grimmauld Place]] to escape the [[Death Eaters]] from reaching him, allowing him to escape potential capture.<ref name="DH" />
*'''Indomitable willpower''': Lupin, in spite of his [[Lycanthropy]] and the life struggles he suffered as a result of it, was shown to have an incredibly strong willpower. During his school years, he was the only one among the four [[Marauders]] who did not participate in bullying [[Severus Snape]] and other people even though he regretted not taking enough action to stop his other three friends from bullying them. Despite losing his three best friends when [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] suffered his first defeat when attempting to murder [[Harry Potter]] and being forced to live a lifestyle of poverty for 13 years as a result, Lupin never lost his appreciation for the good people still existing in his life which allowed him to accept [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s offer for him to teach [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Additionally, in spite of [[Sirius Black|Sirius]]'s death at the hands of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], Lupin still retained enough emotional strength to restrain Harry from running through the [[veil]] after Sirius's body, check if Harry's friends were safe and unlike Harry, avoid pursuing revenge on Bellatrix even though the devastation of losing his last surviving Marauder friend was great for him. As he still drew strength from the good people in his life, this allowed him to keep fighting for the [[Order of the Phoenix]] against Voldemort and his [[Death Eaters]], with Lupin notably never being afraid of uttering the Dark Lord's name aloud. When [[George Weasley]]'s ear was accidentally cursed off by Severus Snape, Lupin managed to carry George to safety even though he wished to have paid Snape back in kind, showing that his concern for others was greater than his longtime feud with Snape. Even though he was tempted to abandon his wife [[Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora]] and [[Edward Lupin|their unborn child]] out of fear of passing his Lycanthropy to their son, he returned to his senses after a row with Harry and spent the rest of the war and his life protecting them and the other people he cared about. The level of willpower and courage Lupin displayed throughout his life to keep fighting for what was good despite having every reason to succumb to depression was what resulted in him being posthumously awarded the [[Order of Merlin]] First Class, being the first [[werewolf]] in history to receive that honour.
*'''[[Occlumency]] and [[Legilimency]] (possibly)''': Remus was described as having “''an odd, closed expression''” right before he lied to [[Severus Snape]], a skilled [[Legilimency|Legilimens]]. During his stay at Grimmauld Place, he was able to communicate with Sirius Black (also a possible Occlumens) while the two maintained eye contact for a lengthy period of time.
*'''Teaching skills''': Despite his lack of previous teaching experience and poor lifestyle, Remus nevertheless proved to be a very skilled and talented teacher when he was briefly the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. This was because his lessons were more practical rather than theoretical and he had a profound understanding of his students, which motivated even [[Neville Longbottom]] to improve. He was an enthusiastic teacher, inspiring students to take part and was very fair. Unlike the two teachers before him, he actually had a desire to teach students. As a result of his effective teaching methods, almost everyone (except some of the [[Slytherin]] students) regarded him as the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ever in the school despite his poor and shabby appearance and the revelation that he was a werewolf. His teaching skills were also effective enough to keep the Slytherin students and other wrongdoers under control even though they were critical of his poor and shabby appearance.<ref name="POA" />

==Possessions==
[[File:Remus wand.jpg|170px|thumb|Remus' wand-10 and 1/4, cypress, contains unicorn hair core]]

*'''[[Remus Lupin's wand|Wand]]''': Like the vast majority of witches and wizards, it could be said that Remus' [[wand]] was most likely purchased at the age of eleven from [[Ollivanders]], and was counted among his most valued possessions. His wand was 10¼", [[Cypress]] [[Wand wood|wood]], and with [[unicorn hair]] [[Wand core|core]].
*'''[[Remus Lupin's cottage|Cottage]]''': In [[1993]], Remus lived alone in a cottage in Yorkshire, England. Albus Dumbledore tracked him to this cottage and offered him the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
*'''[[Remus Lupin's walking stick|Walking stick]]''': Remus used a walking stick after 1993 to facilitate his weakened state, induced by [[lycanthropy]].<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Family===
The extent of Remus' relationship with his family is unknown, aside from how adored he was by his parents. During Remus' youth, [[Lyall Lupin|his father]] offended Fenrir Greyback, causing Greyback to attack Remus, when he was merely four years old. [[Lyall Lupin|Mr]] and [[Hope Howell|Mrs Lupin]] are known to have been concerned over Remus being a werewolf, believing that this condition meant their son would be unable to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. However, this was proven untrue.

====Nymphadora Tonks====
{{Dialogue a-b-c-b-d|Nymphadora Tonks|I don't care either, I don't care! I've told you a million times ''[...]''  |Remus|And I've told ''you'' a million times, that I am too old for you, too poor....too dangerous....|Molly Weasley|I've said all along you're taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus.|I am not being ridiculous.

[[File:Nymphadora Tonks DH promo headshot .jpg|thumb|left|[[Nymphadora Tonks]], his wife and mother of his son]]
Remus and Tonks came to know each other as members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Remus, so often melancholy and lonely, was first amused, then impressed, then seriously smitten by the witch. He had never fallen in love before. If it had happened in peacetime, Remus would have simply taken himself off to a new place and a new job, so that he did not have to endure the pain of watching Tonks fall in love with a handsome, young wizard in the [[Auror Office]] (which was what he expected to happen). However, this was war; they were both needed in the Order of the Phoenix, and nobody knew what the next day would bring. Remus felt justified in remaining exactly where he was, keeping his feelings to himself but secretly rejoicing every time somebody paired him with Tonks on some overnight mission.

It had never occurred to Remus that Tonks could return his feelings because he had become so used to considering himself unclean and unworthy. One night when they lay in hiding outside a known Death Eater's house, after a year of increasingly warm friendship, Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members (''"He's still handsome, isn't he, even after Azkaban?''"). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend ("''He always got the women.''"). At this, Tonks replied: "''You'd know perfectly well who I've fallen for, if you weren't too busy feeling sorry for yourself to notice.''"

[[File:Tonks Lupin.jpg|thumb|Nymphadora Tonks with husband, Remus Lupin]]
Remus's immediate response was a happiness he had never experienced in his life, but this was extinguished almost at once by a sense of crushing duty. He had always known that he could not marry and run the risk of passing on his painful, shameful condition. Wiser than Remus, she was sure that he loved her, but that he was refusing to admit it out of mistaken nobility. However, he avoided working with her, barely talked to her, and started volunteering for the most dangerous missions. Tonks became desperately unhappy, convinced not only that the man she loved would never willingly spend time with her again, but also that he might walk to his death rather than admit his feelings.

Inspired by [[Fleur Delacour]]'s protestation of enduring love for [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], who had been savaged by [[Fenrir Greyback|Greyback]], Tonks made a brave, public declaration of her feelings for Remus, who was forced to admit the strength of his love for her. In spite of continuing misgivings that he was acting selfishly, Remus married Tonks quietly in the north of Scotland, with witnesses taken from the local wizarding tavern. He continued to fear that the stigma attached to him would infect his wife and wished for no fanfare around their union. He swung constantly between elation that he was married to the woman of his dreams and terror of what he might have brought upon them both. When she became pregnant, Remus was not delighted by this, he was in fact scared that he might be passing his condition on to an innocent child. He even attempted to abandon his pregnant wife and unborn child, but was stopped by Harry Potter. Realising the importance of staying with his family above all else, he returned to Tonks, bitterly ashamed.

Lupin and Tonks were both murdered in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in May 1998, leaving their son behind in the care of his maternal grandmother, [[Andromeda Tonks]], and his godfather, Harry Potter. Teddy was raised by Andromeda, but would spend a great deal of time with the [[Potter family|Potter]] and [[Weasley family|Weasley]] families growing up. Teddy was a [[Metamorphmagus]], like his mother.

====Teddy Lupin====
{{Quote|Yes, yes, she's had the baby!|Remus joyfully announces the birth of his son|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Teddy Lupin.png|thumb|left|[[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]], his son and only child]]
Remus' son was born in [[1998]]. Remus and his wife named him Edward, Teddy for short, after her father [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]]. At one point, Remus nearly abandoned [[Nymphadora Tonks|his wife]] and unborn son, mostly out of premature shame, guilt, and the fear that his [[lycanthropy]] would be passed on and that he'd made outcasts out of Nymphadora and their child. Rather than wanting to face his impending fatherhood, he intended to help [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] with their mission of destroying Voldemort's Horcruxes (though he was actually unaware of what their "mission" entailed). Harry was, however, upset with the development and got into a rather heated argument with Remus that ultimately convinced him that the best course of action would be to support his family. He returned to his wife shortly thereafter.

Teddy was eventually born and despite his earlier fears and insecurities about being a father, Remus expressed joy at his son's birth and asked Harry to be Teddy's godfather. Sadly, Remus and his wife were murdered at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], leaving Teddy an orphan when he was between two weeks and one month old. When Remus appeared again through the [[Resurrection Stone]], he was rather devastated knowing that Teddy would have to grow up without either of his parents, but found some solace in knowing that Teddy would be living in a better world. Teddy was raised by his maternal grandmother, but he spent significant time with his [[Harry Potter|godfather]]'s family and the Weasleys.

===Marauders===
{{Quote|For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends... I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth...and they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.|Remus regarding his friends|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Marauders 1997.jpg|250px|thumb|Remus with his best friends; James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew]]
As a Hogwarts student, Remus became good friends with fellow [[Gryffindor]]s [[James Potter I|James Potter]], [[Sirius Black]], and [[Peter Pettigrew]]. In their second year, Remus' friends figured out that he was a [[werewolf]]; instead of shunning him, as many in the [[wizarding world]] would have, they learned how to become [[Animagus|Animagi]] by their fifth year to accompany Remus on his monthly transformations, preventing him from hurting himself.<ref name="POA" /> Because he was grateful to his friends, Remus cut them a lot of slack<ref name="JKR">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0626-alberthall-fry.htm 26 June 2003 Interview with J.K. Rowling at Royal Albert Hall]</ref>; despite being dismayed by their bullying of [[Severus Snape]], he did not attempt to stop them. Though he was his house's [[prefect]], Remus had difficulty trying to curb his friends' mischievous behaviour.<ref name="OTP" /> However, Remus was not without a mischief-making streak himself, contributing to the invention of the [[Marauder's Map]].

At some point, after Remus and his friends had all become members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], Sirius came to distrust Remus, fearing he might be a spy; the reasons for this are unknown. Sirius' distrust ensured that Remus was unaware when James and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]] changed their [[Secret Keeper|Secret-Keeper]] from Sirius to Peter, and thus he believed that Sirius had betrayed them when they were murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. The two reclaimed their friendship after Sirius [[Azkaban escapes#1993|escaped]] from [[Azkaban]] in [[1993]], and Remus learned the truth. They planned to kill their traitorous former friend Peter, but were stopped by [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="POA" /> Remus and Sirius both became close to their late friend's son, and Remus was devastated when Sirius was killed in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].<ref name="OTP" />

The ending of the three Marauders who had stayed true to their friendship to the very end — James, Sirius, and Remus — was bittersweet: they all lost their lives to the two wizarding wars but were likely reunited in the afterlife.

===Severus Snape===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Remus Lupin|It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.|Harry Potter|But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He says it himself. And you — do you honestly like Snape?|I neither like nor dislike Severus... We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon... I must be grateful.|Remus and [[Harry Potter]] on the former's relationship with Snape|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Severus Snape Profile.jpg|thumb|left|[[Severus Snape]], his former classmate and colleague]]
Severus Snape, a [[Slytherin]] student in Remus' year, shared a strong enmity with Remus' close friends [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and [[Sirius Black]], who outright bullied Snape on occasion. Although not friendly with Snape, Remus never behaved cruelly to him. It is possible that he may have subtly identified with or sympathised with the lonely, isolated Snape, seeing a reflection of himself and how he would have been treated if he hadn't found the protection of his friends. Later in life, he said that he deeply regretted not having done anything to stop the bullying.<ref name="OTP" />

At some point in their fifth year, Snape saw [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] leading Remus to the passageway on the full moon; Sirius thought it would be entertaining to inform Snape of how to freeze the [[Hogwarts Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]]. Snape tried to do so, but was stopped by James before he could reach the [[Shrieking Shack]], where Remus had transformed. [[Albus Dumbledore]] forbade Snape from revealing Remus' condition to anyone, and Snape deeply resented being put in James' debt and suspected that Remus might have been in on the dangerous prank.

As adults, Remus and Snape were civil to one another, although barely so on the latter's part. Remus claimed that he neither liked nor disliked Snape; of course they would never be bosom friends, after all that happened in their school days, but he also never forgot that Snape dutifully made him the Wolfsbane Potion, and made it perfectly every time so that he would not have to suffer at the full moon as he usually did. (Also, Snape secretly saved Lupin's life in [[Battle of the Seven Potters|Battle over Little Whinging]]). Snape, on the other hand, barely concealed his bitterness in their interactions. He was irked that Remus obtained the position of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]] at Hogwarts, which he had always wanted for himself. He suspected that Remus was helping Sirius get into the castle and tried to convince Dumbledore to stop trusting him. Snape also took to dropping hints that Remus was a werewolf to students, which was understood by at least one of them ([[Hermione Granger]], who kept the discovery to herself). When Remus tried to inform Snape of Sirius' innocence, Snape refused to hear or believe any of it, and was determined to see Remus punished alongside Sirius. When Snape's old enemy escaped re-capture, Snape vindictively exposed Remus' werewolf status, which forced him to resign.<ref name="POA" />

In spite of all this, Remus believed that Snape was loyal to the [[Order of the Phoenix]], encouraging [[Harry Potter]] to trust him and to continue his [[Occlumency]] lessons. He was shocked and angered when Snape killed [[Albus Dumbledore]], who had been the one to assure other Order members that Snape was trustworthy. During the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], Snape was one of the [[Death Eaters]] who attacked Remus and [[George Weasley]], the latter disguised as Harry by way of [[Polyjuice Potion]]. Snape, secretly still loyal to the Order, attempted to save Lupin by aiming a ''[[Sectumsempra]]'' at a Death Eater who was poised to kill Lupin, but accidentally struck George, who lost an ear. Remus, unusually furious, expressed a desire to have "<nowiki>''paid him back in kind''</nowiki>", but had to focus on getting himself and George to safety. Although Remus died before it was revealed that Snape was actually on his side the entire time, and had killed Dumbledore on his orders, it seems he found out afterwards and forgave him as he seemed to understand why Harry was walking to his death in the forest.<ref name="DH" />

===Lily Evans===
{{Quote|Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.|Remus explaining to [[Harry Potter]] that he was friends with Lily|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Lily_Potter1.jpg|thumb|[[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], his friend and mother of Harry [[Harry Potter|Potter]]]]
Remus met Lily Evans while they were both attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Lily was not on good terms with two of Remus' dearest friends, James and Sirius, but that did not mean she disliked Remus as well, given that he acted more mature and thoughtful than his friends, and did not participate in their bullying though he did nothing to stop them either. 

After Hogwarts, Lily married [[James Potter I|James Potter]]. Although Sirius was the best man, Remus probably attended their wedding, too, given his status as one of their dearest friends. They all became members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], during the [[First Wizarding War]], and fought in several battles together. When Pettigrew betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, resulting in the tragic deaths of James and Lily, Remus was devastated. Later on, he became close to Lily's son, Harry, both as a paternal figure and a mentor. After Lupin was murdered during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], they were two of the four spirits whom Harry summoned using the Resurrection Stone.

===Harry Potter===
{{Quote|Molly, you're not the only person at this table who cares about Harry.|Remus regarding his feelings toward Harry|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Harry_Potter_movies_hbp_promostills_6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]]: former student, good friend, and godfather to his son]]
Remus met Harry Potter, the son of his late friends [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]], for the first time since he was an infant, in [[1993]] when he saved Harry from [[Dementor]]s on the Hogwarts Express. Remus was the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] during Harry's third year, and quickly became his favourite professor. The two bonded very closely. Remus found Harry to be; intelligent, kind, and an excellent Seeker, and had strong empathy for the pain that he had experienced throughout his life. Seeing him as the devoted, informative, fair and supportive man he is, Harry admired and cared about Remus even after he found out that he was a werewolf.

{{Quote|If I'm proud of anything I've done this year, it's how much you've learned... Tell me about your Patronus.|Lupin's immense pride in Harry|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
Remus also told Harry that the first time he saw him, he recognised him not by [[Harry Potter's scars#The lightning-bolt scar|his scar]], but by his eyes, which so closely resembled Lily's; unlike his predecessors [[Quirinus Quirrell]] and [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], Remus did not greet Harry in an awed manner at meeting a living legend, but in a friendly and casual manner. It is suggested that Remus' classes were how Harry discovered his remarkable talent for Defence Against the Dark Arts. He took Harry aside to teach him the [[Patronus Charm]], assisted him in avoiding trouble with [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], and returned the [[Marauder's Map]] to him once he was no longer a professor.<ref name="POA" />

The two met again in the summer of [[1995]]. Remus was part of [[Advance Guard|the group]] of [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]] members who transported Harry from Privet Drive to [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. Throughout the years, Remus shared with Harry many stories about his parents and [[Sirius Black|godfather]]. He comforted Harry over Sirius' death and also offered him advice on other occasions.<ref name="OTP" />

{{Dialogue a-b-a|Harry Potter|Just — just to be clear. You want to leave Tonks at her parents' house and come away with us?|Remus|She'll be perfectly safe there, they'll look after her. Harry, I'm sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.|Well. I'm not. I'm pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren't sticking with your own kid, actually.|Harry and Remus first and only argument|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:250px-Dementor_Boggart.gif|250px|thumb|Remus Lupin protecting Harry Potter when Harry's [[boggart]] turns into a [[Dementor]] in [[1993]]]]
The only real disagreement they ever had was when Harry rejected Remus' offer to accompany him and his friends on the quest for Horcruxes. Harry became angry and cutting; he told his former teacher that he was being selfish and irresponsible for leaving his wife and unborn child. Remus responded with uncharacteristic violence and stormed out of the house, taking refuge in a corner of the Leaky Cauldron, where he sat drinking and fuming. However, after a few hours' reflection, Remus was forced to accept that his former-pupil had just taught him a valuable lesson. James and Lily, Remus reflected, had stuck with Harry even unto their own deaths. His own parents had sacrificed their peace and security to keep the family together. When Remus' son [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]] was born, he asked that Harry be the boy's godfather, and after Remus' death, Harry played a prominent role in Teddy's life. Remus was one of the spirits that came out of the [[Resurrection Stone]] to speak to Harry as he walked to what he believed was his death, indicating the almost familial bond between Remus and Harry.<ref name="DH" /> This familial bond can be compared to wolf behaviour, as it is common in wolf packs for the pups to be looked after by all members of the pack, much like how Harry was looked after and tutored by his father's friends, who in a way were part of James' "pack". 

In {{FB}}, Harry wrote in the werewolf section "''aren't all bad''", showing that Remus being a werewolf did not bother him at all.

===Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley===
{{Dialogue a-b |Hermione Granger|Harry! How could you?|Ron Weasley|You shouldn't have said that stuff to Lupin.|Hermione and Ron after [[Harry Potter|Harry]] yells at Remus for leaving [[Nymphadora Tonks|his wife]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:The-trio-Harry-Potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-potterhead-29266030-365-400.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]], his former students]]
Hermione Granger and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] were among the students who were very impressed by Remus' teaching when he was professor of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] for their third year. Hermione deduced that Remus was a [[werewolf]] (which was the actual goal of Severus Snape when he taught a lesson about werevolves as Lupin's substitute) early in the year, but kept this discovery to herself, not even telling her best friends; this is likely because she disapproved of the prejudice against werewolves and knew exposing the truth would hurt Remus. Although Ron initially reacted with fear to the revelation that Remus was a werewolf, he continued to admire and like Remus. In turn, Remus was fond of Ron and Hermione, and was particularly impressed by the latter's cleverness.<ref name="POA" /> Ron and Hermione were shown to be very trusting of Lupin; when he appeared at Grimmauld Place, they lowered their wands as soon as he declared his name, something he reproached them for, "''speaking as their former [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher''." Also, they both disapproved when Harry yelled at Remus for leaving [[Nymphadora Tonks|his wife]] during her pregnancy, although they did not entirely disagree with Harry's reasoning.<ref name="DH" />

===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Quote|On a happier note, [[Albus Dumbledore|I]] am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks [[1993–1994 school year|this year]]. Firstly, Professor Lupin who had kindly consented to fill the post of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher.|Albus Dumbledore introduces Remus|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|thumb|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his former employer and friend]]
Albus Dumbledore was considered by many to be the greatest [[Wizardkind|wizard]] of all time, and Remus Lupin was among his many admirers and staunch supporters. Dumbledore was Remus' Headmaster during his time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Dumbledore accepted Remus into his school, despite knowing his being a werewolf, as he valued Remus' strength of character and ability, and disregarded the stigma associated with his condition; the [[headmaster]] personally approached the Lupin family to invite Remus to school, knowing full well of the circumstances. In fact, it was Dumbledore who, by several special precautions, ensured that Remus' werewolf status was kept secret during his school years, effectively preventing him from being ostracised from his school mates. 

{{Quote|I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course... he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally.|Lupin's respect for Dumbledore|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
When [[Severus Snape]] found out what Remus truly was due to a cruel prank played on him by [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], Dumbledore was the one who swore him to secrecy. On his part, Remus confessed that Dumbledore's trust and exceptional kindness towards him meant everything to him, given that the vast majority of the wizarding world shunned him because of the deep prejudice towards werewolves, and Remus felt guilty for betraying this kindness by allowing his three [[Marauders|Marauder]] friends illegally become [[Animagus|Animagi]] and roaming wild during their schooling years. Despite this, after learning of Sirius's innocence, Dumbledore forgave Remus for his supposed betrayal, understanding his Marauder friends only became Animagi to help Remus in his werewolf form and considered it an extraordinary achievement.

{{Dialogue a-b|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] — Dumbledore's dead.|Remus Lupin|No!|Lupin's loss of control after being informed of Dumbledore's death|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Dumbledore was also the founder and leader of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation that Remus joined after graduating from school, and he was trusted with many important missions. Remus was given the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts during the 1993–1994 school year, during which time Dumbledore requested that Snape brew the [[Wolfsbane Potion]] for Remus monthly; this, along with providing Remus with a paid job when he was suffering in poverty due to his condition, made Remus respect Dumbledore even more. Remus and Dumbledore fought alongside one another during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], where they suffered a devastating loss: Sirius, one of their dearest friends, died at the hands of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Remus told Harry Potter on several occasions that he trusted Snape because Dumbledore did so. In 1997, Remus was devastated by Dumbledore's [[death]] after the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], and demonstrated his loyalty and faith to Dumbledore by fighting and where he was assassinated by Antonin Dolohov a very powerful wizard he was avenged by Professor Filius Flitwick, his former teacher.

===Weasley family===
[[File:Weasley_family_studio_01.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Weasley family]]]]
Remus was always friendly with the Weasley family. He knew [[Arthur Weasley]] since the [[First Wizarding War]], and they became friends again after Dumbledore led the second [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Arthur and Remus fought together at the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], where the latter was paired with Arthur's son, [[George Weasley|George]]. He saved George's life, as George would have fallen off his broomstick when he was cursed by [[Severus Snape]]. Arthur later thanked him for taking care of his son.

Remus also lived for some time with the Weasley family at [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. There, Remus agreed with [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] not to tell Harry much about the Order of the Phoenix and Voldemort's plans. However, when Sirius argued with Molly, Remus didn't take either side.

[[William Weasley|Bill]] and Remus seemed to have been friends, as they fought together in several battles of the Second War; they were also the ones who attempted to find [[Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye]]'s dead body after the Battle of the Seven Potters. After the war, Remus and Tonks' [[Edward Lupin|son]] seemed to have a romantic relationship with Bill and Fleur's [[Victoire Weasley|daughter]].

Fred and George Weasley were also friends of Lupin. They were Lupin's students during their fifth year at Hogwarts and they also fought together at the Battle of the Seven Potters. Remus protected George from being killed; however, George's ear was accidentally cut off by [[Severus Snape]]. Lupin and the twins also appeared on the underground radio programme ''[[Potterwatch]]'' and spoke to the wizarding community during the last year of the war. Both Fred and Lupin were killed during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

He was also friends with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. He first met her at [[Hogwarts Express]], saved her from the [[Dementor]]s and gave her chocolate and comforted her, and she stated that he was one of her favourite professors at Hogwarts. They fought on the same side at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and survived the battle. After the war, Ginny and the rest of the Potter family shared a close relationship with Teddy Lupin, who came to Ginny and Harry's house for dinner four times a week.

His relationship with [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] was almost unknown. When Lupin was Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Percy most likely thought he was a good teacher. They met each other again during the Battle of Hogwarts, when Percy told his family that he had left the Ministry and wanted to join the Order, though there would hardly have been time for the two to become close.

===Hogwarts residents===

He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I'm trustworthy —|How Lupin gained acceptance as a Hogwarts teacher|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:600full-harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|thumb| [[Minerva McGonagall]], his former head of house and professor]]
When Lupin was a student at Hogwarts, the professors seemed to like him, especially Minerva McGonagall, who had been his head of house. His professors probably considered Lupin a skilled wizard and a very good student, as he was made a [[prefect]] in his fifth year.

When Lupin became a professor, the other professors appeared to like and respect him, with the exception of [[Severus Snape]]. They either did not mind that he was a werewolf or did not show it, as they had been informed of his condition. Minerva even made reference to Lupin's evaluations on Harry's Defence Against the Dark Arts skills during a Careers Advice session. Many of them later fought alongside Remus at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

Many of the students, including [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Dean Thomas]], and the Weasleys liked him. While others, such as [[Draco Malfoy]] and several other [[Slytherin]]s, disliked and regularly insulted him. Malfoy underestimated Lupin because of his poor-looking appearance. However, Lupin managed to be well-respected (and one of the best-liked professors), as he treated all the students based on their character, and not by their magical abilities, their blood status, or their wealth. When he left Hogwarts, many students continued to regard him as the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher they had.

===Order of the Phoenix===
[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250px|thumb|left|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]
Remus had a good relationship with the most of the Order of the Phoenix. In addition to [[Albus Dumbledore]], [[Harry Potter]], the [[Marauders]], [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Hermione Granger]], the [[Weasley family]], and [[Minerva McGonagall]], he was friends with many of members.

One of his friends through the order was [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]. They fought together in several battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]], and appeared to be close enough. They also appeared on ''[[Potterwatch]]'' together during the last year of the war.

He was also a friend of [[Alastor Moody]]. They fought together in many battles, until Moody was killed by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] in [[1997]], during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. Remus was devastated, as were many other members of the Order.

Remus was one of the many members of the Order of the Phoenix murdered during Second Wizarding War.

==Etymology==

*The name "Remus" comes from the brothers Romulus and Remus, the legendary brothers who fought to the death over the control of Rome, having been raised by a mother wolf whose cubs had died. Because of this, some fans speculated that Remus had a brother, but "Romulus" is merely the code name used by Lupin for ''[[Potterwatch]]''. Remus' intense rivalry with Romulus indicates Lupin's ongoing struggle with his other side, the werewolf.
*"Lupin" is derived from "lupinus", Latin for "wolf-like"; "lupus", or "wolf", being the basic word. ''Canis l​upus'' is the scientific name for the wolf - to be described as "lupine" means to "resemble a wolf." Lupin is also the name of an plant with edible seeds. The surname may also be derived from the character of Arsène Lupin, a fictional gentleman thief and master of disguise, who was created by French writer Maurice Leblanc in 1905. In Leblanc's novels, Arsène Lupin is often a force for good, while operating on the wrong side of the law. Leblanc's Lupin was said to have later inspired the character of "the Lone Wolf", a jewel thief-turned-private detective in a series of novels written by Louis Joseph Vance, beginning in 1914.

*Remus Lupin being a werewolf could have been predicted merely by his name. Remus is from a roman story about two demigod/prince brothers, '''Remus''' and, the founder of Rome, Romulus, who were raised by a '''wolf'''. Lupin is a take on the Latin word for wolf, ''lupus''.
*Remus Lupin is unique among the teachers as he calls students per their first names, not surnames. The only other teachers that are known to do this is the [[Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore]] and the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] [[Rubeus Hagrid|professor]].
*Remus Lupin is the only [[Marauders|Marauder]] to be on anything resembling civil terms with [[Severus Snape]] as adults. [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and Snape had often argued as adults. [[Peter Pettigrew|Pettigrew]] was treated with contempt by Snape, going so far into being treated as a house servant at Snape's personal residence at [[Spinner's End]].
*With his marriage to [[Nymphadora Tonks]], Remus became related through his wife to the Malfoys, the Blacks, the Lestranges, the Weasleys, the Potters, the Longbottoms, and other pure-blood families.<ref>[[House of Black|Black family tree]]</ref>
*The Marauders write their names on the Marauder's Map in this order: Remus, Peter, Sirius and James. Ironically, this, when reversed, is the order in which they die, James being the first in [[1981]], [[Godric's Hollow]]; Sirius in [[1996]], [[Department of Mysteries]]; Peter in [[March]] [[1998]], [[Malfoy Manor]]; Remus in [[May]] [[1998]], [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].
**Remus survived the longest out of all the Marauders, beating Wormtail by some chapters in {{DH}}.
*After the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], 13 people (Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill, Fleur, Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, Harry, Hermione, Remus, Tonks and Hagrid) gathered in [[The Burrow]] to mourn the death of [[Alastor Moody]]. Afterwards, Remus stood up and offered to look for Moody's dead body. Later in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Remus was killed by [[Antonin Dolohov]] thus making another of [[Sybill Trelawney|Trelawney]]'s predictions come true for the third time (first time on [[Albus Dumbledore]], and second on [[Sirius Black]]) : that ''when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die''. However, as it is not known when Remus died, it is possible that Fred died before him.
*[[J. K. Rowling]] wrote a full-length biography of Remus for ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' on {{PM}}, which was released in the final instalment of the book, and provided information on his and [[Nymphadora Tonks]]'s relationship, as well as his youth.<ref name="IN">See [http://insider.pottermore.com/2013/07/red-caps-are-most-complicated.html this interview] on the ''Pottermore Insider''</ref>
*Remus is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[David Thewlis]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]''.
**Thewlis had originally auditioned for the part of [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirinus Quirrell]], but [[Ian Hart]] was eventually cast.
**David Thewlis has said that ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' director [[Alfonso Cuarón|Alfonso Cuaron]] told him to portray Remus as a "gay junkie".<ref>http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/04/every-so-often-remus-lupin-is-gay</ref>
*In the books, Remus plays a relatively large part in Harry's life after he left Hogwarts as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. However, in the films, Remus plays a large part in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', and then his role is drastically reduced. His argument and brief falling out with Harry in ''Deathly Hallows'' is cut out, as is his bitterness at being a father. The audience is not made aware of Remus' child until a throwaway line in ''Deathly Hallows: Part 2''. ''Half-Blood Prince'' also cuts down his role, eliminating Remus' concerns about being in a relationship with Tonks.
**David Thewlis was disappointed about his smaller appearances in the films, expressing a desire to be more involved.
*Originally, Remus and Nymphadora were supposed to survive the Battle of Hogwarts, but Rowling eventually killed them off as compensation after sparing [[Arthur Weasley]] from the death, as he was originally intended to die in either the fifth book or the seventh book.
*The [[Trolley witch|witch who pushes the lunch trolley]], Remus, and [[Horace Slughorn]] are the only adults ever to be seen travelling to Hogwarts on the [[Hogwarts Express|school train]] in the book [[Harry Potter (book series)|series]] (the latter is never shown on the train in the films). Though the [[Hogwarts Express conductor|conductor]] is never shown in the books, he is seen in some of the video game adaptations.
*It was predicted by many fans that Wormtail would kill Remus with his silver hand, as Remus is a werewolf. However, J.K. Rowling mentioned in an interview that, contrary to what is seen in films, in her view werewolves are not affected by silver. Ironically the Marauder that does die by the silver hand is not Lupin, but Wormtail himself.
*In {{HBP|FA}}, Remus and Nymphadora were already in a relationship, rather then Remus initially rejecting her feelings since during the Christmas scene at [[The Burrow]] she calls him "sweetheart".
*In an earlier draft of {{POA}}, the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class may have been taught by a woman.<ref>[http://www.hplex.info/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-trans-jottings1.html HP Lexicon's transcript of JKR's notes]</ref>
*His name is the inspiration for the [[wizard rock]] bands [[Remus and the Lupins]] and [[The Remus Lupins]].
*According to StarDate Online's Moon Phase Calculator, Remus' birth date (10 March, 1960), fell two days before a full moon.
*Although Remus provides most of the books' information on the Patronus Charm, his own Patronus was never revealed in any of the books or media associated with the franchise until the release of the final chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' on {{PM}}. His corporeal Patronus takes the form of a [[wolf]], rather than a werewolf. Despite this, he normally preferred to purposely cast it as a non-corporeal form, as he considered the corporeal form to be too much of a giveaway.<ref name="PM" />
*J. K. Rowling has indirectly stated that, if Remus Lupin were to take a {{w|Myers–Briggs Type Indicator}} assessment, his personality type would be {{w|ENFJ}}.<ref>[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/580047164807749632 .@LokiLockedLupin Er - no.  They've got Lupin and Dumbledore the wrong way round for starters.] by [https://twitter.com/jk_rowling J. K. Rowling on Twitter]</ref>
*The irony of his status as a werewolf and his desire to be liked and belong is that wolves are social animals that tend to live in packs and act in the interests of all, reflecting his selfless and self-sacrificing nature. This, combined with the typically savage side of his werewolf forms presents an almost yin-yang-like inner conflict, with his human form representing the better half of his wolfish personality, such as his intelligence, kindness, adaptability, and desire to defend. All the while his werewolf form represents the more savage aspects of wolves, such as feral wrath, gluttony, and lust.
**Another bit of irony is in his love of chocolate, as it is poisonous to wolves and other canines.
*In the films Remus is shown to be a fan of jazz music, and owns an antique record player.
*Remus' tendency to nurture those around him, particularly children, is fitting, as wolves' social structure commonly involves all members of the pack looking after and teaching the pups. Yet another instance where Remus lives up to the nobler aspects of his wolfish nature. Rather ironically, he considered himself unfit for parenthood, though this was largely influenced by his fears that any children may inherit his affliction. Despite this, his son, [[Edward Lupin|Teddy]], did not.
*Lupin was Harry's only Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who was not antagonistic to him. (Not including when Lupin tried attacking him in his werewolf form).
*Remus is also Harry's first Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher not to have been a [[Ravenclaw]] when he was attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].
*{{W|Robin Williams}} was interested in playing a few different [[Harry Potter universe|Harry Potter]] characters, the biggest one being Lupin. However, given the strict rule of only British and Irish casting for main characters, he was rejected for all roles.<ref name="robinwilliams">[https://www.insider.com/harry-potter-director-robin-williams-different-interpretation-lupin-2021-11/ 'Harry Potter' director says if Robin Williams had been able to play Lupin, he would've had a completely 'different interpretation' of the role]</ref>
**[[Chris Columbus]] thought he would have made a "brilliant" Lupin, if David Thewlis was not cast.<ref name="robinwilliams"/>

===Author's comments===
[[J. K. Rowling]] has stated that Professor Lupin is the kind of teacher she wishes she had while she was a student. He is good-natured, kind, and able to extract the best in everyone — for example, in spotting [[Neville Longbottom]]'s lack of confidence and helping him to overcome it by teaching him how to defeat the [[boggart]].

The fact that Remus is a [[werewolf]] and needs to take a [[Wolfsbane Potion|potion]] to avoid hurting people for the rest of his life makes him a symbol of the consequences of prejudice and segregation, as well as society's often negative reaction to the ill and the disabled. Particularly, the author has stated that Remus Lupin's characterisation and history are H.I.V. metaphors (e.g. someone who was infected young and suffered prejudice because of it; terrified of passing the condition on), as well as an exploration into why someone might become embittered as a result of contracting such a condition.<ref name="legal">[http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/system/files/Trial+Transcript+Day+1.txt Court record of the legal dispute between J.K. Rowling and HP lexicon over the proposed publication by the latter of an unauthorised and unofficial Harry Potter encyclopaedia]</ref>

As such, Rowling has also stated that "Lupin's failing is he likes to be liked. That's where he slips up — he's been disliked so often he's always pleased to have friends so cuts them an awful lot of slack."<ref name="JKR" /> This is why, for instance, despite disapproving of his friends' bullying of [[Severus Snape]], he once tried to stop them but failed and never tried again.

Lupin was killed off in place of Arthur Weasley to remove the last of Harry's father figures in the books, and also to create a parallel between Harry's life and Teddy Lupin's. Rowling felt it was important to show the evils of Voldemort's actions and the devastating nature of war.<ref>[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/20026225/ns/today-wild_about_harry MSNBC interview]</ref> She says she only decided to kill Remus at the end of the fifth book.

Rowling has said that Remus is one of her favourite characters, and that if she could meet any of her characters, she would likely choose him.<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0804-ebf.htm 15 August 2004 Edinburgh Book Festival with J.K. Rowling]</ref>
