{{Quote|That’s Edgar Bones... brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his family too, he was a great wizard...|[[Alastor Moody]]'s opinion of Edgar|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Edgar Bones''' (d. [[1981]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], son of [[Amelia Bones' father|Mr]] and [[Amelia Bones' mother|Mrs Bones]], brother of [[Amelia Bones|Amelia]] and at least one other person. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was possibly sorted into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]].

Edgar became a member of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]] and fought in the [[First Wizarding War]]. At some point he married a [[Edgar Bones's wife|woman]] and had several [[Edgar Bones's children|children]]. According to [[Alastor Moody]] Edgar was a "''great wizard''". He and his family were murdered by [[Death Eaters]] before the war's end.

==Biography==
{{Quote|No one lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some of the best witches and wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts —|The numerous wizards murdered during the first war|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}Edgar was born into a [[Bones family|wizarding family]] and had a sister, [[Amelia Bones|Amelia]]. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he was possibly sorted into [[Hufflepuff]] house. Edgar and Amelia also had at least one other sibling, the parent of their niece [[Susan Bones|Susan]].

During the [[First Wizarding War]], Edgar Bones became member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation led and founded by [[Albus Dumbledore]], in order to oppose the [[Tom Riddle|Dark Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. Edgar also married a [[Edgar Bones's wife|woman]] and had [[Edgar Bones's children|more than one child]] with her. Edgar was also described as being a great wizard by [[Alastor Moody]]. [[Rubeus Hagrid]] also told [[Harry Potter]] that the [[Bones family]] was considered among the greatest wizards of all time.

Edgar was murdered, along with his [[Edgar Bones's wife|wife]] and [[Edgar Bones's children|children]], by [[Death Eaters]] sometime in the later half of 1981. His [[Amelia Bones' mother|mother]] and [[Amelia Bones' father|father]] were also murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]].

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': Considered to be an exceptionally talented wizard by both [[Alastor Moody]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]], it is highly likely that Edgar was one of the most powerful wizards in the [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]].

==Etymology==
The name "Edgar" is derived from the Old English elements ''ead'' "rich, blessed" and ''gar'' "spear". This was the name of a 10th-century English king who is regarded as a saint. The name did not survive long after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 18th century, in part due to a character by this name in Sir Walter Scott's novel 'The Bride of Lammermoor' (1819).

==Behind the scenes==
*Edgar Bones was portrayed by First Assistant Director [[Cliff Lanning]] in {{OOTP|FA}}. He only appeared in the photograph of the Order of the Phoenix.
