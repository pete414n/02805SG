'''Ritchie Coote''' (fl. [[1985]]-[[1997]]) was a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the 1990s. He was chosen by [[Harry Potter]] to be one of the new [[Beater]]s for the [[1996–1997 school year|1996-1997]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. Together with [[Jimmy Peakes]], he replaced [[Jack Sloper]] and [[Andrew Kirke]].



Early years
Ritchie was educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and apon his arrival was sorted into the [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. Ritchie was a fair player at [[Quidditch]] and played best in the position of Beater. Ritchie had not tried out for the [[Quidditch team]] as there was few open positions.
1996-1997 school year


In 1996, after the departure of Fred and George Weasley, Ritchie Coote along with [[Jimmy Peakes]] replaced them as the new beaters for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. According to [[Harry Potter]], neither of the two lived up to the shadow that the Weasley twins had left them, but they played well enough and managed to stay on the team throughout the 1996-1997 [[Quidditch]] season.

It was mentioned by [[Hermione Granger]] that he and [[Jimmy Peakes|Peakes]] apparently caught Harry after he was knocked out by a Bludger to the head that [[Cormac McLaggen]] accidently hit him with. At the end of this year, Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] was murdered by [[Severus Snape]].

1997-1998 school year
Not being in [[Harry Potter]]'s year and the 1997–1998 school year being Harry's final year of education meant that Ritchie would also be returning to continue his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in 1997 after the death of former Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]]. With Dumbledore dead the school was to be taken over by [[Minerva McGonagall]] but with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s rise to power [[Severus Snape]] took to the position.

Battle of Hogwarts
In last few months of the school year, the [[Second Wizarding War]] came to a close with the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Lord Voldemort and his [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] army invaded the castle and a battle broke out to defend it and protect [[Harry Potter]]. The castle was almost completely destroyed and there were many casualties. It is unknown if Ritchie was present for the battle or if he was too young to stay in combat.


It was said that Coote did not have the "old brilliance" of Fred and George (whom he and fellow new Beater Jimmy Peakes replaced) and he "looked weedy", but he did aim well.


*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Coote was shown to be a skilled [[Quidditch]] player, as he was chosen to play as [[Beater]] on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] in [[1996]]. He was said to aim well whilst playing.


Taken from pety coote, "a small coat," from petty + coat. Originally a padded coat worn by men under armour. May reference to the character's place originally being filled by Fred/George Weasley and now filled by a new man in armour (Quidditch Uniform).
