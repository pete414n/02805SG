The '''cook''' working at [[The Hanged Man]] was a resident of [[Little Hangleton]] in [[1943]]. When all three [[Riddle family|Riddles]] living in the area were murdered in their own [[Riddle House|house]], and [[Frank Bryce]] was framed for the murder (the real murderer being [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]) the townsfolk gossiped about it all around town. That night, many residents converged at the Hanged Man, the local tavern, to voice their opinions, the cook being one of them. He, like the rest, believed Frank had committed the murder.


*His statement about knowing of a key hanging in Frank's shed implies that he had visited the place at least once.
