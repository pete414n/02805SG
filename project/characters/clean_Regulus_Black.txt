'''Regulus Arcturus''' '''Black''' ([[1961]] – [[1979]]) was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], born to [[Orion Black|Orion]] and [[Walburga Black]], and the younger brother of [[Sirius Black]]. He was a member of the noble [[House of Black]], an old wizarding family which probably started around the Middle Ages.

He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1972]] and was sorted into the [[Slytherin]] house. Regulus became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] in his youth, but defected when he found what [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] would do in order to reach his aims. Regulus also learned about [[Slytherin's Locket|one of]] Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es and decided to destroy it. He was killed after acquiring [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s [[Slytherin's Locket|locket]] in [[1979]].

Regulus was born in 1961 into the wealthy, pure-blooded [[House of Black|Black family]], as the youngest son of Orion and Walburga Black and younger brother of Sirius Black. It is assumed that he was named after his great-uncle, also named [[Regulus Black I|Regulus]], and his paternal grandfather, [[Arcturus Black III|Arcturus]]. Relatives included [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], a loyal [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s, [[Andromeda Tonks]], who married a [[Muggle-born]] and was subsequently disowned by the family, and [[Narcissa Malfoy]], who married Death Eater [[Lucius Malfoy]].

Regulus' parents considered him to be much different from his older brother Sirius Black. Although Sirius was the older son and heir, he didn't in any way whatsoever follow the [[House of Black|Black family]] traditions, unlike Regulus. Their parents disapproved of this, and Sirius was later sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house when he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], causing an even bigger strain on his relationship with the rest of the family. 

Following this, Sirius left home at the age of sixteen and was subsequently disowned and burned from the family tapestry by his parents like Andromeda Tonks a few years before. Regulus, on the other hand, was admired by his parents for his loyalty towards his family and upholding their traditions.

Regulus, unlike Sirius, was sorted into [[Slytherin]], and became a member of his house [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch team|team]]. Harry Potter discovered a photograph of Regulus' team years later, which suggested that he played as [[Seeker]], based on the seating. He attended Hogwarts from about [[1972]] to [[1979]].




From a young age, Regulus admired Lord Voldemort and had an ambition to become a Death Eater later on in his life. Regulus had photos and articles about the Dark Lord and his followers cut from the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', which were hung in his bedroom near a painting of his family crest. Regulus received his [[Dark Mark]] around the age of sixteen, which his family approved of as Voldemort was seen as striving to achieve [[pure-blood]] supremacy over other wizards and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s. Even though his parents were never [[Death Eaters]] themselves, they agreed with many of Lord Voldemort's own beliefs.

After becoming a Death Eater, Regulus began to consider abandoning Lord Voldemort, partly because his master mistreated and intended to kill the Black family's loyal [[house-elf]] [[Kreacher]], whilst setting up the security measures for [[Slytherin's Locket|one of his Horcruxes]].






By [[1979]], Regulus had begun to have doubts about serving as a Death Eater, but was reluctant to act against the [[Death Eaters]] and Voldemort. One day, Voldemort asked Regulus for the use of his house-elf, Kreacher and Regulus eagerly accepted as he wanted to please his master. Voldemort used Kreacher to test the defences around his [[Slytherin's Locket|locket Horcrux]], leaving him to die afterwards. Kreacher was able to escape using house-elf magic, and told Regulus of what had happened. Regulus worked out that the locket was a Horcrux and was the reason behind Voldemort's [[immortality]].

This was the deciding factor in Regulus' defection. He created a duplicate of the locket and placed a note inside for Voldemort to find, expecting him to check on the Horcrux in the future, and then ordered Kreacher to take him to where the real locket was hidden. Kreacher guided Regulus past the cave's defences. At the island with the basin of [[Emerald Potion|potion]] containing the locket, Regulus ordered Kreacher to take the locket once the potion was gone and replace it with the [[Regulus Black's locket|fake one]], then escape without him and find a way to destroy the Horcrux. Regulus drank the potion himself, and when he tried to get water from the lake to quench his thirst, he was dragged to his death by the [[Inferius|Inferi]]. Kreacher obeyed his master's final order and switched the lockets before escaping. However, despite his best efforts, he was unable to destroy the Horcrux.

Regulus's father, [[Orion Black|Orion]], also died sometime in 1979.

The true circumstances of Regulus's death were entirely unknown to the members of his family, as he had asked Kreacher to keep the events at the cave a secret, due to this being safer for the family. Sirius Black, not knowing the truth of the matter, came to believe that Regulus had simply gotten in too far and was killed for trying to back out of being a Death Eater. Remus Lupin believed that Regulus had tried to back out of being a Death Eater, commenting that he thought Regulus had lasted "a few days" after his defection before he had been killed. 

In [[1997]], Kreacher told Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] of Regulus' attempt to destroy the Horcrux, having been there himself, as the trio also sought to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. They then realised that Regulus was ''R.A.B.'' that was signed on the note to Lord Voldemort. Following this, Harry gave Kreacher the counterfeit locket that Regulus had replaced the real one with, showing Harry's own respect for the house-elf. Kreacher later earned this respect by subsequently showing more respect towards Harry, Ron and Hermione. The real locket was later destroyed by Ron Weasley with [[Sword of Gryffindor|Gryffindor's Sword]], finally accomplishing what Regulus had set out to do.

During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Kreacher, having rallied many of the school's house-elves to assist him, ordered them to fight for Regulus while wielding knives against the Death Eaters' knees and shins.



Regulus has been known to have resembled his older brother, with the black hair and haughty good looks common to their family history. Harry Potter made an opinion that Regulus was "smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been." As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm.



Regulus, having been sorted into Slytherin house, was eager to show similarity with his parents, unlike Sirius, who would rather show difference. Regulus' parents had a preference of pure-blooded wizards, so it is assumed that Regulus took after them whilst growing up. Regulus' room was full of Slytherin banners, unlike Sirius, whose room was full of [[Gryffindor]]'s. Harry at one point compared the sign on Regulus's bedroom door to something that [[Percy Weasley]] would write suggesting some similarities in personality, namely haughtiness and pompousness.

Regulus, like his parents, admired [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and believed that he was a great [[Dark Wizard]]. However, after he became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], he realised how desperate his master was to reach his goals, showing that Regulus had higher morals in spite of his general beliefs. Regulus later discovered the Dark Lord's creation of at least one [[Horcrux]], and the reason for his immortality. Having turned against his master, he decided to destroy the locket while sacrificing himself in the process, which showed both his bravery and selflessness as well. He also commanded Kreacher (his family house-elf) not to tell his family what had happened in order to ensure their safety. This showed how much he cared for Kreacher and his family including Sirius, in spite of their estrangement, while further exemplifying how willing he was to sacrifice himself for people he cared about. Regulus also respected [[Kreacher]] as well, and was among those of many who believed that Voldemort would be destroyed by the [[Harry Potter|Chosen One]].

Despite hailing from a noble wizarding family, Sirius himself doubted Regulus was ever exemplary enough to be personally killed by Voldemort, showing just how high the barring standards that Death Eaters have for their membership.


*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Regulus played as [[Seeker]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] during his time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], meaning he was a highly accomplished and skilled [[broomstick]] flyer and very gifted at [[Quidditch]], or at least so in his youth. 
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a former [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], Regulus would have been proficient and accomplished with dark magic. Regulus also had excellent and esoteric knowledge of highly advanced dark magic, as he was intelligent and knowledgeable enough to know what [[Horcrux]]es are, dark arts of the highest and most depraved levels that only very few would ever know, and even deduced that [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] made one, when no other Death Eaters knew. He also managed to slip past the defences that Voldemort placed on the [[Slytherin's Locket|locket]] and managed to retrieve it in [[the Cave]], though at the cost of his own life at the hands of Voldemort's [[Inferius|Inferi]] in the cave's [[water]]s.



, his older brother|alt]]
Regulus and his parents, [[Orion Black|Orion]] and [[Walburga Black|Walburga]], had a good relationship. Because his brother, Sirius, didn't share his parents' ideology, their parents told Sirius that "Regulus was a better son than him". Regulus' parents were very glad that their son was sorted into [[Slytherin]] house and that he became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] after leaving [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] despite not being Death Eaters themselves. However, Regulus' parents were shocked when they learned what [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] would do to achieve his aims.

Regulus and his older brother [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] didn't have a good relationship after their respective Sortings, in part because Sirius was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house. Sirius also disliked Regulus because of his ambition to become a Death Eater, but he was unaware that Regulus later attempted to destroy one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Sirius regretted how young his brother died, and wished Regulus hadn't been as soft to go with what their parents told him to do. Sirius originally speaks of his younger brother with derision though his feelings are later softened.

Regulus' relationship with other family members, such as his cousins [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]], is unknown. It is likely that he got along well with Bellatrix and Narcissa, since they all supported pure-blood supremacy and were involved with the Death Eaters. It is possible that he and Andromeda weren't close, because the latter was considered a [[blood traitor]] for marrying [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]], a [[Muggle-born]]. She was also removed from the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]]. However, Bellatrix was a fanatically loyal [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who would die for [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. She was also among Voldemort's most sadistic followers.



, his former master|alt]]
Regulus admired [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] from an early age, having the same ideology as the Dark Lord. Voldemort thought Regulus was a loyal servant, as he trusted him enough to ask Regulus to lend him [[Kreacher]], his [[house-elf]]. Voldemort wanted to test his magical protections, and went with Kreacher to [[the Cave]]. When Voldemort ordered Kreacher to drink a [[Emerald Potion|potion]], the house-elf obeyed. Voldemort left the house-elf to die, and left the cave, laughing at Kreacher. However, the house-elf Disapparated, and told Regulus what had happened. 

Regulus decided that he didn't want to serve Voldemort any more, and also discovered that Voldemort had created a [[Horcrux]]. Regulus went to the cave with Kreacher in order to take [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's locket]] and drank the potion. He then ordered Kreacher to take the locket and leave. Regulus didn't manage to destroy the [[Horcrux]], but was the first person who learned about Voldemort's Horcruxes.


, his family's former house-elf]]
[[Kreacher]], the [[house-elf]] of the [[House of Black|Black family]] was very loyal to Regulus, who always treated him with kindness. Kreacher respected Regulus very much, and he served [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] when the latter asked Regulus to lend him a house-elf.

In fact, Voldemort wanted to test the magical protections of [[Slytherin's Locket|one of his Horcruxes]]. Voldemort ordered Kreacher to drink a [[Emerald Potion|potion]], and the house-elf did so. Kreacher suffered dreadfully when he drank the potion, and he wanted water to quench the burning thirst that resulted. He tried to take some from the lake nearby, but he was caught by the [[Inferius|Inferi]]. However, as Regulus had asked him to come back after he had accomplished Voldemort's task, Kreacher Disapparated and told Regulus what had happened. Voldemort's treatment of Kreacher and the knowledge of his Horcrux troubled Regulus deeply, eventually causing him to turn against his former master. 

Knowing that he could not leave the Death Eaters and live, Regulus asked Kreacher to take him back to [[the Cave]]. This time it was Regulus who drank the potion, even though he could have instead made Kreacher do it for him but apparently saw the house-elf as having suffered enough due to Regulus' connections as a Death Eater. Having made Kreacher promise that he would not tell Walburga about any of this, Regulus switched the lockets and told Kreacher to leave and take the Horcrux locket back. Suffering from the insane thirst caused by the potion, Regulus was dragged under and killed by the [[Inferius|Inferi]] in the lake.

Kreacher was devastated by Regulus's death. It was the knowledge that Harry, Ron and Hermione were endeavouring to do the same thing as Regulus that brought Kreacher onto Harry's side. He fought the Death Eaters of Voldemort in [[1998]], during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], in Regulus's name.


Members of [[House of Black|the Black family]] and their history seem to have made a tradition of naming their children after stars and constellations. As a name, it has also been applied to the star , which is called "Heart of the Lion" in the constellation Leo. It also happens to be the brightest star in that constellation. It is noteworthy to consider that Rowling decidedly picked a name from the constellation that represents a Lion, who is also the animal to represent [[Gryffindor]]. Further more, she picked the star that is The Lion's Heart. The term "Lionheart" is defined as "a person of exceptional courage and bravery." Again the reference to courage being not only an association with the courage Regulus would exemplify when he sacrifices himself to obtain [[Slytherin's locket]], but also a reference to one of the characteristics of being in [[Gryffindor]]. This is a noticeable divergence from the origins of other [[Slytherin]] house member's names, which consistently reference terms which have a correlation with things that reflect the [[Slytherin family|Slytherin house]].

Regulus was also the family name of a Roman general, Marcus Atilius Regulus, who was known for his honour and self-sacrifice.

It is also possible that Orion named Regulus after his grand-uncle, [[Regulus Black I]].

In Latin, ''regulus'' means "little king" and was one term for a [[basilisk]].

It is interesting that in the Russian version of the book, Regulus initials translated as "Р.А.Б.", that sounds like "раб" ("slave" in Russian).



*In the , Regulus was portrayed by [[Tom Moorcroft]] in Slughorn's photograph.
*The glossary on the [[Scholastic]] official website, which appears to have been compiled before the release of ''Deathly Hallows'', it initially claimed that Regulus was killed by his fellow Death Eaters, but had been later modified to state "He was killed by Lord Voldemort" instead.
**Sirius similarly told Harry that Regulus was either killed by Voldemort or on his orders (most likely the latter). It is possible however that Sirius merely assumed that this is what happened or this was a lie told to him by Kreacher.
*[[Remus Lupin]] once told Harry that Regulus only lasted two weeks after his betrayal before being killed, suggesting that either it was known that he was working against Voldemort, or Remus (and probably the rest of the Order) assumed this to be what happened.
*It's unknown what Voldemort believes to have happened to Regulus as he would likely be aware that Regulus wasn't killed by the Death Eaters. It's possible that Voldemort assumed him to have died by other means.
*On the [[House of Black|Black family tree]] depicted in , Regulus' picture is depicted as a skull. [[Hesper Black]] was depicted in a similar way.
*J. K. Rowling stated in an interview that Regulus learned of Voldemort's Horcruxes because the Dark Lord indirectly let it slip, like he did in the Little Hangleton Graveyard. Subsequently, Regulus was intelligent enough to realise what it meant.
*In , when Harry opens the fake locket, a ghost of Regulus appears and blows a raspberry at him to which Harry reacts by throwing the locket off the balcony.
**Also in the game, his character is capable of casting the [[Patronus Charm]], which logically cannot be considered [[canon]]ical since [[J. K. Rowling]] has quoted that Death Eaters (aside from [[Severus Snape]]) were incapable of casting the charm, although it is unknown if an exemption exists for Regulus from this rule, given how similar to Snape, he defected from Voldemort and worked against him. 
*Interestingly, Regulus possessed extreme bravery, chivalry and honesty and thus had all the traits required for a true [[Gryffindor]].
*Regulus started at Hogwarts in [[1972]], one year after Severus Snape. As they were both sorted into Slytherin, it was likely that they knew each other but it is unknown how Severus would have acted towards Regulus since Regulus's brother, Sirius, was one of Snape's biggest rivals and a hated enemy.
*It's possible that Regulus was a part of a [[Gang of Slytherins|group of future Death Eaters]] when he was a student as he was known to have attended Hogwarts at the same time as them, but this is unconfirmed. It should be noted however that his cousin, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] was part of said group.


[[J. K. Rowling]] compared Regulus to [[Draco Malfoy]], his first cousin once removed, who also became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] at a young age and eventually defected. Like Draco, Regulus "''got in a little too deep... He was attracted to it, but the reality of what it meant was way too much to handle''".
