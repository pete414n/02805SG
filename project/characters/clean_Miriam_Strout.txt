'''Madam Miriam Strout''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] or [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Healer]] on the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]. She was described to be a motherly-looking healer.


During her youth, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. In her adult years, she once commented to [[Jacob's sibling]] that [[Herbology]] was not her best [[Hogwarts subjects|subject]] at school.

Strout was a good friend of [[Talbott Winger]]'s [[Talbott Winger's mother|mother]], a fellow Healer employed at St Mungo's and a [[White Swan]] [[Animagus]]. Upon her tragic [[death]], Strout was heartbroken, and in response, her [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] changed to the shape of a White Swan, to commemorate her. She would often let it patrol the hospital to remind her of Talbott Winger's mother doing the same.




During this school year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Strout helped [[seventh year|seventh-year]] students visiting St Mungo's to complete assignments as part of their [[St Mungo's student programme|work experience]] at the hospital.

During this time, she treated [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] in the hospital, who had been suffering from life-threatening [[Fire|burns]],

Strout became a victim of the [[laughing curse]] that was attached to a [[cursed CD case]] that been given to Jacob at the hospital as a supposed get-well gift. Thankfully, Jacob's sibling destroyed the cursed CD case at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and Strout and the others were freed of the curse. She treated the affected patients with [[lozenge]]s and fortifying broth. She then proceeded to inform Talbott Winger, [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] and their sibling of her White Swan Patronus, and how it reflected her friendship with Talbott's mother, as the presence of her Patronus had mystified the students. She also gifted Talbott with his mother's [[St Mungo's Certified Healer Insignia]], with Talbott commenting that he intended to become a Healer himself.

Jacob's sibling asked Strout if she knew anyone called [[Burke]] whilst she was busy in the Alchemy Room, whom they suspected was a [[Dark Wizard]] responsible for the laughing curse outbreak. She was surprised at this suggestion, she told them Burke was a resident healer who had worked at the hospital for many years, and she said she planned to talk to him, but had to urgently leave to attend a meeting.

She later told Jacob's sibling their work experience had finished when [[Alastor Moody]] came to pick them and Jacob up. She thanked them for their work immensely and told them they would achieve great things.




Strout was responsible for looking after long-term patients such as [[Agnes]], [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], and [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]]. When [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] came up to the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] by accident, she led them in, mistaking them wanting to visit Lockhart, who had managed to sneak out of his room for a while.

She was also looking after [[Broderick Bode]] when he was killed by a [[Devil's Snare]] plant sent to him by the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Walden Macnair]], disguised at the time as an elderly wizard. Although [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] had very strict regulations of the gifts allowed into the hospital, Strout mistook the Devil Snare to be a harmless [[Flitterbloom]] and thought the improving Bode could take care of it, a dreadful mistake which cost him his life. She was suspended on full pay whilst the matter was investigated and was unavailable for comments for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. It is unknown if Strout was eventually fired or reinstated in her position.



Strout was evidently a very caring and kind-hearted witch, given her job as a [[Healer]], meaning she specialised in tending to the both the physically and mentally unwell, in the [[Janus Thickey Ward]]. She was very mothering and protective of her vulnerable patients, such as [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], who she even seemed to feel much compassion for, since he received no visitors. However, she was somewhat naive and inattentive in her professional duties, as she foolishly failed to identify a lethal [[Devil's Snare]] plant that had been brought into her hospital ward (mistaking it for a harmless [[Flitterbloom]]), a thoughtless mistake which resulted in her patient [[Broderick Bode]] being killed by the plant, and her being suspended from her position.



*'''[[Healing magic]]''': As a professional [[Healer]] working at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], Strout was highly proficient in the art of medical [[magic]]. She worked in the [[Janus Thickey Ward]], meaning she was very able in looking after people who had suffered permanent [[spell]] damage. Despite Herbology being a requirement, she failed to identify a cutting of Devil's Snare, mistaking it for a harmless Flitterbloom, costing Bode his life.
]]
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Strout was highly capable in charm-work, given how a N.E.W.T. was required in [[Charms (class)|Charms]] for all Healers; furthermore, she was capable of unlocking the locked door to the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] with the [[Unlocking Charm]], as well as fixing a [[fancy hippogriff calendar]] to the wall with her [[wand]] for [[Broderick Bode]]. She could also produce a fully corporeal [[Patronus|Patronus]] in the form of a [[White Swan]], which changed form to resemble the [[Animagus]] form of [[Talbott Winger's mother]].
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Strout was knowledgeable of various healing potions, [[Potions (class)|Potions]] was also a required qualification for Healers like Strout.
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': As a Healer, she would have needed an O.W.L. in this subject at either "Exceeds Expectations" or "Outstanding".
