{{Quote|We'll teach just those whose ancestry's purest.|Slytherin's opinion regarding the running of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Salazar Slytherin''' (fl. c. [[First millennium A.D.|993]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], noted for his cunning and determination. He was regarded as one of the greatest wizards of the age, respectively as a [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]] and as a skilled [[Legilimency|Legilimens]]. Slytherin was one of the [[Hogwarts founders|four founders]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] along with [[Godric Gryffindor]], [[Helga Hufflepuff]] and [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]. He was also the namesake of the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].<ref name="COS9"/>

He mistrusted [[Muggle-born]] students to the point of proposing that they should not be accepted at Hogwarts. However, when he expressed his opinion to the other Hogwarts founders, they did not agree with him. In response, he left the school, never to return. 

Slytherin died sometime after creating the [[Chamber of Secrets]], concealing a [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]]. His intention was to have his heir return to the school and unleash the horror within the chamber. The basilisk would therefore purge the school of those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.<ref name="COS9" />

==Biography==
===Early life===
Salazar Slytherin was raised into a [[pure-blood]] family in either [[Ireland]] or [[Great Britain]], where he was either born or raised in a [[fen]]-land area.<ref name="fen"/> He and his family had the rare [[magic]]al gift of speaking [[Parseltongue]].<ref name="COS11"/> During his youth, he was best friends with [[Godric Gryffindor]].

At some point, Slytherin created his [[Salazar Slytherin's wand|own wand]], made of [[Snakewood]] with a core of [[basilisk horn]]. He taught it the unique ability to "sleep" when commanded in [[parseltongue]].<ref name="PM-ilvermorny" />  

===Hogwarts founder===
[[File:Salazar Slytherin WWHP.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Salazar Slytherin wearing his locket]]
In [[First millennium A.D.|993]], Salazar Slytherin founded [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his adulthood, with friends [[Godric Gryffindor]], [[Helga Hufflepuff]] and [[Rowena Ravenclaw]], though he later severed ties with Gryffindor. He even appeared to have carefully selected members of [[Slytherin|his own House]].<ref name="COS9"/>

The qualities which Slytherin prized in his "handpicked students" included resourcefulness, determination, and a certain disregard for the rules, along with the ability to speak [[Parseltongue]].<ref name="COS18">{{COS|B|18}}</ref> He also selected his students according to their cunning, ambition, and [[Blood status|blood purity]].<ref name="OOTP11">{{OOTP|B|11}}</ref> His House within Hogwarts was symbolised by a serpent,<ref name="COS11">{{COS|B|11}}</ref> with House colours of green and silver.<ref name="colours">{{WW|colours}}</ref>

====Leaving Hogwarts====
{{Quote|I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony, but I never knew he started all this [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood stuff]]. I wouldn't be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the [[Sorting Hat]] had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back home....|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] expressing his disdain for Slytherin's views|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

After founding Hogwarts and co-existing for years. One day, a rift began to grow between Slytherin and the other founders. Slytherin disliked taking students from [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] families, seeing them as untrustworthy and unworthy of being taught magic, and tried to persuade the other [[Hogwarts founders|founders]] to only take students from [[pure-blood]] [[:Category:Pure-blood families|families]]. However, the other founders didn't agree with Slytherin, particularly Gryffindor. 

Eventually, Slytherin and Gryffindor had a bitter and possibly even violent argument over the subject, it is possible that they duelled, or that a civil war of sorts broke out between the houses). Slytherin chose to leave the school eventually, but he had left the Chamber of Secrets and his Basilisk behind,<ref name="COS9" /> and he later died at an old age.

===Post-mortem===
[[File:Chamber.png|250px|thumb|right|The statue of Salazar Slytherin and the hiding-place of Slytherin's Basilisk in the [[Chamber of Secrets]]]]
According to ancient legend, as told by History of Magic Professor [[Cuthbert Binns]], Salazar Slytherin was responsible for the construction of the Chamber of Secrets beneath [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] dungeons. It was specifically created for the purpose of purging the school of all [[Muggle-born]] students. 

The Chamber contained a [[Basilisk]] which could be controlled only by his own "[[Tom Riddle|true heir]]", and be used it to purge the school of all Muggle-borns. At least part of the legend was revealed to be true in [[1943]], when Tom Marvolo Riddle, the heir of Slytherin, opened the Chamber and used the Basilisk to attack Muggle-borns.<ref name="COS9" />

Another popular historical theory mentioned on the [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test]] was that towards the end of his life Salazar reconciled with the other founders and returned to the school and eventually died there.<ref>[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/other-canon/jkr/jkr-w3/ WOMBAT Test 3] from {{JKRS}} (Archived at [https://www.hp-lexicon.org/ The Harry Potter Lexicon])</ref> However this theory had never been proven and the presence of the Basilisk at the school long after his death would suggest such a reconciliation did not occur as he likely would have removed the Basilisk from the school otherwise.

One girl the Basilisk actually killed was a [[ghost]] known by the name of [[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]]. The opening to the Chamber of Secrets is located in the bathroom she now haunted, and can only be opened by speaking Parseltongue, as Slytherin could.<ref name="COS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref> Riddle opened the Chamber again in [[1993]] through the use of one of his seven [[Horcrux]]es, his diary. Using the bit of his soul encompassed by the diary, he possessed [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] and forced her to do his bidding. While he still attacked Muggle-born students, his ultimate goal was to lure Harry Potter into the Chamber and kill him.<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref>

Salazar Slytherin owned a [[Slytherin's Locket|locket]] emblazoned with the letter ''S'' that became an heirloom of his last known line of descendants, the [[House of Gaunt|Gaunts]]. [[Merope Riddle|Merope Gaunt]] sold the locket to [[Caractacus Burke]]. It was then bought up by [[Hepzibah Smith]], who had a love for antiques. It was subsequently stolen from her by [[Tom Riddle]].<ref name="HBP20">{{HBP|B|20}}</ref> Riddle would later turn the locket into a Horcrux,<ref name="HBP23">{{HBP|B|23}}</ref> and conceal it in a [[The Cave|seaside cave]] he had visited in his youth.<ref name="HBP26">{{HBP|B|26}}</ref> The same locket was later removed from the cave by [[Regulus Black]] with aid from his [[house-elf]], [[Kreacher]]. Kreacher was ordered to destroy the locket, but was unable to do so.<ref name="DH10">{{DH|B|10}}</ref>

It was later stolen from the [[House of Black|Black family]] home at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] by [[Mundungus Fletcher]], and eventually found its way into the hands of the Ministry of Magic employee, [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Umbridge used it as a credential by wearing it and claiming the ''S'' stood for [[Selwyn family|Selwyn]], a [[pure-blood]] family line. She either did not know better or wanted to conceal its real meaning from the public.<ref name="DH13">{{DH|B|13}}</ref>

The locket was recovered by [[Harry Potter]], and was later destroyed by [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] with [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's sword]]. This act of destruction removed all of the Horcrux's power.<ref name="DH19">{{DH|B|19}}</ref>

There were also portraits of Slytherin hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]], one guarding a secret shortcut between the dungeon's antechamber and the [[Entrance Hall]] side room. The password required to gain access to said shortcut was ''Mortal Dread''.<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}} - PC version</ref> The other was hung at the [[Headmaster's office]], part of the [[Headmaster portraits]] gallery.<ref name="COSF">{{COS|F}} DVD (Disc 2 - Dumbledore's Office)</ref>

In the [[1997–1998 school year]], Slytherin's heir, Riddle (now known as Lord Voldemort), realised his ancestor's wish of purging the school of Muggle-borns via another method: by taking over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and using [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission|falsified propaganda]].<ref name="DH11">{{DH|B|11}}</ref> Voldemort managed to have Muggle-borns evicted from the wizarding world,<ref name="DH11"/><ref name="DH13"/> and at the end of the year, Voldemort even claimed that Hogwarts no longer needed Sorting, and that Slytherin's symbols, shields and colours would suffice. After Voldemort's death, all of this was repealed, and Slytherin's ultimate desire ended in failure.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>

However, even after Voldemort's death, Salazar Slytherin's bloodline survived through Voldemort's secret daugther [[Delphini]], whom he conceived with [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. As of [[2020]], Delphini was the last known survivor of the Slytherin bloodline.<ref name="CC">{{CC}}</ref>

==Physical description==
[[File:Salazar Slytherin WWHP.jpg|180px|thumb|Salazar Slytherin]]
{{Quote|Then, as Harry drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall... It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous grey feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor.|Description of the Statue of Slytherin|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

The statue of Salazar Slytherin in the [[Chamber of Secrets]] depicted an "''ancient and monkeyish''" man with a "''long thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of his sweeping robes.''"<ref name="COS17"/> His beard was white in colour.<ref name="JKRS"/> [[Marvolo Gaunt]], a blood relative, was similarly described as being [[monkey]]-like in appearance.<ref name="HBP10"/>

==Personality and traits==
Salazar Slytherin was known to possess great cunning and determination, qualities he prized in students of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].<ref name="OOTP11"/> At one point, the Sorting Hat referred to him as "''power-hungry Slytherin''". He seemed to stop at nothing to get what he wanted; this was proven when he constructed the [[Chamber of Secrets]] to purge [[Muggle-born]]s, despite the fact that the other founders disagreed with his beliefs.<ref name="COS9"/> This unrepentant ruthlessness mixed with [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] views would later be adopted by numerous descendants of his, the infamous Voldemort not least of all.<ref name="COS17"/>

Slytherin was also quite proud and vain, as he went to the trouble of immortalising his image in the Chamber of Secrets in the form of a titanic statue standing several dozen feet tall, something that the other three founders were never known to have done.<ref name="COS17"/> An effigy of such proportions would certainly reflect a grandiose image of oneself.<ref name="COS17"/> This love of grandeur was apparently passed onto his bloodline as well, as the descending [[House of Gaunt|Gaunt bloodline]] ended up squandering their fortune for self-indulgent lavishness long before the generation of [[Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo]], who continued to flaunt the little heirlooms he had left in front of others.<ref name="HBP10"/>

Slytherin was said to be one of the greatest wizards of his age,<ref name="COS9"/> with extensive [[magic]]al abilities, particularly in [[Legilimency]].<ref name="JKRS"/> When considering Sorting a student into Slytherin, the [[Sorting Hat]] looks for Slytherin's traits in the student, including cunning, determination, ambition, and resourcefulness.<ref name="COS18"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|It matters, because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.|[[Hermione Granger]] informing [[Harry Potter]] of Slytherin's ability as a Parselmouth|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
*'''[[Parseltongue]]''': Salazar Slytherin was one of the earliest recorded [[Parseltongue|Parselmouths]] and used this ability to control a [[basilisk]]. His house's symbol was a [[Snake|serpent]] due to this, and he passed this trait on to his descendants.<ref name="COS11"/>
*'''[[Legilimency]]''': Slytherin was said to have been a skilled Legilimens.<ref name="JKRS"/>
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': There are rumours that he originally built the Chamber of Secrets as a place to teach students Dark magic as an [[Dark Arts (class)|academic class]].<ref name="PM-chamber"/> Indeed, he was capable of casting the [[Killing Curse]] and the [[Imperius Curse]], which were not [[Unforgivable Curses|unforgivable]] during his lifetime, and was skilled in the handling of [[curse]]d objects, showing him to have been a powerful [[Dark wizard]].<ref name="LEGOY2">{{LEGO|Y2}}</ref>    
*'''[[Wandlore]]'''/'''[[Wandmaker|Wandmaking]]''': Slytherin created his [[Salazar Slytherin's wand|own wand]] of [[Snakewood]] and [[basilisk horn]]. He also taught it the unique ability to "sleep" when instructed.<ref name="PM-ilvermorny" />
*'''[[Basilisk]] breeding''': Slytherin managed to breed [[Serpent of Slytherin|a basilisk]] and kept it alive in the [[Chamber of Secrets]] for over one thousand years, surpassing its average nine-hundred year lifespan.<ref name="COS17"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': With the combined abilities of the other founders, he helped to bewitch the [[Sorting Hat]] into a sentient and talking magical object with personality, to [[Sorting ceremony|sort]] students well after their lifetime.<ref name="PM-sorting hat">{{WW|the-sorting-hat}}</ref> He could also produce at least a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]].<ref name="LEGOY2"/>

==Possessions==
*'''[[Salazar Slytherin's wand|Wand]]''': Slytherin owned a [[wand]] made of [[Snakewood]] with a [[Basilisk horn]] [[Wand core|core]]. It was passed down through the generations until it was stolen from Gormlaith Gaunt by her niece Isolt Sayre, and later buried on the grounds of Ilvermorny School in North America.<ref name="PM-ilvermorny" />
*'''[[Slytherin's Locket|Locket]]''': Slytherin owned a locket which he passed down to his descendants.<ref name="HBP20"/> It was later turned into a Horcrux by his descendant Tom Riddle.<ref name="HBP23"/>

==Etymology==
The name '''Salazar''' is originally a Spaniard name. Salazar is a surname meaning old hall (from Castilian Sala (hall) and Basque zahar (old). The name originates from the town of the same name: Salazar, in northern Burgos, Castile. Although nowadays northern Burgos is not a Basque-speaking region, it was during the early Middle Ages when the surname appeared. Its origins are also related to a certain noble family, the Salazars, that held a fief in the area. During the 10th century, the surname appears as mentioned in Navarre, where it spread and there even exists a Salazar Valley. It later also spread to the rest of the Basque Country, being specially common in Biscay during the 15th century. During that time, Lope García de Salazar, a famous writer, took part in the Reconquista of Cuenca, where he was granted a fief and founded a notable family.{{Fact}}

Alonso de Salazar Frías was a 16th-17th century Spanish inquisitor who is famous for convincing the Spanish Inquisition that most of the  witchcraft cases were based on insanity and confessions made to stop  torture, rather than accurate cases of people associating with the devil. He was able to stop convictions based solely on testimony.{{Fact}}

According to J. K. Rowling, however, Salazar Slytherin was named after the Portuguese dictator, António de Oliveira Salazar, who ruled from 1932 to 1968.<ref>https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/852974465587847168</ref>

Meanwhile, ''Slytherin'' may refer to the words "sly" as well as "slithering", which is the form of locomotion of snakes, possibly referring to his rare ability to talk to snakes called parseltongue.{{Fact}}

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:SalazarSlytherinLEGO.jpg|150px|thumb|Salazar Slytherin as a LEGO mini-figure]]
[[File:Salazar Slytherin.png|150px|thumb|Salazar Slytherin in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]
*Despite the quote attributed to him of Slytherin "only teaching those whose ancestry is purest", Slytherin has long accepted [[half-blood]] witches and wizards into its ranks (most famously [[Severus Snape]] and [[Tom Riddle]]), and in rare cases, [[Muggle-born]]s.
**However, the above is likely done as a matter of necessity, as there are presently no longer enough pure-blood families in existence for Slytherin to sustain itself on just them (something even the genocidal Voldemort and Death Eaters understood, if only begrudgingly).
*Slytherin was the featured "[[Wizard of the Month]]" for June 2007 on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s website, where he was profiled thus: "One of the four celebrated Founders of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Salazar Slytherin was one of the first recorded [[Parseltongue|Parselmouths]], an accomplished [[Legilimency|Legilimens]], and a notorious champion of [[pure-blood]] supremacy".
*In the film, the statue of Salazar Slytherin only covers his head, compared to the book where it was full-body. It was revealed in Page to Screen that the Chamber is flooded so that the rest of the statue below his head is submerged beneath the water.
*Both pictures of Slytherin in the [[Wizard of the Month]] and at the Famous Cards depict Slytherin with steepled fingers.
*Salazar Slytherin appears as a portrait in the "Forbidden Journey" ride at Universal Orlando, where he expresses his dislike for [[Harry Potter]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]]. He is also the only one of the four Founders to appear in behind the scenes footage of the ride. A DVD extra shows the actor being dressed up on set.
*Although it was briefly speculated in ''The Chamber of Secrets'', Harry is not, in fact, a direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin, though he ''is ''still distantly related to him; Voldemort is descended from Slytherin and the second Peverell brother, while Harry is a descendant of the third.
*Though Voldemort is a descendant of both Salazar Slytherin and Cadmus Peverell, there is no evidence that Slytherin is an ancestor of Peverell.
*The depiction of Salazar on his Chocolate Frog Card bears a striking resemblance to [[w:c:captainplanet:Verminous Skumm|Verminous Skumm]], an antagonist from ''Captain Planet and the Planeteers''.
*Slytherin built the Chamber of Secrets to allow his heir to purge the school of Muggle-borns. However, after the chamber's failure, Voldemort accomplished Slytherin's wishes with another method: by taking over the Ministry of Magic and creating the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]].
*Although it has been suggested that Salazar Slytherin was from the Fens in eastern England, it is not confirmed. It would make sense if Slytherin came from Ireland, as that would mean that the four founders of Hogwarts would have originated from the four main countries that make up a vast majority of Hogwarts students. Scotland (Ravenclaw), Wales (Hufflepuff), England (Gryffindor) and Ireland. Ireland does not have snakes, it is unknown when and where Slytherin discovered his Parselmouth abilities, and the Gaunt family, his descendants, have lived in both England and Ireland.
*He is played by actor [[Ken Bones]] in {{HPFJ}}.<ref name="imdb">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0094297/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t1 Ken Bones's profile on IMDb]</ref>
*His dislike of wizards and witches with [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] parentage may have stemmed from the political climate he lived in, where magic users were persecuted and actively hunted by Muggles.
*Since snakewood is not naturally found in what Muggles call the Old World,<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakewood Wikipedia - Snakewood]</ref> it is likely that Slytherin travelled to [[North America|North]] or [[South America]] or to [[Australia]] to acquire the wood for his wand. Given that travel between the continents at the time being exclusive to the wizarding world and the vikings of the muggle world, this is not an implausible scenario.
*In 2019, a new species of pit viper discovered in [[Wikipedia:Arunachal Pradesh|Arunachal Pradesh]], [[India]] was named ''[[Wikipedia:Trimeresurus salazar|Trimeresurus salazar]]'', after Salazar Slytherin.<ref>[https://zse.pensoft.net/article/48431/element/8/21033// A new species of green pit vipers of the genus Trimeresurus Lacépède, 1804 (Reptilia, Serpentes, Viperidae) from western Arunachal Pradesh, India]</ref>
*Although his only known descendant in [[2020]] was [[Delphini]], Salazar may have descendants in [[United States of America|America]] via [[Martha Steward II|Martha Steward]].
**Martha, however, was a [[Squib]], and she married [[Martha Steward II's husband|a Muggle]], so if there were descendants of hers in America, they most likely would be Muggle-born wizards, or Muggles, so ironically Salazar Slytherin may have had descendants who were in the two categories of people he hated most.
