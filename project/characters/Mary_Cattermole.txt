==Etymology==
[[File:LEGO Mary.png|thumb|Mary Cattermole as depicted in {{LEGO|Y2}}]] 
"Mary" is the English form of Maria, which was the Latin form of the New Testament Greek names Μαριαμ (''Mariam'') and Μαρια (''Maria'') (the spellings are interchangeable) which in turn come from the Hebrew name מִרְיָם (''Miryam''). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", and "wished for child". It is also possible that the source of the name lies in ancient Egyptian, and was derived from ''mry'' "beloved" or ''mr'' "love".
