[[File:Trial1.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Dolores Umbridge interrogates Mary in the ''[[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]'' court room|left]]
In [[1997]], Mary was accused of stealing the [[Mary Cattermole's wand|wand]] of a [[pure-blood]] or [[half-blood]] witch or wizard, and was brought before a trial by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. She was interrogated by [[Dolores Umbridge]] and [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]], and would have been convicted and sent to [[Azkaban]] if not for the help of Harry and Hermione (disguised as [[Albert Runcorn]] and [[Mafalda Hopkirk]] respectively). Harry, Hermione and Ron (disguised as her husband Reginald Cattermole) assisted her and a group of Muggle-borns who had been in for questioning escape the Ministry. Harry advised Mary and Reg to take their children and flee the country while [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] was still in power.

It is unknown if Mary and Reginald managed to escape successfully, or what happened to them and their children after the war.

==Physical appearance==
Mary was a woman with dark brown [[Human hair|hair]], blue eyes and fair skin.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Mary was capable of at least producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], a mark of [[magic]]al ability given the charm's high level of difficulty to perform.

==Possessions==
*'''[[Mary Cattermole's wand|Wand]]''': Mary owned a [[wand]] that was 8¾" in length and made of [[Cherry (tree)|cherry]] with a [[unicorn hair]] [[Wand core|core]]. The Muggle-born Registration Commission confiscated her wand in 1997 on the grounds of her being Muggle-born.

==Etymology==
[[File:LEGO Mary.png|thumb|Mary Cattermole as depicted in {{LEGO|Y2}}]] 
"Mary" is the English form of Maria, which was the Latin form of the New Testament Greek names Μαριαμ (''Mariam'') and Μαρια (''Maria'') (the spellings are interchangeable) which in turn come from the Hebrew name מִרְיָם (''Miryam''). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", and "wished for child". It is also possible that the source of the name lies in ancient Egyptian, and was derived from ''mry'' "beloved" or ''mr'' "love".

==Behind the scenes==
*Mary Cattermole was portrayed by [[Kate Fleetwood]] in {{DH|F1}}.
*In the film, it was Ron, not Harry, who warned Mary to take her family and flee the country, though she thought he was her husband at the time, and proceeded to kiss him.
*Mary does not wear her hair in a bun in the film.
