'''Hugo Granger-Weasley''' (probably born between September 2007 and August 2008) was a [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the second child of [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. He had an older sister named [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]].



Hugo Granger-Weasley was born around 2008 to a [[pure-blood]] father and a [[Muggle-born]] mother, making him [[half-blood]]. He was about two years younger than his sister [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]], and around the same age as his cousin [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Potter]], daughter of [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]], and the two seemed to be quite close.

He, along with the rest of his family, attended the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]] and sat in VIP Box Two. He was supporting [[Brazil]] in the final Brazil-[[Bulgaria]] match, as were his sister and father, but his mother remained neutral.

''' '''in [[2017]]]]
In 2017, he accompanied his parents to see off his sister and his [[Potter family|Potter]] cousins to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Hugo and Lily shared an eagerness to go to Hogwarts, despite both of them being too young. At [[King's Cross Station|King's Cross Station,]] the two had "''an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts''".


Hugo has his mother's brown bushy hair.


'''' is a Latinised form of the Germanic or Teutonic name ''Hugh'', meaning "bright in spirit and mind". French novelist and poet  was a famous bearer of this name. J. K. Rowling loved his works. As a muggle-born and a book lover, it is possible that Hermione enjoyed Victor Hugo's work as well, and named her son after him.

It is also possible that Ron and Hermione wanted their children to have the same initials as their parents, ''R'' and ''H''. Interestingly, both children also have names consisting of four letters.

 was also awarded the , so it is possible that this was [[J. K. Rowling]]'s way of thanking them for that honour.


*Hugo is portrayed in  by [[Ryan Turner]].
*In , Hugo appears licking a lollipop. His father, Ron, tries to swipe it from him but misses, as Hugo moves his arm.
*In the film, Hugo has red hair like his father instead of brown hair like his mother. This is likely because the information about his hair colour was released after the film.
*Hugo does not make an appearance in the Cursed Child, even though he was present in the same event (first year of Albus Potter) in the Epilogue of Deathly Hallows.
