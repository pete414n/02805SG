==Biography==
===First Wizarding War===
Rookwood worked as an [[Unspeakable]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]], but became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and spy for [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]. He had an information network inside and outside of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] with a number of well-connected wizards. Whether or not these wizards knew they were being used for information by Rookwood is unknown.

What is known is that [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] gave Rookwood information. Bagman was likely ignorant of the fact of Rookwood's real affiliations, since Rookwood dangled the prospect of a Ministry position before him. Bagman's testimony revealed that Augustus Rookwood was friends with his [[Ludovic Bagman's father|father]]. He also referred to Rookwood rather affectionately as "Old Rookwood", despite the man being a Death Eater, during his own court case.<ref name="GOF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref> From that information, it can be deduced that Rookwood was outgoing and perhaps affable during his years as a spy, breaking the mould of so many other Death Eaters to serve as a cover.

In [[1981]], Rookwood was captured and convicted on testimony from [[Igor Karkaroff]] as to his Death Eater activities and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]]. This was one of many names that Karkaroff surrendered in order to achieve his own freedom, and the first one to be viable, as the ones before were already caught or killed.<ref name="GOF30" />

===Second Wizarding War===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Lord Voldemort|Stand up, Rookwood. You have done well to tell me this. Very well... I have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems.... But no matter... We begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort's gratitude, Rookwood....|Rookwood|My Lord ... yes, My Lord|I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give me.|Of course, My Lord, of course... anything...|Very well... you may go. Send [[Avery II|Avery]] to me.|Lord Voldemort to Rookwood|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Augustus Rookwood in Azkaban.png|240x240px|thumb|left|Augustus Rookwood during his imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]]]

During the [[Second Wizarding War]], Rookwood [[Azkaban escapes#1996|escaped]] Azkaban along with nine other Death Eaters in [[1996]], when the [[Dementor]]s defected to the recently returned [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. This was Azkaban's largest and most notorious breakout and helped set the stage for the Second Wizarding War.<ref name="OOTP25">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref>

Rookwood was responsible for getting Voldemort on track with stealing the [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] which concerned the Dark Lord and [[Harry Potter]], who saw Rookwood in one of his dreams. Obviously, his experience in the [[Department of Mysteries]] made him a valuable asset in this function.<ref name="OOTP26">{{OOTP|B|26}}</ref>

====Battle of the Department of Mysteries====
{{Quote|Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew over Harry’s head as he launched himself toward [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] —|Rookwood attempting to kill Kingsley Shacklebolt in the Department of Mysteries|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Augustus Rookwood Held Ron Weasley Hostage.png|thumb|right|250px|Rookwood threatening [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] in the Death Chamber]]
After numerous attempts at stealing the prophecy failed, Voldemort lured Harry to the Ministry by sending him visions of his godfather [[Sirius Black]] being tortured there. Rookwood was one of the Death Eaters who participated in the ambush of Harry and his five friends, and in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|battle]] which ensued when the teenagers resisted. He was the only one not assigned a partner as the Death Eaters pursued the six [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members.<ref name="OOTP35">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref>

When Order of the Phoenix members arrived he was duelling with [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] without his [[Death Eater Mask|mask]] on.<ref name="OOTP35" /> It is presumed that Rookwood, along with all the other Death Eaters aside from [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], was captured and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] after the battle.

However, he was again at large the [[1997|following year]], after another [[Azkaban escapes#1997|Azkaban break-out]].<ref name="DH32"/>

====Battle of Hogwarts====
{{Quote|ROOKWOOD!|Percy Weasley chasing after Rookwood|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Death Eaters-Battle of Hogwarts-DHP2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Rookwood with other Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts]]
Rookwood fought during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]].<ref name="DH32">{{DH|B|32}}</ref><ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}} - {{see image|File:Death Eaters-Battle of Hogwarts-DHP2.jpg}} - fourth the right of Narcissa Malfoy</ref> After [[Fred Weasley]] was killed in an explosion, [[Percy Weasley]] chased after Rookwood as he was attacking some of the other students who had stayed to fight rather than evacuate the school.<ref name="DH32"/> Later in the battle, he was [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by [[Aberforth Dumbledore]].<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref> It is unknown what happened to him after Voldemort was defeated, but if he survived, it is likely that he was captured and again sent to Azkaban.

==Physical appearance==
Rookwood was described, judging by his mugshot seen in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', as a tall, pock-marked and grey greasy-haired [[Wizardkind|wizard]].<ref name="OOTP25" /> As Ludo Bagman described him as "''old'' Rookwood" and given his status as a friend of Bagman's father, he was likely an older man by the time the [[First Wizarding War]] ended.<ref name="GOF30"/> As a Death Eater, he bore the [[Dark Mark]] on his left inner forearm.

==Personality and traits==
Judging by his mugshot seen in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', Rookwood seemed bored, contrasting from the other [[Death Eaters]], who were sneering and glaring.<ref name="OOTP25"/> He also appeared being outgoing and perhaps affable, being a friend of [[Ludovic Bagman's father]]. This is further supported by everyone's surprise when [[Igor Karkaroff]] sold him out as a Death Eater.<ref name="GOF30"/> He was also shown to be rather fearful of Lord Voldemort when delivering bad news to him. However, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Rookwood showed his power in combat, as he did not hesitate to attack students who remained in the battlefield.<ref name="DH32"/> Despite joining Voldemort out of fear, Rookwood was 
was shown to be highly loyal to his master.<ref name="OOTP26"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Rookwood would have been accomplished with Dark Magic, being a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. During the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], he attempted to kill Kingsley Shacklebolt with the [[Killing Curse]].<ref name="OOTP35"/> 
*'''[[Martial magic]]''': Rookwood was proficient at [[duelling]] as he fought Kingsley Shacklebolt head on in [[1996]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. It should be noted however that he was defeated by Kingsley during the same duel.<ref name="OOTP35"/> He participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], invading the school and attacking students. He was also shown chasing after a group of students, implying that even together they were unable to subdue Rookwood.<ref name="DH32"/> He was however [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] defeated during the final battle by [[Aberforth Dumbledore]].<ref name="DH36"/>
*'''[[Magic]]al knowledge''': Due to his past employment in the [[Department of Mysteries]], Rookwood came to amass certain important information from the various research there, such as the consequence of an unauthorised person trying to remove a [[prophecy]]. He relayed these valuable information to Voldemort.<ref name="OOTP26"/> This also indicated good spying skills, as he was convicted only when one of his fellow Death Eaters betrayed him.<ref name="GOF30"/>

==Etymology==
*Rookwood was named as Algernon Rookwood in the first UK editions of {{OOTP}}, but his name reverted to Augustus again later on. This mistake was corrected in the U.S. edition of the text.
*[[Wikipedia:Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] is Latin for "majestic" or "venerable", derived from the Latin ''augere'', "to increase". It was the title given to the first emperor of Rome and subsequently to make other Roman emperors.
*Rooks are known to be extremely sociable birds, and also have a kind of caw that sounds like a croak.<ref>[http://www.rspb.org.uk/birds/guide/r/rook/index.asp "Rook - The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds"] from [http://www.rspb.org.uk/ The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]</ref> Rookwood is indicated to be a sociable wizard, and when he was seen speaking to Voldemort, he was hoarse and his tone was described as a croak.
*In addition to Rooks being known for being highly sociable birds, they belong to the bird family Corvidae which includes Crows, Magpies, Ravens, Jackdaws among others and they are known for being highly intelligent and cunning. This "intelligent and cunning" aspect is fitting as until he was betrayed by a former colleague/Death Eater, no one suspected him to be a Dark Wizard and he used this to spy for Voldemort within the Ministry of Magic itself.  
*The surname "Rookwood" may also come from [[Wikipedia:Ambrose Rokewood|Ambrose Rookwood]], one of the conspirators in the [[Wikipedia:Gunpowder Plot|Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605.
*Rookwood is also a family in the 1834 romance of the same name written by [[Wikipedia:William Ainsworth|William Harrison Ainsworth]]. In the novel, the Rookwood family are described quite negatively: ''No mate ever brook would a Rook of the Rookwood! A merry saying it is, and true. No woman ever stood in a Rookwood's way but she was speedily removed—that's certain.''
*Other possible references from ''Rookwood'' are the surname [[Lisa Turpin|Turpin]] (Lisa Turpin), from the famous highwayman, and the [[Hand of Glory]] that is the subject of a poem within the book.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23564/23564-h/23564-h.htm "''Rookwood'' by William Harrison Ainsworth"] from [http://www.gutenberg.org The Project Gutenberg]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Rookwood was played by [[Richard Trinder]] in {{OOTP|FA}}<ref>[http://www.spotlight.com/interactive/cv/1/M20703.html Spotlight - CV]</ref> and {{DH|F2}}.<ref>{{IMDb name|0872937|Richard Trinder}}</ref>
*Due to his baleful and ugly appearance, Rookwood is commonly mistaken for [[Rodolphus Lestrange]].
