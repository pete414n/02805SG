{{Quote|Some of these wandless can be troublesome. While they do nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case in the Ministry next week.

'''Travers''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Dark Wizard]] and a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. He fought in the [[First Wizarding War]], during which he helped murder [[Marlene McKinnon]] and her [[McKinnon family|family]], and was imprisoned for committing this crime.<ref name="GOF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref> 

Travers escaped from [[Azkaban]] after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] in [[1995]] and fought in several battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]], including the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], the [[Ambush at the Lovegood House]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. His ultimate fate is uncertain.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Travers was born into the [[Travers family]], one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]] families published in the ''[[Pure-Blood Directory]]'' in the [[1930s]].<ref>{{WW|pure-blood}}</ref>

===First Wizarding War===
During the First Wizarding War, Travers murdered the family of [[Marlene McKinnon]], according to [[Igor Karkaroff]]. According to Karkaroff, Travers was among Lord Voldemort's most important supporters.<ref name="GOF30"/> He could not escape imprisonment and was sentenced to [[Azkaban]] sometime in, or prior to, [[1981]] for this crime.

===Second Wizarding War===
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|But I thought ''[[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]]'' was in Azkaban?|Kingsley Shacklebolt|Hermione, there's obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up. Travers's hood fell off when I cursed him, he's supposed to be inside too.|[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and Kingsley after the Battle of the Seven Potters|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Travers likely escaped from [[Azkaban]] in the mass breakout in early [[1996]] and once again served Voldemort as an active Death Eater.

[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-13600.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Travers threatening [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] in the Death Chamber]]
He was apparently arrested at some point afterwards, though he escaped again in the [[Azkaban escapes|1997 mass break-out]] with [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] that was hushed up by the [[British Ministry of Magic]] as [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] said that Travers should be in Azkaban.<ref name="DH5">{{DH|B|5}}</ref> On [[27 July]], 1997 Travers participated in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], pursuing Hermione Granger, who was disguised as [[Harry Potter]], and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], who [[curse]]d him, causing his hood to fall back revealing to Shacklebolt that he had broken out of prison.<ref name="DH5" />

Before the beginning of August of the same year, Travers was convicted again for his [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] activities.<ref name="DHvg_pt1">{{DH|G1}}</ref>

====Fall of the Ministry====
{{Quote|Many regular ''Potterwatch'' listeners will know that the Ministry's hushed up a mass breakout from Azkaban. Escapees include the infamous Death Eater Travers and Stan Shunpike, that you may have met on the Knight Bus.|[[Fred Weasley]] during a ''Potterwatch'' broadcast|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game)}}
[[File:Meeting at Malfoy Manor.jpg|250px|thumb|Death Eaters meeting held at Malfoy Manor during the height of the Second Wizarding War]]
On [[1 August]], 1997, the [[British Ministry of Magic]] was [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|taken over]] by the [[Death Eaters]] and [[Pius Thicknesse]] (under the influence of the [[Imperius Curse]]) was made Minister for Magic.<ref>{{DH|B|8}}</ref>

Travers was then released from [[Azkaban]] when the Death Eater-led Ministry hosted up a mass breakout.<ref name="DHvg_pt1" />

Now falsely cleared, Travers went on to work at the Ministry of Magic (at the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]), as a superior to [[Mafalda Hopkirk]]. He also seemed to have some involvement with the recently created [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]], as he got to choose which Ministry employee could act as a stenographer for the Muggle-born trials.<ref name="DH13">{{DH|B|13}}</ref>

====Ambush at the Lovegood House====

[[File:Ambush lovegood.gif|250px|thumb|left|Death Eaters Travers and Selwyn ambushing the Lovegood home]]
In early [[1998]], Travers and [[Selwyn]] came to [[Xenophilius Lovegood]]'s [[Lovegood house|home]] because he claimed, truthfully, that [[Harry Potter]] was there. After Travers [[Human-presence-revealing Spell|checked the area]], they threatened to kill [[Luna Lovegood]], his daughter, if he summoned them under false pretences, only to see Harry escape.<ref name="DH21">{{DH|B|21}}</ref>

====Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank====

[[File:Hermione & Ron In Disguise.jpg|250px|thumb|Ron and Hermione (disguised as Dragomir Despard and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]) breaking into Gringotts Bank]]
Later that year, Travers met [[Hermione Granger]], disguised by means of the [[Polyjuice Potion]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], and went into [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] with her. While there he expressed disdain towards [[Muggle-born]] [[Wandless|beggars]] as well as goblins; a Muggle-born witch had previously begged Travers to represent her case to insist she was magical, and requested his wand to prove it, which Travers refused and cruelly mocked her. Harry placed him under the [[Imperius Curse]] to facilitate their breaking in to the [[Lestrange Vault]] and sent Travers off to hide.<ref name="DH26">{{DH|B|26}}</ref>

====Battle of Hogwarts====
On [[2 May]], [[1998]] Travers took part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. During the conflict, Travers fought [[Parvati Patil]] and [[Dean Thomas]] with the help of [[Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]] and another Death Eater.<ref name="DH32">{{DH|B|32}}</ref> His ultimate fate is uncertain though it's likely that he was either killed in battle, imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for his crimes, or on the run from the law, following the [[Voldemort's Last Stand|defeat]] of Voldemort and the Death Eaters.

==Physical appearance==
Travers was described as a tall, thin [[Wizardkind|wizard]] with a crown of bushy grey hair, a long sharp nose, and a cool voice.<ref name="hair" /> As a Death Eater, he bore the [[Dark Mark]] on his left inner forearm, which had faded to a mere scar since Voldemort's death.

==Personality and traits==
Travers was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], obsessed with [[Pure-blood supremacy|blood purity]]. In [[1998]], he expressed his disdain towards [[Muggle-born]] [[Wandless|beggars]], whom he laughed at (going as far as calling them "it"), as well as [[goblin]]s, whom he didn't like to associate with. He was also something of a xenophobe: when he was met with an apparently foreign wizard, Dragomir Despard (in truth [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]), Travers didn't shake hands with him with his entire hand, but instead just used two of his fingers, acting as though he feared he would be soiled, despite being told that the man is sympathetic to their cause.<ref name="DH26" /> His hatred towards Muggles lead him to hate [[blood traitor]]s as well, as he brutally murdered a member of the Order of the Phoenix and her entire family. He seemed quite calm and composed as an individual, especially when compared to more mentally unstable Death Eaters such as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] or [[Selwyn]]. He also took the pragmatic action of using the Human-presence-revealing spell when [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] claimed to have Harry Potter, even when Selwyn believed him to be lying. He was willing to be social with other Death Eaters shown when he greeted Bellatrix Lestrange (actually a disguised [[Hermione Granger]]) and spoke with her on their way to [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]], though he was also suspicious of her presence and continued to watch her. He was also offended when Bellatrix (again Hermione) suggested that he did not have as much of Lord Voldemort's favour as she, showing that he desired his master's approval.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], Travers was highly talented and well-versed in dark magic, being an accomplished [[Dark Wizard]]. He would have been very capable of casting multiple [[dark charm]]s and most likely the [[Unforgivable Curses]].
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Being a high ranking Death Eater, Travers was a competent duellist. During the [[First Wizarding War]] he took part in the murder of the [[McKinnon family]], who [[Rubeus Hagrid]] described as some of the best wizards and witches of their time. He was however unable to overcome [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] while flying during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and was injured in the process. He also took part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] where he was briefly seen duelling against [[Parvati Patil]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Travers was shown to be proficient in charm-work, as he capable of casting the rather advanced [[Human-presence-revealing Spell]] in order to reveal the presence of [[Harry Potter]] during the [[Ambush at the Lovegood House]] in [[1997]].
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Travers was furthermore an accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer, as he took part in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], in which he fought members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] whilst flying.

==Possessions==
*'''[[Wand]]''': Travers's wand was of unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]], and [[Wand core|core]] material. He used it to cast the [[Human-presence-revealing Spell]] to detect the presence of [[Harry Potter]] during the [[ambush at the Lovegood House]] in 1998.<ref name="DH21" /> A [[Wandless|convicted Muggle-born witch]] pleaded Travers to lend her his wand to prove she was a witch, but he refused and cruelly mocked her.<ref name="DH26" />
*'''[[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] vault''': It is likely that Travers had a vault at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], because that is where he was going when he met "[[Hermione Granger|Bellatrix Lestrange]]", actually Hermione, "[[Ronald Weasley|Dragomir Despard]]", actually Ron (both in [[Polyjuice Potion|disguise]]), and Harry and [[Griphook]] under the [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]], in [[Diagon Alley]], during [[1998]]. He was also seen holding a key. It is unknown if this is his family vault or his own personal one, though as he comes from an old Pure-Blood family the former is most likely.

==Etymology==
''Travers'' is an English and French surname that described a man who lived near a bridge or ford, or occasionally as an occupational name for the collector of tolls at such a location. It is derived from the Old French verb ''traverser'', meaning "to cross"<ref>[http://surnames.behindthename.com/php/search.php?terms=French&title=French+Names&usage=yes Behind the Name: French Surnames]</ref>.

Travers also shares a surname with the writer [[wikipedia:P. L. Travers|P. L. Travers]], author of the ''[[wikipedia:Mary Poppins|Mary Poppins]]'' books: J. K. Rowling is an admirer of P. L. Travers and followed Travers in having her books published under her first two initials and surname rather than her full name.<ref>Picardie, Justine. "[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3562643/Was-P-L-Travers-the-real-Mary-Poppins.html Was P L Travers the real Mary Poppins?]". ''The Daily Telegraph'', 28 October 2008.</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, Travers is portrayed by [[Tav MacDougall]]<ref name="Forum">See [[Forum:Incorrectly identified Death Eaters]]</ref>. Travers participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in the film.
*He's likely related to [[Torquil Travers]].
*It's possible that he participated in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and was one of the Death Eaters who duelled either Ron or Lupin. If this is true this may explain why he was sent back to Azkaban before the final break out.
*In {{DH|F2}}, Travers is absent from the scene of the [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)|Break-in of Gringotts]] and, as such, is never placed under the Imperius Curse.
