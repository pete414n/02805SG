{{Quote|...a new find called Demelza Robins, who was ''particularly'' good at dodging [[Bludger]]s|Demelza's skills as a Chaser|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
'''Demelza Robins''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She was a [[Chaser]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], and was noted to be particularly skilled at dodging [[Bludger]]s.<ref name="HBP11"/>

==Biography==
===Hogwarts years===
====Early years====
Upon her arrival at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] Demelza was sorted into the house of [[Gryffindor]]. Demelza had a talent for the sport [[Quidditch]] but had not tried out for the Quidditch team yet as almost every year they had full capacity.

====1996-1997 school year====

[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-romilda,_lavender,_and_Demelza.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Demelza sitting next to [[Lavender Brown]] at the Start-of-Term Feast]]
In [[1996]] after the graduation of former members [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Angelina Johnson]], and the [[Fred and George Weasley|Weasley twins]], Demelza tried out for the new Quidditch team positions and made it as Chaser.<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>

Later in the year she was trusted to bring Harry the time and place of [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s next private lesson with Harry, and also a note from [[Severus Snape]] that stated he will be doing his detention no matter how many [[Slug Club|party invitations]] he had received, and that he would be sorting out fresh [[Flobberworm]]s from rotten ones, without the use of protective gloves.<ref name="HBP11"/>

During the [[1996–1997 school year|1996-1997 Quidditch season]], Demelza was injured and [[Harry Potter]] used ''[[Episkey]]'' on her to stop her nose from bleeding, which was accidentally caused by [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. Demelza normally avoided accidents on the pitch, being rather good at avoiding [[Bludger]]s. Ron Weasley also shouted at Demelza unexpectedly, resulting in her breaking down in tears.<ref name="HBP14">{{HBP|B|14}}</ref>

====1997-1998 school year====
Not being in [[Harry Potter]]'s year and the [[1997–1998 school year]] being Harry's final year of education meant that Demelza would also be returning to continue her education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1997]] after the death of former Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. With Dumbledore dead the school was to be taken over by [[Minerva McGonagall]] but with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s rise to power [[Severus Snape]] took to the position.

====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
In last few months of the school year the [[Second Wizarding War]] came to a close with the Battle of Hogwarts. Lord Voldemort and his [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] army invaded the castle and a battle broke out to defend it and protect Harry Potter. The castle was almost completely destroyed and there were many casualties. It is unknown if Demelza was present for the battle or if she was too young to stay in combat.

===Later life===
Demelza survived the [[Second Wizarding War]] and gave birth to at least one daughter, [[Nienna Robins]].<ref name="WU"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Demelza was an accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, as she was considered a good enough player to earn a spot on the Gryffindor team as a [[Chaser]]. [[Harry Potter]] also remarked that she was particularly talented at dodging [[Bludger]]s.<ref name="HBP11"/>

==Etymology==
Demelza as a name is most commonly found in the Caucasus region and the areas near the Caspian Sea, and is likely from some of the North Caucasian dialects.  Outside of the Caucasus region, Demelza began as a Cornish place name that meant either "fort of Maeldaf" or "thy sweetness" ("de" meaning thy and "melza" meaning honey or sweet in Cornish).<ref>"[http://www.behindthename.com/name/demelza Demelza]" on Behind the Name</ref> It only came into use as a given name in the [[1950s]], after the novelist [[Wikipedia:Winston Graham|Winston Graham]] chose it for the title character of his [[1946]] novel, ''Demelza'', which was the second instalment in his ''[[Wikipedia:The Poldark Novels|Poldark]]'' series.<ref>''The Penguin Dictionary of First Names'' by David Pickering</ref> [[J. K. Rowling]] may have chosen it as a tribute to [http://www.demelza.org.uk/ Demelza Hospice Care for Children], a charity supported by [[Daniel Radcliffe]].<ref>"[http://www.veritaserum.com/article.php?a=s&aid=4918 Dan's 17th birthday request]" from Veritaserum</ref>
