{{Dialogue a-b|Petunia Dursley|Vernon tells me you're a ''wonderful'' golfer, Mr Mason...|Mason|I play, occassionally.|[[Petunia Dursley]] practising compliments for Mr Mason|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
'''Mr Mason''' was a rich builder from whom [[Vernon Dursley]] was hoping to get a big drill order in [[1992]].<ref name="COS1">{{COS|B|1}}</ref>

==Biography==
On [[31 July]], Mr Mason and his [[Mason's wife|wife]] were dinner guests at the [[4 Privet Drive|Dursley home]]. The evening was nearly ruined when the dessert [[Petunia Dursley]] had made crashed to the floor (an incident blamed on [[Harry Potter]], though it was actually [[Dobby]]'s fault). The evening could have been rescued were it not for the barn [[owl]] that flew through the open window and dropped a letter on Mrs Mason's head. Mr Mason then informed the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] that his wife was mortally afraid of [[bird]]s. He then left their home quickly following after his screaming wife.<ref name="COS2">{{COS|B|2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The English word "''mason''" means a craftsmen, normally a stoneworker, and originally leaders of teams of builders. This is likely a reference to Mr Mason's position as head of a building company.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Mr._Mason_LEGO.jpg|140px|thumb|Mr Mason as seen in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
*Mr Mason was portrayed by [[Jim Norton]] in {{COS|FA}}.
*In {{COS|FA}}, the pudding, levitated by [[Dobby]], crashed down on Mrs Mason's head, ruining the dinner party and causing [[Vernon Dursley]] to lock Harry in his bedroom. Also, instead of the Ministry owl dropping a letter on Mrs Mason, Petunia said: "Would you like some ice cream, Mr and Mrs Mason?"
*In a deleted scene, Mr Mason was said that he was a wonderful golfer and he says that he plays occasionally. This was his only line in the film but was cut out from the theatre version.
