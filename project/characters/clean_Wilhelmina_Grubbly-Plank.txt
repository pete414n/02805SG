'''Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who worked as a substitute [[Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].  She was first met by [[Harry Potter]]'s batch in [[1994]], taking over lessons when [[Rubeus Hagrid|Professor Rubeus Hagrid]] was unable to teach. She taught the class again in part of the next school year when Hagrid was away on a mission for [[Albus Dumbledore]].



Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank was born in or before 1930. She presumably sat for [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] and [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]] in her youth, in order to have her current job, and likely achieved a high grade in [[Care of Magical Creatures]].


[[1994–1995 school year|1994–1995]]


Professor Grubbly-Plank took over [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s lessons during [[January]] [[1995]], because Hagrid was indisposed after the defamatory article about him written by [[Rita Skeeter]], about his status as a [[Half-giant]]. In the first lesson of the year, she taught the students about [[Unicorn]]s. When Hagrid resumed teaching in early [[February]], Grubbly-Plank was no longer required and she left the school. All the students present in her Care of Magical Creature lessons found her to be a good teacher.

[[1995–1996 school year|1995–1996]]

As Hagrid was absent in the beginning of the next school year, Grubbly-Plank was temporarily put in charge of [[Care of Magical Creatures]] again. She led the [[first year]]s across the [[Great Lake|Lake]] on the enchanted boats, which was usually Hagrid's responsibility.

When [[Hedwig]] was hurt when returning from [[London]] on [[7 October]] [[1995]], Harry asked Grubbly-Plank to heal her, which she did without much difficulty. Grubbly-Plank passed [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s (then-[[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor of Hogwarts]]) inspection without incident while she taught her students about [[Bowtruckle]]s and gave out a homework assignments, to sketch and label a drawing of one.

After [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s return on [[7 November]], Grubbly-Plank was relieved of her duties again. When Hagrid planned to leave Hogwarts at the end of this school year, he implied that Grubbly-Plank would take on the class full-time. When he ran away from Umbridge and the Aurors, it is unknown whether she returned to teach Care of Magical Creatures for the remainder of that school year, though following the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Dumbledore did order [[Cornelius Fudge]] to have his [[Auror]]s call off the search for Hagrid so that he could return to work, indicating that he resumed the position following that event.


Professor Grubbly-Plank was described as an elderly witch with short grey hair and a very prominent pointed chin.



Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank was a very competent teacher, passing even [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s inspection without incident (though Umbridge was disappointed by her expressing approval of Dumbledore). She always seemed level-headed, cheerful and efficient, and claimed to be very happy with the way [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] governed [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She also appeared to be kind-hearted and caring towards her students, as she helped nurse Harry Potter's pet owl Hedwig back to health after she was injured, showing her respect for animal life forms.

Many of her students ([[Gryffindor]]s included) felt that Professor Grubbly-Plank was a somewhat better teacher than [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] never admitted this though however, simply because of their very close friendship with Hagrid. Professor Grubbly-Plank also seemed to be very respectful towards Hagrid as she never criticised his teaching skills and even complimented his training of the school [[Thestral]]s. She further showed her respect for Hagrid when she brusquely refused to inform Harry Potter of his whereabouts, thoughtfully regarding his highly important and classified [[Mission to the Giant colony|mission]] with the [[Giant]]s. She was also known to smoke a pipe in her free time.



*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Professor Grubbly-Plank was very knowledgeable and skilful in the field of [[Magizoology]]. Her knowledge and expertise in her field meant she was appointed replacement Professor at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] at least twice and passed [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s Ministry of Magic inspection. She was also considered a highly competent teacher by both Umbridge and students, many of whom considered her a superior teacher to Hagrid.
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': She was skilled in healing magic to at least a reasonable degree, as she was able to heal [[Harry Potter]]'s pet [[owl]] [[Hedwig]] when she was injured, presumably using magical means.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': She was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], a highly advanced piece of [[magic]] and a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability given the immense difficulty of casting the charm.


*Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actress [[Apple Brook]] in .
*In the final cut of the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|film]], she only appears in the background of one scene and has no dialogue parts. It is possible that more scenes with her were filmed; however, this has never been confirmed.
