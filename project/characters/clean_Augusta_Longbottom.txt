'''Augusta Longbottom''' (b. pre [[1947]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and member of the [[Longbottom family]] through marriage. She was the mother of famous [[Auror]] [[Frank Longbottom]], mother-in-law to Auror [[Alice Longbottom]], and grandmother to [[Neville Longbottom]]. Through Neville's marriage, she has a granddaughter-in-law, [[Hannah Abbott|Hannah Longbottom]].





Little is known about Augusta's early life except that she may have had at least one sibling. In her school years she failed her [[Charms (class)|Charms]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]], causing her to later label it a "soft option." It's likely that Augusta went to school with Minerva McGonagall and attended under [[Headmaster]] [[Armando Dippet|Dippet]]. It is also noted that she wanted her grandson to take [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], implying that while in school, she did well in that subject.

At some point, Augusta married [[Frank Longbottom's father|Mr Longbottom]], a [[wizardkind|wizard]]. They had at least one child, a son, [[Frank Longbottom|Frank]].

In [[1947]], Neville's "granddad" (most likely Mr Longbottom) put a [[fanged gerbil]] in Augusta's handbag as a prank, causing her to always keep a mousetrap inside it from that point onward. At some point Mr Longbottom died and his grandson was witness to it. 



 to start his magical education]]

During the [[First Wizarding War]], Augusta's son [[Frank Longbottom|Frank]] was both an [[Auror]] and a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], as was his wife [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]]. The highly respected couple survived the war, but shortly after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s defeat in 1981, they were attacked by [[Death Eaters]] who tortured them into insanity with the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. The couple had to be institutionalised, and their infant son [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] was placed into Augusta's care.

Augusta was clearly strict with her grandson, who she initially feared was a [[Squib]]. Even after Neville proved to be a wizard, his grandmother was stern and demanding of him, sending him [[Howler]]s when his behaviour displeased her and pressuring him to uphold the "family honour." She often took Neville to visit his incapacitated parents at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], stating that he should be proud of their sacrifice.


 on Christmas]]

In [[1995]], Augusta supported [[Harry Potter]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]] when they claimed that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned to power, as did Neville. Her support even led her to stop subscribing to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', due to the newspaper's [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|vicious smear campaign]] against Harry and Dumbledore. When she found out that Neville has not told anyone of his parents' condition, whilst visiting [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungos]] with him at [[Christmas]], she was furious at him for thinking he was ashamed and told Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] about it. Sternness soon turned to pride, as she finally became proud of Neville after his involvement in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].



In [[1997]], after [[Death Eaters]] had taken control of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], Neville was one of the leaders of the student rebellion against [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. In an attempt to force Neville to be more cooperative, [[Auror]] [[John Dawlish]] was ordered to capture Augusta and take her hostage to ensure Neville's behaviour. Augusta, however, put up a fight, which Dawlish wasn't expecting; according to Neville, she put Dawlish in St Mungo's. After this, Augusta went on the run.

She later re-emerged at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] to assist Neville when he called everyone to arms against the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] army. She was the last to come through the secret passageway between the [[Hog's Head]] and the [[Room of Requirement]], so sealed it to prevent any [[Death Eaters]] from breaching the school, as [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] was no longer protecting it. Augusta expressed great pride in her grandson for following in his parents' footsteps.

Little is known of Augusta's life after the war. Her grandson Neville eventually married [[Hannah Abbott]] and took up a position as [[Professor]] of [[Herbology]] at Hogwarts.


Augusta Longbottom was described as a formidable looking witch. She was tall, thin and bony. She commonly wore a hat with a stuffed vulture on it and carried a bright red handbag.


Augusta Longbottom was a severe woman who frequently claimed that her grandson, Neville, lacked the talents that his parents had possessed. She was angry when she realised Neville had never told anyone about why he lived with her, thinking that he was ashamed of his parents. Nevertheless, Augusta grew proud of her grandson after discovering how dedicated he was to defeating Lord Voldemort. She was civil towards [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] when she met them in St Mungo's. She also showed a love for her son and daughter-in-law, even after they were driven insane, treating Alice with gentle kindness when she gave her son a sweet wrapper. 

She might be somewhat biased towards what she is proud of, as she found her grandson's initial lack of talent as a failure of inheriting his father's prestige, and looked down on the idea of Neville studying [[Charms (class)|charms class]], simply because she failed her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in this subject herself, and instead favoured [[Transfiguration (class)|transfiguration]], most likely due to her own skill and success in it.

She seemed to have a very strong judgement of morality, as she chose to believe Harry and [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s honest claims that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had [[Return of Lord Voldemort|returned]] over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry's]] incredibly biased and dishonest denial. She even ceased her subscription of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' in angry protest for backing the Ministry's [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|campaign to antagonise the truth]].

Despite her elderly age (as Neville described her as a "little old witch, living alone"), she showed tremendous loyalty, bravery and logical thinking, as she easily and swiftly defeated the much younger [[Auror]] [[John Dawlish]] who was holding her hostage and fled, and participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] without fear nor hesitancy.


Augusta Longbottom was considered a highly talented and powerful [[Wizardkind|witch]]. Much of her skill lay in [[martial magic]] and she was a highly formidable [[Duelling|duellist]], capable of overpowering [[Death Eaters]] and the [[Auror]] [[John Dawlish]] who where much younger than her. Augusta's age did not interfere with her magical abilities, in a similar fashion with [[Minerva McGonagall]], and both witches survived the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] when much younger witches and wizards perished. Despite the fact that she failed her [[Charms (class)|Charms]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L]], Augusta must have been proficient enough in the various protective enchantments needed to survive whilst she was on the run. It is also probable that she was good with [[Transfiguration]], as she was very insistent with her grandson taking the [[Transfiguration (class)|subject]] at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Despite her old age, Augusta Longbottom was an incredibly skilled duellist who the Death Eaters severely underestimated, as she easily defeated and injured [[John Dawlish]], a highly trained and skilled Auror, badly enough to result in him to be sent to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], although Dawlish had not been fighting at full potency from having become "punch drunk" from being the favourite punching bag of the Order of the Phoenix. She also bravely participated in and survived the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], likely defeating many Death Eaters in process, showing her proficiency with [[martial magic]]. 




, her only grandchild]]
Augusta was the guardian of Neville and raised him from a young age. During the early years of Neville's life, Augusta often thought that Neville was a [[Squib]] and was afraid he would not get into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She was extremely proud when he did but it was apparent that Augusta placed high expectations on Neville and was yet to be certain that he had substantial power.

Augusta often reprimanded her grandson and sent Neville a [[Howler]] on at least two occasions. She pushed Neville to be like his parents by doing well in school, especially in [[Transfiguration]] (a class Neville hated). However, Neville loved Augusta and she cared a great deal for him, however stern she could be.

In later years, she became proud of Neville as she realised how excellent a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and moral person he was. She was shown commenting in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' about his powers and during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], she was proud to fight alongside him. After the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]] Neville married Hannah Abbott though it is unknown whether they had any children. Neville also replaced [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] as the [[Herbology]] professor at Hogwarts, which would have truly made his grandmother proud.



 and [[Alice Longbottom]] holding infant Neville]]
It is unknown what her relationship with Frank and Alice was before they were [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]], but it must have been fairly close as Augusta was chosen to raise their infant son after they were no longer able to. After the [[Attack on Frank and Alice Longbottom|attack]], Mrs Longbottom seemed to [[love]] her son and daughter-in-law, often taking Neville to visit them at [[St Mungo's]] and was most likely devastated when they were driven mad. 

However, at times, she seemed to tire of providing for them, as she sounded weary when speaking to Alice and advised Neville to throw away a gum wrapper Alice gave him. However, it is assumed that she still cared for them as she obviously respected them and said numerous times that she wanted Neville to be more like them.


Augusta and [[Griselda Marchbanks|Madam Marchbanks]] were described as close friends by Neville Longbottom. Griselda had come for dinner at Mrs Longbottom's many times.



, whom she respected and believed]]
Augusta Longbottom was shown to highly respect Harry Potter and demonstrated this by her support for his and [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s honest claims that Lord Voldemort had indeed [[Return of Lord Voldemort|returned]]. She was truly disgusted by then Ministry of Magic's blatantly dishonest [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|slandering]] of both him and Dumbledore, with her even cancelling her [[Daily Prophet]] subscription over her anger at their publishing of Ministry propaganda. She also showed her admiration for Harry, declaring, according to Neville, that Harry had more bravery than "the whole Ministry of Magic put together".

She also treated Harry very courteously when he, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] were visiting [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungos]]. Furthermore, she demonstrated her loyalty towards Harry and his cause by courageously deciding to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts to defeat Lord Voldemort and his army. 



, whom she was supportive of|alt]]
Augusta Longbottom naturally respected Albus Dumbledore, considering that she allowed both her son and daughter-in-law to join the [[Order of the Phoenix]] that Dumbledore led out of obvious trust of Dumbledore's leadership and despite Alice and Frank becoming insane for their reputation as members of the Order, Augusta remained as respectful and loyal to Dumbledore as ever, showing she never blamed him for having failed to protect them. 

Augusta was utterly disgusted by then Ministry of Magic's blatantly dishonest slandering of Dumbledore and quickly cancelled her Daily Prophet subscription over her anger at them publishing Ministry propaganda. Augusta likely was devastated when Albus died and attended his funeral and would prove her loyalty to the great wizard by courageously fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts.


''Augusta'' is a Latin name and the feminine form of ''Augustus'', meaning "great" or "venerable," derived from the Latin verb ''augere'', "to increase." Augustus was the name given to the first emperor of Rome, and subsequently [[Wikipedia:Augusta|Augusta]] was sometimes used as a title for empresses of the Roman and Byzantine empires.


 as Augusta Longbottom]]
*The 2006 short film  includes a reference to Neville's grandfather, and describes a joke he played on Augusta in [[1947]] involving her handbag and a [[fanged gerbil]], which led her to keep a mousetrap in her bag thereafter.
*Augusta was played by [[Leila Hoffman]] in , as she was faintly seen escorting Neville to the Hogwarts Express.

*[[Ninette Finch]] was cast as Augusta in .; however, she only appears in the background of some battle sequences. In a similar case to [[Apple Brook]]'s cameo as Professor Grubbly-Plank, it is possible that more scenes with her were filmed; however, this has never been proven.
**On [[12 April]] [[2022]], [[The Rowling Library]] released official photos of ''Ninette'', behind the scenes on the set of .
