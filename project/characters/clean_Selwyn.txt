'''Selwyn''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[pure-blood]] and a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] who fought in the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Selwyn fought in several battles, including the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. He also fought at the [[Ambush at the Lovegood House]], along with [[Travers]].



Selwyn was one of the many [[Death Eaters]] who fought in the [[Second Wizarding War]] upon pledging his loyalty to Tom Riddle.

Battle of the Seven Potters
Selwyn participated in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], and chased [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and the real [[Harry Potter]]. Towards the end of the chase, he was ordered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] to surrender his [[wand]] when [[Lucius Malfoy]]'s was destroyed by Harry's [[Harry Potter's wand|wand]]. Harry and Hagrid however were able to escape, likely sparing Selwyn's wand from being destroyed.

Ambush at the Lovegood House
In early [[1998]], Selwyn travelled with [[Travers]] to [[Xenophilius Lovegood]]'s [[Lovegood House|house]]. Lovegood had been printing articles in ''[[The Quibbler]]'' urging the public to support Harry Potter, and his daughter [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]] was taken to control his behaviour. Lovegood [[Ambush at the Lovegood House|alerted the Death Eaters]] when [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] came to his home, hoping that they would return his daughter, if he handed over Harry. However, as Selwyn and Travers arrived, the [[Erumpent]] horn in the residence blew up, giving Harry, Hermione, and Ron a chance to hide. Selwyn beat up and tortured Lovegood, suspicious that the wizard had been lying, but Hermione then engineered the trio's escape so that the Death Eaters saw Harry before they [[Apparition|disapparated]]. Afterwards, Selwyn and Travers arrested Lovegood.


Little is known about Selwyn's appearance; it is, however, known that he had a rough voice. As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm, which had faded to a mere scar upon Voldemort's death.


Being a Death Eater, Selwyn was a cruel character; he assaulted [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] when he called him and [[Travers]], thinking that he wanted to entrap them. He also threatened Xenophilius that he would kill or mutilate his daughter, [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], if he did not obey their commands. He was also quite suspicious, as he believed that Xenophilius wanted to entrap and kill him and Travers.


*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': As a loyal Death Eater and servant of the Dark Lord Voldemort, Selwyn would have been highly proficient in dark magic and an accomplished [[Dark Wizard]]. He was probably talented in the casting of various [[dark charm]]s, as he likely used dark magic on [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] when he thought the man had tried to lure himself and Travers into a trap.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Being a Death Eater, Selwyn would have been accomplished in [[martial magic]] and combat. He fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], for which he chased down [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and [[Harry Potter]] on a broomstick, meaning he would have been a fairly competent duellist.
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Selwyn was an accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer, as he participated in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] in [[1997]], where he was able to successfully keep up with [[Sirius Black's motorcycle|Sirius Black's flying motorbike]] and dodge everything [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and [[Harry Potter]] sent at him.


*'''[[Selwyn's wand|Wand]]''': Selwyn owned a [[wand]], which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[wand core]]. He used his wand whilst fighting during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], during which [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] demanded he take his wand to [[curse]] [[Harry Potter]], before he escaped. However, as Harry escaped, this would have saved his wand from imminent destruction. He possibly purchased it from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]], [[London]], along with most wizards in [[Great Britain]].


*When Harry, Ron, and Hermione [[Infiltration of the British Ministry of Magic (1997)|infiltrated]] the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[1997]], [[Dolores Umbridge]] mentioned that the [[Selwyn family|Selwyns]] were an old [[pure-blood]] family, and claimed to be related to them; however, this was almost certainly a lie since her father was [[Orford Umbridge]], a janitor whom she found too embarrassing for him to be related the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]], and her mother was the muggle [[Ellen Cracknell]].
*Selwyn may have been [[Hedwig's killer]], as he was one of the Death Eaters pursuing Harry and Hagrid at the time.
