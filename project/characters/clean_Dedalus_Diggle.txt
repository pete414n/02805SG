'''Dedalus Diggle''' (fl. [[1964]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], who fought in the [[First Wizarding War|First]] and the [[Second Wizarding War]] against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the [[Death Eaters]]. He was a member of the [[Advance Guard]] in [[1995]] and he fought in several battles of both wars. He also escorted the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] to a safe place in [[1997]].



Dedalus was born in [[1964]] or earlier into a wizarding family.


Dedalus lived in [[Kent]] and never had much sense, according to [[Minerva McGonagall]]. He became a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation led and founded by [[Albus Dumbledore]], in order to oppose [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. He was thought to have been responsible for a downpour of shooting stars in [[Kent]] to celebrate the downfall of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], an act that was deemed foolish and irresponsibly by [[Minerva McGonagall]].

Dedalus was presumably one of the members of the Order of the Phoenix assigned to discreetly keep a close eye on [[Harry Potter]] seen as he once met The Boy Who Lived during his early childhood in a shop. He bowed to Harry, for which his [[Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] furiously interrogated him as to how Diggle knew him and why Harry deserved that kind of respect.

He met Harry formally on the day [[Rubeus Hagrid]] first brought Harry into the [[Leaky Cauldron]] on their way to purchase school supplies, and shook his hand about five times.

Diggle rejoined the Order to fight in the [[Second Wizarding War]], after Lord Voldemort's [[Return of Lord Voldemort|rebirth]]. In [[1995]], Diggle was part of the Advance Guard escorting Harry from [[4 Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] to [[12 Grimmauld Place]], along with fellow members [[Remus Lupin]], [[Alastor Moody]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Sturgis Podmore]], [[Hestia Jones]], [[Elphias Doge]], and [[Emmeline Vance]].

The Dursleys' departure

Diggle, along with [[Hestia Jones]], was assigned by the [[Order of the Phoenix]] to manage the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]]' departure from [[4 Privet Drive|Privet Drive]]. When he and [[Hestia Jones]] arrived, he greeted the Dursleys as "''Harry Potter's relatives''", something that annoyed [[Vernon Dursley]]. In an attempt to make conversation, he also commented that all the knobs and buttons in a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] car would confuse him. He also sported a large [[Dedalus Diggle's pocket watch|pocket watch]] kept in his waistcoat that shouted at him to "''Hurry up!''" when late.

His house was [[Attack at Dedalus Diggle's house|burned down]] by [[Death Eaters]] after the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic]], in an attempt to harm members of the Order. Diggle was not present, as he was in hiding with Hestia and the Dursleys.


Diggle was described as a tiny, excitable man who often wore a purple [[top hat]].


Diggle was a person who was often very cheerful, enthusiastic and friendly. He was excited when he learned about Voldemort's downfall, and he very much admired Harry Potter. He also thought that he would flatter [[Vernon Dursley]] by telling that it was very clever to drive, and that he could not drive a car, however, this simply angered Vernon. Diggle also thought that he and [[Hestia Jones]] would be best friends with the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]], showing he was a very friendly and good-natured wizard, but also perhaps somewhat naive, as he did not expect the Dursleys to be as unpleasant as they really were. He was also perhaps somewhat clumsy and careless, as Minerva McGonagall told Albus Dumbledore she never thought he had much common sense, when telling Dumbledore she believed him to be responsible for causing a downfall of shooting stars across Kent, a feat which was witnessed by Muggles and regarded as highly unusual.


*'''[[Magic]]al aptitude''': It is likely that Dedalus Diggle was a fairly talented [[Wizardkind|wizard]], having become a loyal member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and survived the [[First Wizarding War]], in which he actively participated in the efforts to free the [[Wizarding world|magical community]] from the grasp of the [[Dark Arts|Dark Forces]] under [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s command. He was presumably also a very capable [[Duelling|duellist]], having survived that long. It was also widely thought of that he was responsible for magically causing a downfall of shooting stars across [[Kent]] celebrating Voldemort's defeat in early [[November]] [[1981]], an act both considered impressive but also irresponsible by other wizards, particularly [[Minerva McGonagall]].
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Dedalus was well versed in defensive magic, with him authoring an article for the wizarding magazine [[Spellbound (magazine)|''Spellbound'']] on the subject of [[Counter-jinxes]]. Years later, this article helped [[Calamity Investigator]]s of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] in addressing the [[Calamity]] by teaching them how to more effectively break through the defences of their magical adversaries.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Dedalus was capable of producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]], a highly advanced piece of magic and a mark of superior magical ability.
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Dedalus was an accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer; he was a member of the [[Advance Guard]] who successfully escorted Harry Potter to 12 Grimmauld Place via broomstick flight.


*'''[[Wand]]''': Diggle owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]].
*'''[[Top hat]]''': Dedalus owned a mauve top hat, which he wore as a member of the [[Advance Guard]].
*'''[[Dedalus Diggle's pocket watch|Pocket watch]]''': Diggle owned a [[magic]]al pocket watch that was capable of speech, which would inform him of his schedule when he was running late.
*'''[[Dedalus Diggle's house|House]]''': Diggle owned a house somewhere in [[Kent]], [[England]]. In [[1997]], it was [[Attack at Dedalus Diggle's house|broken into and burned down]] by [[Death Eaters]].



]]
After learning that Voldemort had lost his powers, Diggle widely admired [[Harry Potter]], because he was the reason of Voldemort's downfall. He also once bowed to Harry in a shop sometime in Harry's childhood, but Harry didn't know who he was and why he bowed to him.

Harry officially met Diggle in [[1991]], at the [[Leaky Cauldron]]. He was surprised when Harry told that he remembered him. Diggle was also a member of the Advance Guard, a group of members of the Order that came to escort Harry from [[4 Privet Drive]] to [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. He got angry when [[Remus Lupin]] attempted to introduce Diggle to Harry, as they had already met. Diggle met Harry again in [[1997]], when he and [[Hestia Jones]] came to rescue the Dursleys from Death Eaters.


[[Albus Dumbledore]] knew Diggle through the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. They probably fought along in several battles, and, after Voldemort's first defeat, Diggle was excited. When [[Minerva McGonagall]] disapproved Diggle's behaviour (because she thought that he could be seen by [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]), Dumbledore justified him, telling that "We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years." Dumbledore and Diggle also fought along in the [[Second Wizarding War]]. It is unknown how Diggle reacted when he learned about Dumbledore's death.

Diggle first met the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]], a Muggle family, in [[1997]]. Diggle, along with fellow member of the Order [[Hestia Jones]], went to the Dursleys' house to help them hide from [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his Death Eaters. [[Vernon Dursley]] was a Muggle who disliked wizards and magic in general.

Diggle attempted to flatter Vernon by telling him that he was very clever for being able to drive, and that he himself could never drive a car. That made Vernon very angry, saying that "he didn't know even how to drive!" Despite this, Diggle thought that he and the Dursleys would be best friends. It is unknown what happened after their departure. However, it is possible, though unlikely, that they became friendly after that.

Diggle possibly knew all the members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], and had a good relationship with [[Harry Potter]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]], as well as other members.

He appears to have had a good relationship with fellow members [[Remus Lupin]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Alastor Moody]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Elphias Doge]], [[Sturgis Podmore]], [[Emmeline Vance]], and [[Hestia Jones]], as they were all members of the [[Advance Guard]] in [[1995]].However, when Remus Lupin introduced Diggle to Harry Potter, Diggle got angry, saying that they had already met. Diggle and Hestia Jones were also the ones who helped the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] hide from [[Death Eaters]] in [[1997]].

Emmeline Vance was killed by Death Eaters in [[1996]], as were [[Alastor Moody]] in [[1997]], and [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] in [[1998]]. It is unknown how Diggle reacted when he learned of their deaths.

[[Minerva McGonagall]] disapproved of Diggle's excited behaviour after Voldemort's first defeat, but Albus Dumbledore justified him, telling that the wizards had years to celebrate something. Minerva and Diggle were both members of the second [[Order of the Phoenix]] and fought in several battles.



Dedalus may be a spelling variant of "Daedalus", who was a craftsman and inventor in [[Greece|Greek]] mythology that notably built wings of wax and feathers for himself and his son, Icarus.

Diggle, as a surname, is from a [[medieval]] diminutive of ''[[wiktionary:Dick#English|Dick]]''.
