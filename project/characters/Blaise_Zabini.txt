{{Quote|Yeah, Zabini, because you're so talented... at posing....|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]'s low opinion of Blaise|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

'''Blaise Zabini''' (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]<ref name="HBP7"/> and a student in [[Harry Potter]]'s year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into the [[Slytherin]] house,<ref name="PS7">{{PS|B|7}}</ref> and was on friendly terms with multiple fellow Slytherins, including [[Draco Malfoy]] and his [[Draco Malfoy's gang|gang]], as well as [[Pansy Parkinson]].<ref name="HBP7"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Blaise Zabini was the son of a [[Blaise Zabini's mother|famously beautiful witch]] who had been widowed [[seven]] times over by [[1996]]. Each [[Blaise Zabini's mother's seven husbands|husband]]'s [[death]] occurred both under suspicious circumstances and left the already wealthy Ms. Zabini and her son with more money. Blaise was incredibly vain as a child and did not befriend [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] or [[Blood traitor]]s.<ref name="HBP7"/>

===Hogwarts years {{Comment|1991-1998}}===
====Early years====
In [[1991]], Blaise started his [[magic]]al education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was the last student to be [[Sorting Hat|Sorted]] in his [[first year]] and was Sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].<ref name="PS7"/> Due to Blaise's reserved nature, he kept to himself most of the time and did not really make friends with other [[Slytherin]]s, nor other students in his year — though this may have been because he was prejudiced against [[Muggle-born]]s and "[[blood traitor]]s." Blaise seemed to get along with [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Vincent Crabbe]], [[Gregory Goyle]], and [[Pansy Parkinson]] — he was willing to sit with them on the train journey to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] — but other than that, he was not mentioned to be hanging around that group.<ref name="HBP7"/> 

====Sixth year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Pansy Parkinson|Even you think she's good looking, don't you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!|Blaise|I wouldn't touch a filthy blood traitor like her whatever she looked like.|Pansy and Blaise discussing [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]'s appearance|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-blaise.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Pansy Parkinson and Blaise sitting on the Hogwarts' Express]]

Blaise was one of the students who received an invitation from Professor [[Horace Slughorn]] for lunch on the [[Hogwarts Express]] journey, which might imply that none of Blaise's relatives were Death Eaters, as Slughorn wanted nothing to do with them (it was the reason why he chose not to invite [[Theodore Nott]] to join the Club). Slughorn was sizing up the student body for potential new members of his famous [[Slug Club]], which he started when he last taught at Hogwarts.<ref name="HBP7"/>

During the meeting Blaise seemed quiet as usual and did not join in the discussions. However, he did give a little cough of "amused scepticism" when [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]] told the group that he thought [[Harry Potter]] had powers beyond the ordinary. This caused him to provoke Ginny Weasley to snap at him, and Slughorn jokingly warned Blaise not to annoy Ginny, remembering how well she could cast a [[Bat-Bogey Hex]]. When questioned on his family, Blaise talked about his mother and the line of husbands she had who had all left her large amounts of [[galleon]]s in their wills after their suspicious deaths.<ref name="HBP7"/>

[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-slug_club_dinner.jpg|245x245px|thumb|Blaise at a Slug Club meeting with Professor Slughorn and [[Marcus Belby]]]]

After the lunch meeting ended, Blaise retired to his compartment on the Hogwarts Express in which [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Vincent Crabbe]], [[Gregory Goyle]], and [[Pansy Parkinson]] were also sitting. Harry Potter followed Blaise back to this compartment under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility cloak]] in an attempt to hear Draco's conversation, and give him some perspective as to what Draco had been planning over the summer.<ref name="HBP7"/> Once they arrived at Hogwarts, Blaise apparently passed the litmus test that Slughorn had set, as he continued to receive invitations to Slughorn's parties after the school year began.<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref> He did not seem to have a high opinion of his fellow members, if his comments to [[Draco Malfoy]] on the train were any indication, but, in spite of this, he continued to accept the invitations. He did not appear to have a high opinion of Draco either.<ref name="HBP7">{{HBP|B|7}}</ref>

During his [[sixth year]], Blaise took [[Potions (class)|Potions]] as a [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] class,<ref name="HBP9"/><ref name="HBP18">{{HBP|B|18}}</ref> and played as [[Chaser]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]].<ref name="HBPF"/> He also on at least one occasion went to the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] in Hogsmeade, where the [[trio]] noticed him lolling against a pillar there.<ref name="HBP12">{{HBP|B|12}}</ref>

====Seventh year====
[[File:Slytherins battle.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Blaise with fellow Slytherins in the Great Hall]]
Blaise attended his [[seventh year]] at Hogwarts.<ref name="DHF1"/><ref name="DHF2"/> It can be assumed that his time under the Carrows regime was not as trying as others, as he was a [[Slytherin]] and not a [[Muggle-born]]. Blaise was present on the [[Hogwarts Express]] when the [[Death Eaters]] [[Raid on the Hogwarts Express|raided]] it looking for Harry Potter.<ref name="DHF1">{{DH|F1}}</ref>

When evacuation started moments before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on [[2 May]], [[1998]], Blaise presumably left with the other [[Slytherin]]s through the passageway to [[Hog's Head Inn]] in [[Room of Requirement]].<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref> Given how he presumably did not fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, along with most of Slytherin, he would have survived the [[Second Wizarding War]], but what happened to him later in life is unknown.

==Physical appearance==
Blaise was a tall, black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes. He was described as attractive, and also was vain about the attractive looks in question.<ref name="HBP7"/>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused scepticism.|Blaise showing contempt towards [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Blaise seemed to be a highly arrogant individual, who looked down on nearly everyone and everything. He rarely expressed his often disdainful opinions in a confrontational manner, and preferred to simply scoff or show disbelief when someone said something he disagreed with. This was shown when he reacted with scornful amusement when [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] praised Harry Potter's power. When warned not to anger [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] (who insulted Blaise's vanity) he also reacted with contempt.<ref name="HBP7"/> He also insulted most of his fellow [[Slug Club]] members and the parties themselves, though he continued to attend the meetings. He also did not seem to respect [[Draco Malfoy]] very much.<ref name="HBP7"/>

Blaise was prejudiced against [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], [[Muggle-born]]s, and those who were accepting of them. This was made clear when [[Pansy Parkinson]] accused him of finding Ginny attractive. Blaise in response said he would never touch "''a filthy [[blood traitor]] like her''". However, he also did not seem to hold a high opinion of followers of Voldemort, as he taunted Draco on his father being outed as a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. It seemed he was so arrogant that he was more or less indifferent and dismissive of everyone, regardless of status.<ref name="HBP7"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
[[File:Blaizezabiniquidditch.JPG|150px|thumb|Blaise playing [[Quidditch]] for Slytherin]]
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Blaise was proficient in potion-making, considering he was one of the few students that progressed to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level in his [[sixth year]] (1996-97) in [[Potions (class)|Potions]].<ref name="HBP9">{{HBP|B|9}}</ref> He achieved either an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' or an '[[Outstanding]]' on his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam.
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': By his sixth year, Blaise had joined the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], playing as a [[Chaser]], showing him to have been an accomplished and skilled [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player.<ref name="HBPF">{{HBP|F}} - Chapter 13 (''Felix Felicis'')</ref>

==Etymology==
*Blaise is a French name derived from the Latin ''blaesus'', "lisping".<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/blaise Behind the Name: Blaise]</ref> In mythology Blaise was the tutor and, later, biographer, of Merlin - which makes this an appropriate name for a wizard. Another famous bearer was {{wplink|Blaise Pascal}}, a French mathematician and philosopher. Also, {{wplink|Blaise Castle}} is an eighteenth-century mansion house and estate in Bristol, England called "the finest place in England" in Jane Austen's ''Northanger Abbey''.
*The surname Zabini is Italian and Portuguese. Blaise may be of Italian or African descent, given that the East African country of Mozambique, whose official language remains Portuguese, was under Portuguese colonial rule from the fifteenth century until 1975.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Hp72_0857.jpg|240px|thumb|[[Draco Malfoy]] and Blaise Zabini hanging on for dear life with the Fiendfyre below them]]
[[File:BlaiseLEGOHP.png|140px|thumb|Blaise Zabini as depicted in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]
*Blaise is portrayed by [[Louis Cordice]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film]] [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|adaptations]] of {{HBP}} and {{DH}}.<ref name="IMDB">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2857909/ Internet Movie Database]</ref> He appears in several scenes and has one line in the film.
*Because the name Blaise is gender-neutral, Blaise's gender and nature were hotly debated in fan forums for many years, and both male and female versions of the character were heavily featured in fanfiction. This was mostly due to the indeterminate nature of Blaise's character in canon and lack of further explanation on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s part until it was revealed in {{HBP}} that he was male.<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/news_view.cfm?id=80 J.K. Rowling's Official Site: News]</ref>
*The Dutch edition of {{PS}} actually turned Blaise into a female character, by translating his name into Bella when he appears at the sorting ceremony. When the Dutch translation of [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|''Half-Blood Prince'']] was released, the character was renamed to the masculine Benno, correcting this mistake.
**However, the Hebrew translation described Blaise as a female in the 1st book, and then as male in the 6th book, making a contradiction.
*In {{HBP|FA}}, Blaise plays as a [[Chaser]] on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], which is not mentioned or depicted in the book (however, this does not mean this information is not [[canon]]).
*In {{DH|F2}}, Blaise is present in the [[Skirmish at the Room of Requirement|fight]] in the [[Room of Requirement]] in place of [[Vincent Crabbe]], whose [[Jamie Waylett|actor]] was dropped from the films following his conviction for possession of cannabis. Zabini essentially takes Goyle's place in the film while Goyle takes Crabbe's place and is the one to be killed by Fiendfyre.
*Given his surname and his ethnicity, it is likely that Zabini is of (at least partial) Italian and African descent.
