{{Quote|...there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related.... A pity that the same cannot be said for you. ''‘Parents professions: greengrocers’''.|[[Dolores Umbridge]] during [[Mary Cattermole]]'s trial|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
The '''mother''' of [[Mary Cattermole]] was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[greengrocer]], as was her [[Mary Cattermole's father|husband]].

Their daughter was a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who eventually married [[Reginald Cattermole]] and had three children. Her [[blood status]] got her into trouble with the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] in [[1997]], when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was in control of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. On her questionnaire, she mentioned her parents' professions, which was inadvisable, as it made it extremely obvious to the unsympathetic regime at the time that she had no [[magic]]al blood ancestry. Fortunately, Mary was saved by [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].
