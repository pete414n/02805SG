{{Dialogue a-b-c|Harry Potter|Bathilda Bagshot? The author of ''A History of Magic''?|Elphias Doge|Yes. A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus's.|Aunt Muriel|Quite gaga these days, I've heard.|Bathilda's failing mental health|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

'''Professor Bathilda Bagshot''' (d. [[1997]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], [[magic]]al historian and the author of ''[[A History of Magic]]'' and approximately [[Bathilda Bagshot's books|ten other books]]. ''A History of Magic'' is used in the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] [[History of Magic|class]] of the same name, taught by [[Cuthbert Binns]]. 

She lived in [[Godric's Hollow]], and was murdered around [[December]], [[1997]]. Her corpse was then animated by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] to contain his pet [[snake]] [[Nagini]]. This was intended to be a trap for [[Harry Potter]].

Bathilda was also the great-aunt of [[Gellert Grindelwald]], the infamous [[Dark Wizard]] who was defeated by [[Albus Dumbledore]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Professor Bagshot was born to the wizarding [[Bagshot family]] sometime in the early or mid [[19th century|nineteenth century]]. She had at least one sister or one brother.

===The Dumbledores===
{{Quote| ''Kendra Dumbledore'' slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes. The first year they were there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn't have known there was a daughter if I hadn't been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn't know what to make of it.|Bathilda relays her reminiscences about the [[Dumbledore family|Dumbledores]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
In the [[1890s]], Bagshot was already an adult living in [[Bathilda Bagshot's home|her house]] in [[Godric's Hollow]], when [[Kendra Dumbledore]] moved there from [[Mould-on-the-Wold]] along with her young children [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]], [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], and [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], after her husband [[Percival Dumbledore|Percival]]'s well-publicised arrest and imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. Bathilda tried to befriend Kendra after they arrived, but she was rebuffed.

Within the next several years, Bathilda sent an owl to Albus Dumbledore (then a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student) having been favourably impressed by his paper on [[Cross-Species Transfiguration|trans-species Transfiguration]] for the scholarly journal ''[[Transfiguration Today]]''. This initial contact led to her being acquainted with the rest of the [[Dumbledore family]]. At the time of Kendra's death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric's Hollow who was on speaking terms with her.

[[File:BathildaBagshot1947.jpg|200px|thumb|Bathilda's picture on her book, ''[[A History of Magic]]'']]
In the summer of [[1899]], after Albus Dumbledore graduated from Hogwarts, an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda's great-nephew, [[Gellert Grindelwald]], came to live with her and she made a point of introducing Grindelwald to Albus. The two talented young men became friends.

In [[1947]], Bathilda's work on wizarding history was published under the title ''A History of Magic'' by [[Little Red Books]]. It was presumably around this time she authored her [[Bathilda Bagshot's books|other works on magical history]]. She was deemed the most celebrated magical historian of the [[20th century|twentieth century]].

Bathilda may have been a teacher at some point, possibly at Hogwarts, as [[Hermione Granger]] referred to her as "Professor Bagshot" when referencing her work.

===Later years===
{{Quote|We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who has always been sweet to us, and who dotes on Harry... Bathilda drops in most days, she's a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore, I'm not sure he'd be pleased if he knew! I don't know how much to believe, actually, because it seems incredible that Dumbledore could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind's going, personally!|Excerpt from Lily Potter's [[Lily Evans's letter|letter]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:BathildaWithAcademics.png|200px|thumb|left|Bathilda Bagshot with other academics at [[Hogwarts Castle]]]]
In her older years, Bathilda was on close terms with [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]] and even spoke to the younger woman on the closeness between [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] and Dumbledore, though Lily remained somewhat sceptical, given Bathilda's advancing age and possible senility. Bathilda was also the only one to join the [[Potter family|Potters]] during [[Harry Potter's first birthday|Harry Potter's birthday tea]] when he turned one year old. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s great aunt [[Muriel]] called her "gaga" during Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding.

Also sometime in her later life, Professor Bagshot provided a quote for the critical acclaim for {{QTA}} by [[Kennilworthy Whisp]], when she wrote "''Kennilworthy Whisp's painstaking research has uncovered a veritable treasure trove of hitherto unknown facts about the sport of warlocks. A fascinating read.''" as a review.

====Rita Skeeter interview====
{{Quote|Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here's a copy of the book; hope you like it. You said everything, even if you don't remember it. Rita.|Rita Skeeter's note to Bathilda|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-bathilda cottage.jpg|250px|thumb|right|"Bathilda" stumbling around her cottage, sometime after her interview with [[Rita Skeeter]]]]
In [[1997]] (after the death of [[Albus Dumbledore]]) Bathilda was interviewed by Rita Skeeter through the use of [[Veritaserum]]. Rita then used the material she gathered from Bathilda in her only semi-true biography ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]''. It is implied that Skeeter took advantage of Bathilda's poor mental state to twist her material to be more sensationalist. She even referred to Bathilda as being "batty".

[[File:DH1 Rita Skeeter's note to Bathilda Bagshot.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Rita Skeeter's note to Bathilda after her interview]]
Also while in Bathilda's cottage she took several of her pictures and letters. For example an image of Dumbledore and Grindlewald together. And one letter she stole was a correspondence from Dumbledore to [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindlewald]], regarding their ambition to obtain the [[Deathly Hallows]] and their plan to start a global revolution. This global revolution would lead [[wizardkind]] out of hiding and cause Muggle servitude. Bathilda's pictures and letters caused tension in the wizarding world, especially among those whom were Dumbledore supporters. Harry Potter was one of the ones most affected by it.

===Death and post-mortem===
{{Quote|Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric's Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic.|[[Lee Jordan]] comments upon Bathilda's murder|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Bathilda Bagshot and Harry Potter.jpg|250px|thumb|Nagini as Bathilda Bagshot speaking to Harry Potter in [[Parseltongue]]]]
Sometime after her interview with Rita Skeeter, Bathilda was murdered through the [[Dark Arts]] and her body was animated by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort did this using his snake, [[Nagini]]. He left Nagini in her cottage as a trap, reasoning that [[Harry Potter]] may visit Godric's Hollow to see his parents' grave and their destroyed home, since he was no longer at Hogwarts and had never before had the opportunity to visit Godric’s Hollow.

[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-bathilda corpse.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Nagini preparing to leave Bathilda's corpse and detain Harry Potter]]
On the following Christmas Eve, [[Hermione Granger]] and Harry did so, thinking that perhaps Dumbledore had left [[Godric Gryffindor's Sword]] there for them to be able to destroy the Horcruxes they were hunting. The pair met the possessed woman and were almost captured when "Bathilda" lured them into her home. After determining Harry's identity, Nagini leapt from Bathilda's body to [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1997)|attack him]], leaving the old woman for good. The plan, however, failed, and Harry and Hermione escaped.

Bathilda's body was later found, and her death by [[Dark Arts|dark magic]] was reported by ''[[Potterwatch]]''.

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|Now that he was beside her, Harry realised how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint... Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots... she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly through. |Description of her appearance|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}An elderly Professor Bagshot was a tiny woman, her head at the level of seventeen-year-old [[Harry Potter]]'s chest. At the time that Harry Potter met her, she was stooped, her eyes were thick with cataracts, and her hair was scant and white, with her scalp clearly visible. Her face had some liver spots and broken veins.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now dimmed. "The fire's lit, but the cauldron's empty," as [[Ivor Dillonsby]] put it to me, or, in [[Enid Smeek]]'s slightly earthier phrase, "She's nutty as squirrel poo.|''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'' by [[Rita Skeeter]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}Little is known of Bathilda's personality. One can presume she was friendly and amiable, having tried to befriend [[Kendra Dumbledore]] in the 1890s with a batch of homemade [[Cauldron Cake]]s. She regarded [[Albus Dumbledore]] as something like a protégé and was friendly with [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]] in the early 1980s. She was a brilliant witch and historian in her youth, but during her later years she was quite possibly becoming senile.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[History of Magic|Historian]]''': An authority in wizarding history, Professor Bagshot was referred to by some as the most celebrated magical historian of the twentieth century, having authored ''[[A History of Magic]]'' and [[Bathilda Bagshot's books|ten other books]] on the subject.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Professor Bagshot was knowledgeable in transfiguration as she was a reader of the scholarly journal ''[[Transfiguration Today]]'' and had enough understanding in the subject to properly assess the quality of one of [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s papers on the subject of [[Cross-Species Transfiguration|trans-species Transfiguration]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Bathilda appeared to be good with charms, as she was able to successfully use the ''[[Portus]]'' charm to arrange a [[Portkey]] for [[Gellert Grindelwald]] to leave [[Godric's Hollow]].
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Bathilda kept and grew [[magic]]al plants in her back garden, such as [[Plangentine]]s, and knew what the proper time was to pick them.
*'''[[Divination]]''': Bathilda appeared to be skilled and knowledgeable in the art of divination, as she authored two books on the subject, ''[[The Oracle of Palombo]]'' and ''[[Omens, Oracles & the Goat]]''.
*'''[[Author]]ing''': Bathilda was a highly accomplished and renowned author, having written and published multiple books on a number of different magical subjects.
*'''Cooking''': Bathilda was able to bake batches of [[Cauldron Cake]]s in her youth.

==Possessions==
*'''[[Bathilda Bagshot's home|Home]]''': Bathilda owned a dwelling in [[Godric's Hollow]] which served as her home when she was alive. After her death and murder, it fell into disarray and ruin, as no one was around to look after it.
*'''''[[The Mill on the Floss]]''''': Bathilda owned a copy of this novel written by [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] author [[George Eliot]], which could be found on the bookshelves in her home.
*'''''[[Shrubs & Trees for the Garden]]''''': Bathilda owned a copy of this gardening and floriculture book, which could be found on the shelves in her home.
*'''''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]''''': Bathilda was personally gifted a copy of this controversial autobiography by its author [[Rita Skeeter]], after Bathilda personally gave her the information necessary to write it (although somewhat unwillingly).
*'''[[Plangentine]]s''': Bathilda grew and cultivated this species of [[magic]]al plant in her garden.

==Etymology==

*''Bathilda'' is an alternate spelling of the name of [[Wikipedia:Balthild|Saint Balthild]], a seventh-century Anglo-Saxon noble and wife of King Clovis II of Burgundy who dedicated her later life to helping the ill and the poor. The name is derived from the Old English ''Bealdhild'', meaning "bold battle".
*Bathilda is a German name that means "heroine".
*Bagshot is the name of a town in Surrey, England. The name is thought to be derived from a tribe (bacca) and the Anglo-Saxon word for "The place of" (sheatte) meaning "the place of Bacca's tribe" though Bag could also mean badger, "the place of the [[Badger]]", creating a reference to [[Hufflepuff]].
*Bathilda's last name, Bagshot, may also be a reference to ''[[wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings|The Lord of the Rings]]'', in which the characters Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, and Hamfast and Samwise Gamgee lived on Bagshot Row.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Hazel Douglas as Bathilda.jpg|200px|thumb|Hazel Douglas in an on-set interview]]
[[File:Bathilda lego.png|150px|thumb|Bathilda Bagshot as an animated corpse in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]

*[[Hazel Douglas]] portrayed Bathilda Bagshot in {{DH|F1}}.
*It is possible that Bathilda's body was animated as an [[Inferius]], and thus controlled by Voldemort's will. As Inferi are never shown to speak, this would account for why Nagini had to speak for her instead, but this is not necessarily the case because it was stated in the book that [[Nagini]] came out of her.
*Bathilda was incredibly old when she died, as she was a ''great'' aunt of [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] in the [[1890s]], although her precise date of birth is not mentioned.
*A picture by concept artist Peter Mckinstry shows [[:File:BathildaWithAcademics.png|a photograph of Bathilda Bagshot and other academics sitting in a classroom at Hogwarts Castle]]. This seems to be a reference to the famous [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Solvay_conference_1927.jpg picture of the 1927 Solvay Conference on Quantum Mechanics], as both the clothes and the overall alignment of individuals are similar. In the picture, Bathilda seems to take the place of [[Wikipedia:Marie Curie|Marie Curie]]: in both pictures they are the only featured women, and they are both in a similar position and in a similar pose.
*In a ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'' prop for [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|the first part of the film adaptation]] of {{DH}}, Bathilda Bagshot's name is poorly transcribed as "Batholith". The same book referred to [[Godric's Hollow]] as "Godlike's Hollow", [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] as "Canard" and [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] as "Hog warts".
*Her name may have been inspired by {{wplink|Walter Bagehot}}, who, in [[1867]], wrote the book that is considered the most important text on the British system of government.  His work ''{{wplink|The English Constitution}}'' had nearly the same status in British public schools as ''A History of Magic'' did at Hogwarts.
*Being the great-aunt of Gellert Grindelwald, Bathilda must have had at least one sister or brother who fathered Gellert's father or mother.
*Both she and her great-nephew were killed by [[Tom Riddle]], but not at the same time.
*This makes them the second pair of relatives killed by Tom Riddle. The first is composed of [[James and Lily Potter|Lily and James Potter]], but they were killed at the same time.
