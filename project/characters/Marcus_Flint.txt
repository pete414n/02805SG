'''Marcus Flint''' (b. [[1975]]/[[1976]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1987]] to [[1994]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]] house. He was a [[Chaser]] on the Slytherin [[Quidditch]] [[Slytherin Quidditch team|team]], as well as its Captain from at least [[1991]] to [[1994]]. 

==Biography==

===Early life===
Marcus was born in September [[1975]] to August [[1976]] in [[Great Britain]]. He was a descendant of the [[pure-blood]] [[Flint family]] and perhaps related in some way to former [[Minister for Magic]], [[Josephina Flint]] and [[Ursula Flint|Ursula Black]] (née Flint). It is unknown if Marcus himself was a pure-blood.

===Hogwarts years (1987-1994)===
====Early years====
[[File:Slytherin team.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Marcus and other Slytherins playing a game of Quidditch|alt=]]
Flint began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1987]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. He lived in a dormitory in the [[Slytherin Dungeon]], and his [[Head of House]] was the [[Potions Master]], [[Professor]] [[Severus Snape]].

At some point, he joined the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] as a [[Chaser]] and became its [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|captain]] by his [[fifth year]]. Flint was known for being very rough and often brutal in his Quidditch-playing; for example, his handshakes with [[Gryffindor]] Captain and rival [[Oliver Wood]] often turned into attempts to break one another's fingers. He was also not above committing fouls, blocking [[Harry Potter]] in a [[1991]] Quidditch match.

====Sixth year====

[[File:Slytherin Quidditch team.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Marcus and the Slytherin Quidditch team antagonising Gryffindor]]
In [[1992]], Flint was pleased when his team received [[Nimbus 2001|new broomsticks]], courtesy of [[Lucius Malfoy]], when his son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] became the team's new [[Seeker]]. They bragged to the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] about this and mocked their rivals' older brooms. This prompted [[Hermione Granger]] to insult Draco, remarking that "''at least no one on the Gryffindor team had to ''buy'' their way in''". Draco retaliated by calling Hermione a "''filthy little [[Mudblood]]''" to the outrage of the Gryffindors. Flint had to stand in front of Draco to prevent [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] from attacking and injuring his Seeker. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] then attempted to [[Slug-Vomiting Charm|curse]] Draco, but it backfired, and the entire Slytherin team laughed uproariously as Ron vomited [[slug]]s. 

Flint was angered by Draco's stupidity during a match against Gryffindor. He reprimanded him after the game because Draco failed to notice the [[Golden Snitch]] next to him, causing Slytherin to lose the match. This was witnessed by George Weasley.

====Seventh year====
{{Quote|Sorry! Sorry, didn't see her!|Flint audaciously defending his foul play|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Harry Holding Quidditch Cup in a Crowd.png|250x250px|thumb|left|Gryffindor defeats Slytherin and wins the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]]]] 
During Flint's final year, he participated in a scheme to scare Harry Potter with Draco, [[Vincent Crabbe]], and [[Gregory Goyle]]. The four Slytherins dressed up as [[Dementor]]s, which were guarding Hogwarts that year due to [[Sirius Black]]'s escape from [[Azkaban]]. Following their cruel prank, [[Professor]] [[Minerva McGonagall]] took fifty [[House points]] from [[Slytherin]] and sentenced all four of them to detention as punishment. 

During the Quidditch final between Gryffindor and Slytherin [[1993–1994 school year|that year]], Flint played unscrupulously yet again against the rival team, smashing into [[Angelina Johnson]] with his broom, which resulted in [[Fred Weasley]] throwing his [[Beater's bat]] at his head, smashing his nose against his broom handle and causing it to bleed. Flint later managed during the game to score a goal against Gryffindor, but Harry caught the [[Golden Snitch]], allowing Gryffindor to win the game and to gain the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] at last.

===Later Life===
It is unknown what happened to Flint after he graduated Hogwarts and what his status was during the [[Second Wizarding War]].

During the 2010s, Flint's younger self appeared as a [[Foundable]] during the [[Calamity]], clad in his Slytherin Quidditch uniform and entrapped by a magical [[fire]] [[Confoundable]]. Volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] were able to free him by casting the [[Water-Making Spell]], allowing Flint to return to his original time.

==Physical appearance==
[[File:Flint.png|214x214px|thumb|Flint's unappealing physical appearance]]
{{Quote|[[Harry Potter|Harry]] thought Flint looked as if he had some [[troll]] [[blood]] in him.|Harry's description of Marcus Flint|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Marcus was described as being tall and relatively muscular. [[Harry Potter]] also mentioned that he looked like he might have [[troll]] [[blood]] in him. However, this may simply have been an insult toward Flint's appearance.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|'Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you', [[Rolanda Hooch|she]] said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year.|Rolanda Hooch's observation of Flint's cheating|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

Flint did not follow good sportsmanship when playing [[Quidditch]], despite his position as [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of his [[Slytherin Quidditch team|team]]. He allowed [[Draco Malfoy]] to join the team when bribed with the new [[Nimbus 2001]] [[broomstick]]s. Flint also resorted frequently to foul play, such as blocking [[Harry Potter]] in [[1991]] and trying to scare him by disguising as a [[Dementor]] in [[1993]]. 

He seemed to find the misfortunes of others amusing as he laughed when Ron's [[Slug-vomiting Charm]] backfired on himself. When Draco failed to notice the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] floating above his head, leading the team to lose, Flint yelled at the new [[Seeker]] rather harshly for his foolishness. 

It was unknown how he viewed the importance of [[blood status]], though he seemed to approve of when Draco called [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] a [[mudblood]] and even defended him from harm afterwards, implying he may have held some prejudice towards [[Muggle-born]]s or that he was a [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]], similar to many other Slytherin students.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Marcus played as a [[Chaser]] on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]. He was the [[Captain]] from at least his fifth year to his seventh year, demonstrating he was an accomplished and skilled [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, despite his frequent cheating and foul play on the Quidditch pitch.

==Etymology==
*The name Marcus is derived from Mars, the god of war in Roman mythology. This may allude to Flint's aggression. It is interestingly the opposite of [[Oliver Wood]]'s name, which means "olive tree", ultimately symbolising Wood's peaceful nature. 
*A flint is a stone used for lighting a [[fire]]. Once again, this alludes to his relationship with Oliver Wood; flint is kindling fire, and wood burns when in contact with fire.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Marcus.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus as a LEGO minifigure (first edition)]]
[[File:MarcusFlintLEGOM.jpg|thumb|Marcus Flint as a LEGO mini-figure (second edition)]]
*Flint was originally stated to be a [[Sixth year|sixth-year]] in {{PS}}, yet he was still at the school in {{POA}} (two years after his debut). [[J. K. Rowling]] explained this by saying that he had to repeat his last year because he failed his exams the first time round. This explanation did not deter some fans from noticing other consistency errors with Flint's schooling years. However, in later editions of {{PS}}, Flint is stated to be a [[fifth year]], presumably to clear confusion and the need for a repeated year.
*Flint was portrayed by [[Jamie Yeates]] in [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|the first]] film while the role was incorrectly credited to [[Will Theakston]], who played [[Terence Higgs]]. Yeates reprised the role and was credited correctly in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|second]] film. He wore false teeth in both films.
*Flint once borrowed {{QTA|R}} from the [[Hogwarts Library]] and was due to return the book on [[22 June]].
*If [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] attended Hogwarts, he would have been in the same year as Marcus Flint.{{cn}}
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Marcus Flint is the [[Slytherin Quidditch team|Slytherin team]]'s [[Seeker]].
*He was referred to as "Captain Flint" because he was captain of the Slytherin Quidditch Team. This may be an allusion to the [[wikipedia:Captain Flint|similarly-named captain]] of the pirate ship ''Walrus'' from [[wikipedia:Robert Louis Stevenson|Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[wikipedia:Treasure Island|Treasure Island]]''.
