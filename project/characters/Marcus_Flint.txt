'''Marcus Flint''' (b. [[1975]]/[[1976]])<ref name="DOB" /> was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1987]] to [[1994]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]] house. He was a [[Chaser]] on the Slytherin [[Quidditch]] [[Slytherin Quidditch team|team]], as well as its Captain from at least [[1991]] to [[1994]]. 

==Biography==

===Early life===
Marcus was born in September [[1975]] to August [[1976]]<ref name="DOB" /> in [[Great Britain]]. He was a descendant of the [[pure-blood]] [[Flint family]] and perhaps related in some way to former [[Minister for Magic]], [[Josephina Flint]] and [[Ursula Flint|Ursula Black]] (née Flint). It is unknown if Marcus himself was a pure-blood.

===Hogwarts years (1987-1994)===
====Early years====
[[File:Slytherin team.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Marcus and other Slytherins playing a game of Quidditch|alt=]]
Flint began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1987]]<ref name="DOB" /> and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. He lived in a dormitory in the [[Slytherin Dungeon]], and his [[Head of House]] was the [[Potions Master]], [[Professor]] [[Severus Snape]].

At some point, he joined the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] as a [[Chaser]] and became its [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|captain]] by his [[fifth year]]. Flint was known for being very rough and often brutal in his Quidditch-playing; for example, his handshakes with [[Gryffindor]] Captain and rival [[Oliver Wood]] often turned into attempts to break one another's fingers. He was also not above committing fouls, blocking [[Harry Potter]] in a [[1991]] Quidditch match.<ref name="PS11">{{PS|B|11}}</ref>

====Sixth year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Oliver Wood|I don't believe it! Where you think you're going, Flint?|Flint|Quidditch practice! |I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.|Marcus and Oliver Wood argue over the Hogwarts' Quidditch pitch|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets }}
[[File:Slytherin Quidditch team.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Marcus and the Slytherin Quidditch team antagonising Gryffindor]]
In [[1992]], Flint was pleased when his team received [[Nimbus 2001|new broomsticks]], courtesy of [[Lucius Malfoy]], when his son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] became the team's new [[Seeker]]. They bragged to the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] about this and mocked their rivals' older brooms. This prompted [[Hermione Granger]] to insult Draco, remarking that "''at least no one on the Gryffindor team had to ''buy'' their way in''". Draco retaliated by calling Hermione a "''filthy little [[Mudblood]]''" to the outrage of the Gryffindors. Flint had to stand in front of Draco to prevent [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] from attacking and injuring his Seeker. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] then attempted to [[Slug-Vomiting Charm|curse]] Draco, but it backfired, and the entire Slytherin team laughed uproariously as Ron vomited [[slug]]s.<ref name="CS7">{{COS|B|7}}</ref> 

Flint was angered by Draco's stupidity during a match against Gryffindor. He reprimanded him after the game because Draco failed to notice the [[Golden Snitch]] next to him, causing Slytherin to lose the match. This was witnessed by George Weasley.<ref name="COS10">{{COS|B|10}}</ref>

====Seventh year====
{{Quote|Sorry! Sorry, didn't see her!|Flint audaciously defending his foul play|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Harry Holding Quidditch Cup in a Crowd.png|250x250px|thumb|left|Gryffindor defeats Slytherin and wins the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]]]] 
During Flint's final year, he participated in a scheme to scare Harry Potter with Draco, [[Vincent Crabbe]], and [[Gregory Goyle]]. The four Slytherins dressed up as [[Dementor]]s, which were guarding Hogwarts that year due to [[Sirius Black]]'s escape from [[Azkaban]].<ref name="POA13">{{POA|B|13}}</ref> Following their cruel prank, [[Professor]] [[Minerva McGonagall]] took fifty [[House points]] from [[Slytherin]] and sentenced all four of them to detention as punishment. 

During the Quidditch final between Gryffindor and Slytherin [[1993–1994 school year|that year]], Flint played unscrupulously yet again against the rival team, smashing into [[Angelina Johnson]] with his broom, which resulted in [[Fred Weasley]] throwing his [[Beater's bat]] at his head, smashing his nose against his broom handle and causing it to bleed. Flint later managed during the game to score a goal against Gryffindor, but Harry caught the [[Golden Snitch]], allowing Gryffindor to win the game and to gain the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] at last.<ref name="POA15">{{POA|B|15}}</ref>

===Later life===
It is unknown what happened to Flint after he graduated Hogwarts and what his status was during the [[Second Wizarding War]].

During the 2010s, Flint's younger self appeared as a [[Foundable]] during the [[Calamity]], clad in his Slytherin Quidditch uniform and entrapped by a magical [[fire]] [[Confoundable]]. Volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] were able to free him by casting the [[Water-Making Spell]], allowing Flint to return to his original time.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
[[File:Flint.png|214x214px|thumb|Flint's unappealing physical appearance]]
{{Quote|[[Harry Potter|Harry]] thought Flint looked as if he had some [[troll]] [[blood]] in him.|Harry's description of Marcus Flint|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Marcus was described as being tall and relatively muscular. [[Harry Potter]] also mentioned that he looked like he might have [[troll]] [[blood]] in him.<ref name="PS11"/> However, this may simply have been an insult toward Flint's appearance.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|'Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you', [[Rolanda Hooch|she]] said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year.|Rolanda Hooch's observation of Flint's cheating|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

Flint did not follow good sportsmanship when playing [[Quidditch]], despite his position as [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of his [[Slytherin Quidditch team|team]]. He allowed [[Draco Malfoy]] to join the team when bribed with the new [[Nimbus 2001]] [[broomstick]]s.<ref name="CS7"/> Flint also resorted frequently to foul play, such as blocking [[Harry Potter]] in [[1991]]<ref name="PS11"/> and trying to scare him by disguising as a [[Dementor]] in [[1993]].<ref name="POA13"/> 

He seemed to find the misfortunes of others amusing as he laughed when Ron's [[Slug-vomiting Charm]] backfired on himself.<ref name="CS7" /> When Draco failed to notice the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] floating above his head, leading the team to lose, Flint yelled at the new [[Seeker]] rather harshly for his foolishness.<ref name="COS10" /> 

It was unknown how he viewed the importance of [[blood status]], though he seemed to approve of when Draco called [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] a [[mudblood]] and even defended him from harm afterwards, implying he may have held some prejudice towards [[Muggle-born]]s or that he was a [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]], similar to many other Slytherin students.<ref name="CS7" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Marcus played as a [[Chaser]] on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]. He was the [[Captain]] from at least his fifth year to his seventh year, demonstrating he was an accomplished and skilled [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, despite his frequent cheating and foul play on the Quidditch pitch.<ref name="PS11"/><ref name="POA15"/>

==Etymology==
*The name Marcus is derived from Mars, the god of war in Roman mythology. This may allude to Flint's aggression. It is interestingly the opposite of [[Oliver Wood]]'s name, which means "olive tree", ultimately symbolising Wood's peaceful nature. 
*A flint is a stone used for lighting a [[fire]]. Once again, this alludes to his relationship with Oliver Wood; flint is kindling fire, and wood burns when in contact with fire.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Marcus.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus as a LEGO minifigure (first edition)]]
[[File:MarcusFlintLEGOM.jpg|thumb|Marcus Flint as a LEGO mini-figure (second edition)]]
*Flint was originally stated to be a [[Sixth year|sixth-year]] in {{PS}}, yet he was still at the school in {{POA}} (two years after his debut). [[J. K. Rowling]] explained this by saying that he had to repeat his last year because he failed his exams the first time round.<ref name="accio">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0200-scholastic-chat.htm Online chat transcript, Scholastic.com, 3 February 2000]</ref><ref name="Official Site">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221309/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=16 F.A.Q.] from {{JKRS}} (via the [https://web.archive.org/ Internet Archive])</ref> This explanation did not deter some fans from noticing other consistency errors with Flint's schooling years. However, in later editions of {{PS}}, Flint is stated to be a [[fifth year]], presumably to clear confusion and the need for a repeated year.
*Flint was portrayed by [[Jamie Yeates]] in [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|the first]] film while the role was incorrectly credited to [[Will Theakston]], who played [[Terence Higgs]]. Yeates reprised the role and was credited correctly in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|second]] film. He wore false teeth in both films.
*Flint once borrowed {{QTA|R}} from the [[Hogwarts Library]] and was due to return the book on [[22 June]].
*If [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] attended Hogwarts, he would have been in the same year as Marcus Flint.{{cn}}
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Marcus Flint is the [[Slytherin Quidditch team|Slytherin team]]'s [[Seeker]].
*He was referred to as "Captain Flint" because he was captain of the Slytherin Quidditch Team. This may be an allusion to the [[wikipedia:Captain Flint|similarly-named captain]] of the pirate ship ''Walrus'' from [[wikipedia:Robert Louis Stevenson|Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[wikipedia:Treasure Island|Treasure Island]]''.
