This '''unidentified goblin''' worked in the capacity of Head [[Goblin]] of [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in the early [[1990s]].

==Biography==
On [[31 July]], [[1991]], this goblin summoned [[Griphook]] to aid [[Harry Potter]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in performing their withdrawals in Gringotts.

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unknown if he was still employed at Gringotts, because he was not seen among the other Goblins when Harry and his friends broke into the bank on [[1 May]], [[1998]].
*The Head Goblin was portrayed by [[Warwick Davis]], who also portrayed [[Professor]] [[Filius Flitwick]]. Davis went on to play [[Griphook]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|film adaptation]] of {{DH}}.
*This goblin's role in the story is replaced by [[Griphook]] in most [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|video game adaptations]].
*[[Brady Dalton Richards]], the actor portraying [[Scorpius Malfoy]] in {{CC|NY}}, also portrayed this particular goblin, voicing him when the [[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child cast lists|cast]] of {{CC}} read aloud {{PS|B|5}} together, organised by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] for the [[2021]] [[Harry Potter Book Night]].
