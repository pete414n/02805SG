{{Quote|Andromeda was my favourite cousin. No, Andromeda's not on here either, look. Andromeda's sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so —|Sirius Black on Andromeda's refusal to live up to her families' expectations|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Andromeda "Dromeda" Tonks''' (née '''Black''') (b. between [[1951]] and [[1955]]),<ref name="birth"/> was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the middle daughter of [[Cygnus Black III|Cygnus]] and [[Druella Black]] {{c|née Rosier}}, as well as the sister of [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]]. She attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1960s]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].

After graduating from Hogwarts, she married a [[Muggle-born]], [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]], and was disowned by her prejudiced [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] family. From that point onward she and her relatives had no further contact. In [[1973]] she became the mother of [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Her daughter later became an [[Auror]] in [[1994]] under the watchful eyes of [[Alastor Moody]].

During the [[Second Wizarding War]], Andromeda and her husband were allies of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], as their daughter was a member. Nymphadora married [[Remus Lupin]] in [[1997]] and had a son, [[Edward Lupin|Edward Remus Lupin]]. In [[1998]] during the height of the war Andromeda's husband was murdered by [[Snatchers]]. Remus was murdered during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and Nymphadora was also murdered by Andromeda's older sister, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].

After the [[Second Wizarding War]], Andromeda raised her grandson with the help of his godfather [[Harry Potter]]. This meant that Teddy also spent time with the [[Potter family|Potter]] and [[Weasley family|Weasley]] families.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Narcissa, Andromeda, and Bellatrix.jpeg|249x249px|thumb|left|A young Andromeda (right) with her older sister [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and her younger sister [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]]]]

Andromeda was born in the early [[1950s]]. She was the second daughter of [[Cygnus Black III|Cygnus]] and [[Druella Black]] (née [[Rosier family|Rosier]]), and younger sister of Bellatrix Lestrange and older sister of [[Narcissa Malfoy]]. [[Walburga Black|Walburga]] and [[Orion Black]] were her aunt and uncle on her father's side, and [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and [[Regulus Black]] her cousins. [[Evan Rosier]] may be a relative on her mother's side. [[Alphard Black]] was also Andromeda's uncle.<ref>[[House of Black|Black family tree]]</ref>

She was Sirius Black's favourite cousin, but he never met her married family before his imprisonment in [[Azkaban]] in [[1981]].<ref name="OTP">{{OOTP}}</ref>

===Hogwarts years===
{{Quote|She is no niece of ours, my Lord. We — Narcissa and I — have never set eyes on our sister since she married the [[Edward Tonks|Mudblood]]. This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.|The recent marriage of Nymphadora Tonks|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

Andromeda attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from the mid-1960s to the early [[1970s]] and was [[Sorting Hat|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]].<ref name="slytherin" /> She may have been very skilled in [[Charms (class)|Charms]] class, given her proficiency with casting various household charms. It is also possible that she was talented in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. In her adult life she managed to resist torture without revealing any vital information or losing her sanity.

At some point during or after her education at Hogwarts, Andromeda met and subsequently fell in love with [[Muggle-born]] wizard [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]], despite her family's steadfast belief in the importance of [[Blood status|blood purity]].

===Life after Hogwarts===
{{Quote|My mum's got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly —she even gets the socks to fold themselves — but I've never mastered how she does it — it's a kind of flick —|Nymphadora speaking about Andromeda's cleanliness and neatness|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[File:Andromeda and Ted.jpg|235x235px|thumb|Andromeda with her husband [[Ted Tonks]]|alt=|left]]

Andromeda married Ted and was subsequently disowned and burned off the family tapestry in [[12 Grimmauld Place]] by her aunt, parents and sisters. Statements by her sisters indicate that both of them cut off contact with Andromeda because they considered her a [[blood traitor]] for her marriage.<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

In [[1973]], around the age of twenty, Andromeda and Ted had one child, [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Andromeda had selected the first name, which her daughter strongly disliked, preferring to be known simply as "Tonks" by her friends. Ted, Remus Lupin, and Andromeda called her Dora for short.

Andromeda, throughout her family life with Ted and Nymphadora, had a constant talent for cleanliness that her husband and daughter did not share.<ref name="OTP" />
[[File:Andromeda and Bellatrix.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|Andromeda's burn mark on the [[Black Family Tapestry]]]]
Her daughter, Nymphadora, began her first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1984]] and was sorted into [[Hufflepuff]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] at the Sorting ceremony. Nymphadora graduated from Hogwarts in [[1991]] and went on to train and later work as an [[Auror]] for the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. Nymphadora worked as an Auror between the wars and during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Andromeda frequently worried about her daughter's safety.

====Second Wizarding War {{c|1995-1998}}====
{{Dialogue a-b|Andromeda|What happened to our daughter? Hagrid said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?|Harry Potter|I don't know. We don't know what happened to anyone else.|Andromeda concerned for her daughter's safety|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

Although Andromeda and Ted did not appear to be official members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], they allowed their [[Tonks house|home]] to be one of the Order's safe-houses and were supportive of the organisation to which their daughter belonged. Nymphadora married [[Remus Lupin]] in the summer of [[1997]]; he suspected that her parents did not approve because he was a [[werewolf]], though it is unknown if this was true; given the fact that Andromeda was not a pure-blood supremacist.

After the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], they were instrumental in Harry Potter's moving from [[Privet Drive]] to [[The Burrow]]: [[Harry Potter]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] took temporary refuge in Tonks' home, where Andromeda took care of Hagrid's injuries. She seemed somewhat offended when Harry first reacted to her as if she were her sister Bellatrix because of their resemblance. She and Ted were both very worried about their daughter when they learned that the Order was ambushed by [[Death Eaters]] when transporting Harry, though Ted tried to reassure his wife by pointing out that their daughter had been through worse in the course of her work as an [[Auror]].

When the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] fell under [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s control in August of 1997, the magical protections around the Order safe-houses were broken. Andromeda and Ted were interrogated and [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] by Death Eaters for information pertaining to Harry Potter and the Order. Their son-in-law reported that they were "''shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay''".<ref name="DH" /> Soon after this, their daughter discovered that she was pregnant and came to stay with Andromeda and Ted, as her husband temporarily left her out of fear that he would pass on lycanthropy to their child.

The Ministry soon began persecuting [[Muggle-born]]s by forming the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]], which charged Muggle-borns with having stolen their magic and their wands from "real" witches and wizards. Ted refused to register on principle and was forced to go on the run; Andromeda, as a [[pure-blood]], was safe and stayed with her pregnant daughter. Some time before the birth of her grandson [[Edward Lupin|Teddy]], Andromeda was left a widow, as her husband was murdered by [[Snatchers]].

Andromeda's daughter and son-in-law were killed in action during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], Andromeda's sister, and [[Antonin Dolohov]], respectively. Bellatrix was later killed herself by [[Molly Weasley]].

===Later life {{c|Post 1998}}===
Andromeda was left with custody of her grandson, though Teddy also spent a lot of time with his godfather, [[Harry Potter]], and the [[Weasley family]].<ref name="DH" />

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|As she moved forward into the room, Mrs Tonks's resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder.|Andromeda's physical similarity to her sister [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

Andromeda was described to have an uncanny physical resemblance to her older sister, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], to the extent where Harry almost attacked her during their first meeting. 

Hence, she most likely had the patrician beauty and aristocratic bearing that were the typical characteristics of the [[House of Black]], the only differences being that, while Bellatrix was dark-haired and had heavily-lidded, malicious-looking eyes, Andromeda had light brown hair, and her eyes were wider and kinder.<ref name="hair" />

==Personality and traits==
It is safe to assume, given her marriage to a [[Muggle-born]], that Andromeda was very different from both of her sisters: while her sisters married into "''respectable''" pure-blood families, she married for [[love]] despite her family's opposition, leading to her family's hatred of her.

She was clearly a good mother, as seen by her showing her concern about her daughter's whereabouts after the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and taking care of her during her pregnancy. She was also a good grandmother, as she raised her daughter's son after her death.

Apart from her husband and daughter, her cousin Sirius Black considered her to be his only true family. This demonstrated that Andromeda always treated Sirius with respect and kindness. In addition to being a good wife, mother, and grandmother, she was a good friend to most people she knew. She was also strong-willed, as when she was tortured she did not reveal anything that could harm [[Harry Potter]] or any of her friends. 

Like [[Molly Weasley]], Andromeda was a woman dedicated to her family and friends. Thus, in many ways, Andromeda's personality contradicted the "evil Slytherin" stereotype held by many students of the other Houses. Instead, she appeared to embody the Slytherin principle of fraternity. This was seen by her standing by her friends, family, and allies.

==Magical abilities and skills==

*[[Healing magic|'''Healing magic''']]: After the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], Harry and Hagrid took refuge in her house, where she successfully healed Hagrid's injuries. Given Hagrid's half-giant nature and concomitant natural magical resistance, this does imply she was a talented Healer.<ref name="DH" />
*'''[[Household magic]]''': Andromeda had a talent for cleanliness and household spells, a talent that her husband and her daughter did not share. According to [[Nymphadora Tonks]], Andromeda was skilled with [[Pack Charm]], getting stuff to fit itself in neatly and even getting socks to fold themselves.<ref name="OOTP3">{{OOTP|B|3}}</ref>

==Relationships==

===Family===

====Black Family====
[[File:Narcissa Malfoy promo.jpg|233x233px|thumb|[[Narcissa Malfoy]], her younger sister|alt=|left]]

Andromeda's relationship with her parents was likely a bad one. Because she married a [[Muggle-born]] against her family's ideals of blood purity she was disowned and not considered a Black after that. It is safe to assume that her parents did not consider her as their daughter anymore and, like Bellatrix and Narcissa, cut off all contact with her. It is also possible that Andromeda's parents never met their granddaughter.

It is unknown what kind of relationship Andromeda had with her older sister, Bellatrix Lestrange, and younger sister, Narcissa Malfoy, when they were younger. However, both her sisters believed in [[pure-blood]] supremacy, whereas Andromeda obviously did not, given her marriage.

[[File:Bellatrix Lestrange promo.jpg|243x243px|thumb|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]], her older sister and murderer of her daughter|alt=]]

After she married the Muggle-born Ted, Andromeda was disowned and both her sisters cut off all contact with her.<ref name="DH" /> Andromeda's relationship with Bellatrix was likely particularly hateful, given that Bellatrix murdered Andromeda's own daughter (though, given the circumstances, she likely didn't learn of the latter until after the battle and her eldest sister's death). It can be assumed that Bellatrix would not have hesitated to kill Andromeda herself if she ever encountered her again. Andromeda also seemed to be offended when [[Harry Potter]], upon first seeing her, reacted as if she were her older sister.<ref name="DH" /> 

It can also be presumed that Andromeda showed no remorse for her older sister's death at the hands of [[Molly Weasley]]. This lack of remorse can be attributed to Bellatrix's cruelty towards her and her murder of her child and Sirius. Andromeda's relationship with Narcissa, however, is unknown, though it was most likely similar to that of her relationship to Bellatrix and thus extremely hateful. It is doubtful the two ever met again even following Voldemort's defeat as Narcissa still strongly valued pure-blood supremacy.

Andromeda's younger cousin Sirius Black told Harry Potter in [[1995]] that Andromeda was his favourite cousin.<ref name="OTP" /> Like her, Sirius was considered a "[[blood traitor]]" by their family, and was disowned for his beliefs. Thus, the two were likely close in their younger years. Sirius considered Andromeda and Tonks his only and true family.

====Ted Tonks====
Andromeda married [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]] for love in spite of her family's hatred of [[Muggle-born]]s (and usual habit of forced marriages) which led to her being disowned<ref name="OTP" /> and shunned by her own sisters. Ted comforted his wife when they were unsure what happened to their daughter after the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], reassuring her that, as an [[Auror]], Tonks had been through worse.<ref name="DH" />

====Nymphadora Tonks====
{{Dialogue a-b|Remus Lupin|Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname only.|Nymphadora Tonks|So would you if your fool of a mother had called you Nymphadora.|Nymphadora's dislike of her own name|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[File:Nymphadora Tonks DH promo headshot .jpg|233x233px|thumb|[[Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Lupin]], her late daughter|alt=|left]]

Nymphadora and her mother were close, though Tonks disliked the given name Andromeda gave her,<ref name="OTP" /> to the point of Nymphadora describing her mother as foolish for giving her the name. It's unknown how Andromeda took the news that her daughter and [[Remus Lupin]] were in [[love]] and that they planned to marry. It's also unknown how she initially reacted to Nymphadora's pregnancy. Andromeda was frantic with worry over her daughter's participation in the [[Second Wizarding War]] and opted to stay with her during her pregnancy, while Ted went on the run from the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. 

When Tonks went to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], she left her infant son in the care of his grandmother. It's unknown how she took the news of her daughter's death at the hands of her older sister, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]]. One can assume that the loss of her only child was devastating.

After the final battle of the Second Wizarding War, Andromeda would raise the boy after his parents' deaths with the help of Teddy´s godfather [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="DH" />

===Harry Potter===
{{Quote|Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid. ''You!'' he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty.|Harry meets Andromeda for the first time|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Harry Potter.jpg|233x233px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], godfather of her grandson|alt=]]

The first time Harry met Andromeda, he thought that she looked a lot like her sister [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] but with kinder eyes and lighter hair.<ref name="hair" /> Her resemblance to Bellatrix was such that Harry attempted to attack her, but upon realising his mistake, he felt bad and apologised as her physical comparison to her sister seemed offensive to her.

After [[Duel in the Great Hall|Voldemort's downfall]], Harry helped Andromeda raise her grandson and his godson, [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]]. Harry liked and respected Andromeda for her ideals and because she was Tonks' mother. It is possible that after the war they would see each other regularly and probable in such a scenario that they would develop a bond because of Teddy, Remus, and Tonks's memory. It is also highly likely that Andromeda herself was welcomed at Harry and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]'s house as a dinner guest, along with her grandson.

===Order of the Phoenix===
Andromeda was not an official member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], but nevertheless, she supported the Order's ideals (given her marriage to a [[Edward Tonks|Muggle-born]]). As her daughter and son-in-law were members, she would allow the Order use of her house as a safe house. It is likely that she has a good relation with all of the members, and because she was at Hogwarts at the same time as [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur and]] [[Molly Weasley]], a friendship might have started there. 

The degree and nature of her involvement during the [[First Wizarding War]] is unknown, but it is reasonable to assume that she helped them in some way. Andromeda proved her loyalty in 1998 when she was tortured by Death Eater in her home and did not reveal anything of importance regarding Harry or the Order, despite the fact that she was under torture.

==Etymology==
Many members of the [[House of Black]] — such as [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], and [[Cygnus Black (disambiguation)|Cygnus]] — appear to be named after stars or constellations, and the name Andromeda follows this pattern. It is a northern [[Wikipedia:Andromeda (constellation)|constellation]] that contains the Andromeda Galaxy and was named after the character from Greek mythology: a [[Wikipedia:Andromeda (mythology)|princess]] who was chained to a rock to be sacrificed to a sea monster, as divine punishment for her mother's (Cassiopeia) boasting, but was saved by the hero Perseus, whom she then married. This may allude to Andromeda Tonks' estrangement from her aristocratic, but cruel extended family.

==Behind the scenes==

*Out of the three Black sisters, Andromeda was the only sister that has not appeared in any of the films.
*Andromeda is also the only one of the five Black cousins who has not appeared in the films, as her two sisters appeared in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' through to the ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]'', Bellatrix also appearing in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix.]] ''[[Sirius Black]] appeared in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' through ''Order of the Phoenix'' and in ''Deathly Hallows: Part 2,'' and a younger [[Regulus Black]] appeared in one of [[Horace Slughorn]]'s photographs in the ''Half-Blood Prince''.
*Due to the similarities in appearance shared by Andromeda and her sister, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], fans of the Harry Potter series set up an online petition to have [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who plays Bellatrix, play Andromeda in {{DH|F1}}.<ref>http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/HelenaBCforAndromedaTonks/</ref> However, as Harry and Hagrid escape to [[the Burrow]] rather than the Tonks house, Andromeda and Ted were both cut from the film.
*There seems to be a common recurrence in the Black Family tree where the middle of three children get disowned, [[Cedrella Black]] for marrying blood-traitor [[Septimus Weasley]], [[Alphard Black]] for giving his disowned nephew "a decent bit of gold" and Andromeda herself for marrying a Muggle-born.
