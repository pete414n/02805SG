'''Anthony Goldstein''' (b. c. [[1980]]) was a [[half-blood]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. He was Sorted into [[Ravenclaw]] house. In his fifth year he was selected as one of his House's [[Prefect]]s. He also joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and lead by [[Harry Potter]]. 

He later fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]]. Anthony survived the final battle of the [[Second Wizarding War]] and graduated from school. He was most likely present for Harry Potter's final defeat of [[Lord Voldemort]].



Anthony was born into the [[Goldstein family]]. He had at least one magical parent



In [[1991]], Anthony began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was in the same class as the famous Harry Potter. He was sorted into [[Ravenclaw]] house, which values wit and creativity. 

He befriended dorm-mates [[Terry Boot]] and [[Michael Corner]], and was also on speaking terms with [[Ernest Macmillan]].

Fifth year


In his fifth year, Anthony was made one of [[Ravenclaw]]'s new [[prefect]]s, alongside [[Padma Patil]]. He signed the [[Dumbledore's Army]] parchment and joined the group. 


Hermione, Harry Potter, and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] met Anthony outside of the hospital wing and told him of the location of the D.A. meetings — in the [[Room of Requirement]] — and how to access it. He and his friends [[Terry Boot]], [[Michael Corner]], and [[Ernie Macmillan]] participated in many of the meetings held. It can be assumed that Anthony enjoyed the meetings, as he never complained. 


In order to practise the [[Disarming Charm]], he was paired with [[Zacharias Smith]] in one sof the meetings. However, whenever Zacharias opened his mouth to cast the spell and disarm Anthony, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] would slyly disarm him.  He learned how to cast new [[spell]]s such as a the [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] charm, but he only ever succeeded in casting a non-corporeal Patronus.

Anthony took his practical [[Charms (class)|Charms]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] at the same time as [[Gregory Goyle]], Hermione and [[Daphne Greengrass]]. He did well enough in his exams to stay on for [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]].

On the [[Hogwarts Express]] after the school year's conclusion, Anthony sat in a compartment with Terry, Michael, [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], and [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]]. Gregory Goyle, [[Vincent Crabbe]], and [[Draco Malfoy]] attempted to attack Harry on the train outside of their compartment, but the seven of them used a variety of jinxes and hexes that Harry had taught them, after which the Slytherins resembled three gigantic slugs.

Seventh year

]]
In 1998, Hogwarts was under the control of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his followers, students were brutally punished and taught different subjects. For example, how to use dark magic instead of defending against it. Sensing the need for rebellion yet again, Anthony joined the reconstituted [[Dumbledore's Army]]. He and fellow D.A. members stood up against [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] control of Hogwarts. 

Anthony may have participated in spray painting the walls or helping fellow students who were also suffering. He would hide in the [[Room of Requirement]], as the room had become a sort of sanctuary for D.A. members.  

Battle of Hogwarts

He bravely fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. It can be assumed that he survived the final battle, since he was not mentioned among the [[Fallen Fifty]]. He most likely witnessed Harry Potter's final defat of Lord Voldemort, thus ending the [[Second Wizarding War]].

Later life
After the battle, he most likely kept his [[Dumbledore's Army coin|D.A. coin]] as a badge of honour, as did other D.A. members. It can be assumed that he attended the [[2014]] reunion of Dumbledore's Army.


Anthony was a very friendly and good-natured individual. He was willing to disobey and risk being punished by [[Dolores Umbridge]], in opposition to her tyranny over [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. He was a devoted member of [[Dumbledore's Army]]. 

He was also very courageous and determined. He bravely fought against the [[Death Eaters]] in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], along with most of his friends and fellow students to defend his school.


*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': As a committed and loyal member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], Anthony would have learnt how to cast multiple highly practical defensive and offensive [[spell]]s, under the masterful teaching of [[Harry Potter]].
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Anthony was shown to be a skilled duellist with a high level talent in [[martial magic]]. Anthony and his friends at the end of the [[1995–1996 school year]] were able to successfully duel and defeat [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] after they tried to attack Harry Potter on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. They were able to successfully cast various unpleasant offensive spells on them, that they at the end of the duel resembled [[slug]]s. Furthermore, Anthony bravely fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]], along his D.A. comrades against the [[Death Eaters]] and presumably survived.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': He was capable of producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]. This was a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability and talent, given the immense difficulty of casting such an advanced and powerful protective charm. He presumably learnt how to cast this charm with the help of Dumbledore's Army's Patronus lesson.


Anthony was an [[Egypt]]ian ascetic monk considered to be the founder of Christian monasticism. Goldstein is a relatively common Jewish surname, which is a part of his Jewish heritage.


*Anthony was voiced by [[Tom Wheatley]] in . In the game, Anthony is portrayed as light-skinned with blond hair and blue eyes, being slightly shorter than [[Harry Potter]].
*From the student list seen in , it can be gleaned that Anthony was originally intended to be a [[Hufflepuff]].
*Anthony was the first character to be identified as [[Judaism|Jewish]], the information being revealed by [[J. K. Rowling]] on Twitter as an example of a Jewish person attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].
