{{Quote|Aha! What villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come to scorn at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!|Sir Cadogan's eccentric and forceful personality|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
'''Sir Cadogan''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and sworn [[Knights of the Round Table|Knight of the Round Table]], albeit not a very well known one, being only included in wizarding versions of the tales of [[Arthur|King Arthur]]. He is most famous for his defeat of the [[Wyvern of Wye]] at great personal risk.<ref name="PM" /> Sometime after his death, he was immortalised with a [[portrait]] at the end of the [[Divination corridor]] in [[Hogwarts Castle]], which displayed the same "insane bravery" as Cadogan did in life.<ref name="POA6">{{POA|B|6}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Cadogan was born in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]] to a wizarding family sometime in the [[Middle Ages]]. Like most British wizarding children, he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where his extreme bravery got him [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]]. It is possible that he was taught by [[Godric Gryffindor]] himself, given the time period Cadogan lived in. He also obtained a [[Cadogan's wand|wand]], which is believed by modern wizards to have been made of [[blackthorn]] with a [[troll whisker]] [[Wand core|core]].<ref name="PM" />

According to [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] belief, at some point in his life, he struck up a friendship with [[Merlin]], which would eventually secure him a prestigious position on the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. According to legend, he was married three times, each time [[Cadogan's ex-wives|the woman in question leaving him]], and fathered [[Cadogan's children|seventeen known children]].<ref name="PM" />

===Fighting the Wyvern of Wye===
Eventually, Sir Cadogan was appointed the task of defeating the [[Wyvern of Wye]], which was terrorising the [[West Country]]. Cadogan's first attempt to combat the creature ended with his original horse killed and his wand, sword, and visor destroyed. Cadogan barely managed to escape alive. Unlike most would in such a scenario, however, Cadogan refused to give up. At the very least wanting to accept a valiant death, he seized a [[Cadogan's pony|fat pony]] from a nearby meadow and charged towards the Wyvern, brandishing his broken wand. Though he was eaten, the broken wand pierced through the Wyvern's tongue and caused the fumes from its stomach to ignite, causing the beast to explode. Cadogan and the pony survived the encounter.<ref name="PM" />

===Post-mortem===
[[File:Cadogan3.png|250px|thumb|left|Sir Cadogan in his usual portrait with [[Cadogan's pony|his fat pony]]]]

The story of Sir Cadogan is included in wizarding versions of the tales of King Arthur, though [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] variations do not include him. Even among wizards, he is a lesser known figure, though the wizarding phrase "I'll take [[Cadogan's pony]]", meaning to salvage the best one can from a bad situation, was coined in his honour.<ref name="PM" />

A magical portrait of Sir Cadogan, painted during his life by a "[[Cadogan's portraitist|poor wizard]]" and depicting him with his oversized sword and fat pony, was hung on a seventh-floor landing near the [[Divination corridor]] at Hogwarts Castle.<ref name="POA6"/>

[[Harry Potter]] would have a number of encounters with this portrait during his years there.

====1988–1989====
During the [[1988–1989 school year]], [[Beatrice Haywood]] was stuck in an adjacent portrait. When her friends went to see her, Sir Cadogan would often communicate with them.<ref name="HM52">{{HM|5|2}}</ref> Sir Cadogan also gave [[Jacob's sibling]] a trial of knight and awarded them a [[suit of armour]] after they completed it.<ref name="HM5Trials">{{HM|5|The Trials of Sir Cadogan}}</ref>

When Jacob's sibling, on [[Peeves]]'s order, tried to cause chaos at the [[Grand Staircase]], he tried to credit [[Merlin]] the glory of defeating the [[Wyvern of Wye]] and this started an argument between Merlin and Sir Cadogan. In this argument, it was shown that the knight valued the glory of defeating the beast very much.<ref name="HM522">{{HM|5|22}}</ref>


====1989-1990====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|[[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]]|[[Fred and George Weasley]] delight in tormenting [[Merlin]] and me whenever they pass through, and this time was no different. They even have the nerve to call Merin overrated! He's outraged! Isn't that right friend?|[[Merlin]]|It is a fool's pastime to pay mind to those who only wish to get a rise out of you.|He's putting on a brave face, but, I assure you, he is quite upset!|Sir Cadogan on how [[Fred and George Weasley]] insulted his and Merlin's paintings|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
During the return of [[William Weasley]] to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], George and Fred went missing, and during [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Charles Weasley]]'s searches, they come to [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]]'s painting. At first he pretended to be unwilling to help them because of the twins' rude personality and insulting him and Merlin, but after asking Jacob's sibling that would have they helped if they were in his shoes, he admitted that a knight must help others in need, no matter what. While helping, he also admitted that he challenged the twins into a duel but they just had laughed and left.<ref name="HM65">{{HM|6|5}}</ref>

Also during this [[1989–1990 school year|school year]], Sir Cadogan's portrait conversed with Jacob's sibling on the Grand Staircase, where he informed them that [[Beatrice Haywood]] often came to the staircase to observe the canvas she had been prior [[Portrait curse|trapped]] in. He compared her to a [[Wyvern]] observing a flock of [[sheep]].<ref name="HM626">{{HM|6|26}}</ref>

====1993–1994====

[[File:Sir cadogan1.png|246x246px|thumb|Sir Cadogan leading the trio to the Divination class room]]
In [[1993]], Cadogan first met Harry while looking for the [[Divination Classroom]]. At first thinking him and his friends intruders to be vanquished, Cadogan perked up instantly upon them requesting directions to [[Divination (class)|Divination]]. Glad of the 'quest', Sir Cadogan led the way to the classroom through various paintings, startling a number of women in crinolines as he dashed through their portrait, before bidding them farewell.<ref name="POA6"/> Later, after [[Sirius Black]] attacked the [[Fat Lady]]'s portrait in an attempt to enter [[Gryffindor Tower]], Sir Cadogan was appointed to be the guardian of Gryffindor Tower until Black was caught, mainly because nobody else wanted the job. Several students complained about how he constantly challenged students to duels and his changing of the passwords - he was known for thinking up ridiculously complicated [[password]]s, and changing them several times a day, but [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], [[Head of Gryffindor House]], ignored this as there was no other option.<ref name="POA9">{{POA|B|9}}</ref> At [[Christmas]] that year, Cadogan was enjoying a Christmas party with a couple of monks, several previous [[Headmaster]]s and his pony in his portrait.<ref name="POA11">{{POA|B|11}}</ref> After Sir Cadogan allowed Sirius Black (who had gained possession of [[Neville Longbottom]]'s list of passwords for the week) to enter Gryffindor Tower,<ref name="POA13">{{POA|B|13}}</ref> he was promptly fired as a door guard and returned to the seventh floor. The Fat Lady's portrait was restored by this time and she returned to her job on the grounds that she gets some protection. As a result, several trained [[Security troll]]s were hired to patrol her [[Fat Lady's Corridor|corridor]].<ref name="POA14">{{POA|B|14}}</ref>

====1995–1996====
In the [[1995–1996 school year]], Harry Potter had met him, but he merely walked on and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighbouring picture. He was rebuffed by its inhabitant, [[Painting of a wolfhound|a large and angry-looking wolfhound]].<ref name="OOTP12">{{OOTP|B|12}}</ref>

====1996–1997====
In the [[1996–1997 school year]], [[Damara Dodderidge]] seemed to have developed a crush on Sir Cadogan, calling him "''dashing''".<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

====Battle of Hogwarts====
[[File:Sir cadogan2.png|thumb|250px|Sir Cadogan running through portraits alongside Harry Potter|left]]
On [[2 May]] [[1998]], during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Sir Cadogan shouted encouragement to Harry and the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] defenders, as he ran through the castle, telling Harry to drive out the [[Death Eaters]], to whom he referred as "[[dog]]s", "scoundrels", "braggarts" and "rogues".<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Name "Cadogan" means "glory in battle" from Welsh ''cad'', "battle" and ''gwogawn'', "glory", "honour". In the Mabinogion, a collection of tales from Welsh myth, this name is briefly mentioned as the son of Iddon.

A street called Cadogan Road exists in the Liberton area of Rowling's home city of Edinburgh.

==Behind the scenes==
*Sir Cadogan appears in {{POA|FA}} and is portrayed by [[Paul Whitehouse]]. He also appears in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|video game adaptation]] of the same book. Paul Whitehouse has subsequently appeared as Sir Cadogan in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' video game]] and [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' video game]], although he does not speak.
*On the DVD version of {{POA|FA}}, there is a game called ''The Quest of Sir Cadogan'', which focuses on him travelling through portraits to get to the Gryffindor Common Room to take the place of the Fat Lady as guardian of the tower, having various misadventures en route. The player must guide Sir Cadogan through the portraits by choosing between two paths at certain points, in which choosing the right path will help him save time, and choosing the wrong path will result in him performing a time wasting and usually comical action. For example, when Sir Cadogan runs toward the top of a spiral staircase, the right path will send him sliding down the banister (before proceeding to fall off and tumble down the stair and sliding to a stop), and the wrong one will make him vault over the banister, plummet towards the floor, make a large, knight-shaped hole on impact, stagger around, then pass out. The player will also have to play a selection of mini-games, such as throwing [[Quaffle]]s in [[Quidditch]], or selecting the order in which a series of potions bubble. During the quest, the player can grab clocks, to save time, or [[Time-Turner]]s, to redo a certain section they did badly on. At the end of the game the player will be awarded one of three different ranks: Page, Squire, or Knight of the Realm. The rank achieved depends on the route the player took, how well they did in the mini-games and how many clocks they grabbed.
*Cadogan is a family name of [[Wales|Welsh]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] origin.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/cadogan "Cadogan"] at [http://www.behindthename.com/ Behind the Name]</ref> This could mean that Sir Cadogan's family — at least on the paternal side — hailed from Wales or Ireland. Whether Sir Cadogan himself was Welsh or Irish is unconfirmed.
**However, it is likely he is Irish, as his wand, said to be that of [[Blackthorn]] [[Wand wood|wood]], is made of the same wood as a shillelagh, which is seen as a symbol of Irishness.
*During the scene, in which the [[Fat Lady]] is missing in the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', Sir Cadogan can be seen in portraits on the background. When the Fat Lady attempts to shatter the glass by screaming, he draws the sword and looks around wildly, apparently thinking he's under attack. 
*While Sir Cadogan's role as Gryffindor's portrait was omitted from the theatrical release of the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', it was filmed and included as a deleted scene. He is also asked by [[Professor]] [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]] if he let [[Sirius Black]] in whilst roaming the portraits in the common room; whilst responding, he does questionable things to a woman (ironically, the painting depicts a younger Minerva McGonagall and seems a little flattered by his attention) before handing her cat back to her, then checkmates a game of chess by scattering the pieces and in a final glorious gesture, accidentally knocks a bewigged witch out an open window.
*The [[Portrait]] of [[Damara Dodderidge]] appears to have a soft spot for him, as she often calls him "dashing". 
*Inter-house friendships in Hogwarts are not uncommon, but (as mentioned above) Sir Cadogan struck a friendship with Merlin despite the former being in Gryffindor and the latter being in Slytherin. This inter-house pairing is quite significant because for many years afterwards Gryffindor and Slytherin students were almost rivals. However, it could be that this was before Salazar Slytherin left Hogwarts. 
*The [http://harrypotter.scholastic.com/glossary/ glossary] on the [[Scholastic]] official website incorrectly claims that Sir Cadogan's portrait is hung in the [[North Tower]], a confusion perhaps arising from the fact that this is where he led Harry, Ron, and Hermione during their first meeting.
