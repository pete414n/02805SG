{{Quote|Step away from your [[cauldron]]s, please, the examination is over.|Griselda Marchbanks oversees the [[1996]] [[Potions (class)|Potions]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

'''Madam Professor Griselda Marchbanks''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], who served as Governor of the [[Wizarding Examinations Authority]] that ran the [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]], [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] and [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T.]] examinations from the late [[19th century]] to, at least, the early [[21st century]]. Before resigning in [[1995]], Madam Marchbanks was one of the [[Wizengamot]] elders.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Griselda Marchbanks was born no later than the [[1870s]]. She presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]] in her youth, where she would have received her [[magic]]al education.

===Professional life===
{{Quote|Examined ''[Dumbledore]'' personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s… Did things with a wand I'd never seen before.|Marchbanks remarking on [[Albus Dumbledore]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:Outstanding WOMBAT.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T.]] exam paper, naming Professor Marchbanks as Governor of the [[Wizarding Examinations Authority|W.E.A.]]]]By the late [[1890s]], Professor Marchbanks was already working for the [[Wizarding Examinations Authority]] in the capacity of examiner. She personally tested [[Albus Dumbledore]] in both his [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] and [[Charms (class)|Charms]] practical [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test]]s. She held Dumbledore in great esteem from then on as he did magic she had never seen the likes of before.

In its [[29 November]] [[1926]] issue, the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' published an interview with Marchbanks, in which she expressed her disappointment with recent poor test outcomes in [[Charms (class)|Charms]].

At some point in her life, Marchbanks became a member of the [[Wizengamot]] and was, until 1995, one of its oldest members. She was also a friend of [[Augusta Longbottom]], and was very much like her in terms of personality.

====1995–1996 school year====
{{Quote|Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge's office. This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus Dumbledore.|Griselda Marchbanks to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' in [[1995]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Before the year began, Harry Potter (whom the Ministry had actively been trying to discredit along with Dumbledore) was brought before the [[Wizengamot]] to stand trial for using the [[Patronus Charm]] in the presence of a Muggle; the assembly likely included Madam Marchbanks. When Dumbledore appeared to defend Harry, two witches (possibly Marchbanks and another) waved at him in welcome, and when the verdict was to be given, she likely voted to clear Harry of all charges given her support for Dumbledore.

On [[8 September]] [[1995]], with the passage of [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three]], [[Dolores Umbridge]] was appointed [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] by then-[[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]].

[[File:MarchbanksSubversiveGoblinGroups.png|217x217px|thumb|right|A [[1995]] ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' article: "''Madam Marchbank'' [sic] ''Denies Links to Subversive Goblin Groups''"]]
Later that school year, [[Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]] became [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of Hogwarts. When Marchbanks arrived at the [[Hogwarts Castle|Castle]] with her colleagues from the [[Wizarding Examinations Authority|W.E.A.]] to administer the [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] Examinations, she showed no signs of respect for Umbridge, dismissing her attempts at flattery and expressing scorn at the belief that the Ministry could catch [[Albus Dumbledore]]. She examined a variety of students in [[Harry Potter]]'s year, including [[Draco Malfoy]] in his [[Charms (class)|Charms]] practical, [[Harry Potter]] in his [[Divination]] practical and all the fifth-years in the [[Potions (class)|Potions]] and [[Astronomy (class)|Astronomy]] practicals; during the latter, she likely witnessed the failed assault on [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and the near-fatal injury of Minerva McGonagall by Umbridge and several corrupt [[Auror]]s, including [[John Dawlish]]. It is not known whether she was reinstated in the Wizengamot after the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and subsequent sacking of [[Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]] or not.

Marchbanks was said to be friends with [[Lucius Malfoy]] for many years, and in [[1996]], she went to [[Malfoy Manor]] for dinner. From the way Draco boasted about "it's who you know" and not "what you know", it was likely the dinner was arranged to win favour with Marchbanks and persuade her to award Draco a higher O.W.L. grade in the exam.

====After the war====
After the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], for which she remained alive through, Marchbanks continued to work in the [[Wizarding Examinations Authority|W.E.A.]] in her post of Governor.

==Physical appearance==
Prof. Marchbanks was described as a short and very elderly witch.

==Personality and traits==
She took her role as an examiner very seriously and conducted her tests fairly, not being swayed by close relationships or bribes despite what Draco Malfoy thought. She was a friend and supporter of [[Albus Dumbledore]] having known him since testing him during his time as a student where she was, and continues to be, impressed by his incredible [[magic]]al talents. She was not afraid to vocalise her disdain for the Ministry's treatment of Dumbledore, and showed confidence that they would not have a chance at capturing him. According to [[Neville Longbottom]], she was a tough and strict woman much like his grandmother [[Augusta Longbottom]].

==Behind the scenes==
*Professor Marchbanks was ancient in age by the year [[1996]], as she examined [[Albus Dumbledore]] during his [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]] in [[1899]]. [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T.]] claimed she was still working placing her approximate age today at least in her 130s, and likely even older.
*Along with the other [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] examiners, Professor Marchbanks was omitted from {{OOTP|FA}}. However, [[Dolores Umbridge]] is seen supervising the [[Charms (class)|Charms]] theory exam.
*In [http://atrossbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-2nd-draft.pdf an early draft] of the fifth film, Professor Marchbanks was male.

==Etymology==
The name "Griselda" is possibly derived from the Germanic elements gris "grey" and hild "battle". It is not attested as a Germanic name. This was the name of a patient wife in medieval tales by Boccaccio and Chaucer.
