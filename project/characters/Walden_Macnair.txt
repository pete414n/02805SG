'''Walden Macnair''' was a [[Dark Wizard]] and one of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s early [[Death Eaters]], who fought in the [[First Wizarding War]]. Macnair did not search for Voldemort after his first downfall, but this was forgiven after Voldemort's [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]]. He managed to avoid [[Azkaban]], and worked for the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] as an Executioner. 

He participated in his master's rebirth in [[1995]] and also fought in many battles during the [[Second Wizarding War]], such as the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], after which he was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]]. He escaped in [[1997]] and fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where he was thrown against a wall by [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. His fate after Voldemort's final defeat is unknown.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Walden Macnair was born before or in [[1953]]. At some point during the [[1970s]], Macnair joined the [[Death Eaters]]. 

===First Wizarding War===
During the First Wizarding War, Macnair served as one of Voldemort's followers. After Voldemort's defeat, Macnair, like many Death Eaters, claimed that he had been under the [[Imperius Curse]], and thus did not serve the Dark Lord willingly, in order to avoid going to [[Azkaban]]. He did not search for Voldemort after his downfall.

===Employment by the Ministry===
{{Dialogue a-b|Macnair|Someone untied him! We should search the grounds, the forest.|Albus Dumbledore|Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot?|Macnair's anger at being denied the chance to execute Buckbeak|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
After his defence was accepted, Macnair went to work for the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] as executioner for the [[Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures]], a job suited for his disposition.

[[File:Harry-potter4-Walden Macnair.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Macnair sharpening his axe shortly before Buckbeak's execution]]
Macnair was present during the trial of Rubeus Hagrid's pet [[Hippogriff]] [[Buckbeak]] and was there when Buckbeak was sentenced to death. Macnair was assigned the job of executing Buckbeak. Though this execution was later thwarted by [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Harry Potter]] when [[Albus Dumbledore]] told them they could save two innocent lives by using Hermione's [[Time-Turner]], which they did, which resulted in freeing Buckbeak and Macnair never actually executing him. Dumbledore then dismissed Macnair, as his services would no longer be required at the present time.

[[File:Harry-potter4-movie-buckbeak execution.jpg|250px|thumb|Macnair, Fudge, Dumbledore and Hagrid shocked about Buckbeak's escape]]
Macnair expressed his disappointment at being denied the opportunity to execute the [[Hippogriff]] by burying his axe on [[Hagrid's Hut]] wooden fence in frustration before his departure. Macnair was later sent by [[Cornelius Fudge]] to get the [[Dementor]]s after [[Sirius Black]] was caught and imprisoned only to find Black gone as well when he returned with them. This was because, unknown to Macnair or Fudge, Harry and Hermione flew Buckbeak up to the tower window and freed Black from inside, sending both the Hippogriff and Azkaban escapee away from Hogwarts and into hiding.

===Second Wizarding War===
{{Dialogue a-b|Lord Voldemort|Macnair… destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide…|Walden Macnair|Thank you, Master… thank you.|Voldemort viciously greeting his Death Eaters in Little Hangleton|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
In [[1994]] Hogwarts held a [[Triwizard Tournament]], a dangerous tournament with challenging tasks. Harry Potter, the boy who defeated Voldemort was a champion of this tournament. That year at Hogwarts, Voldemort had one of his followers [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] pose as new Professor of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[Alastor Moody]]. "Alastor Moody" was successful in getting Harry Potter to be transported to the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]], where [[Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] would perform the rebirth of Lord Voldemort on [[24 June]], [[1995]]. 

[[File:Wormtail graveyard.png|250px|thumb|left|Death Eaters watching as Voldemort's duel with Harry Potter resulted in Priori Incantatem]]
Once reborn, Voldemort called for his Death Eaters and Macnair answered the call and arrived at Little Hangleton. Voldemort expressed his disappointment in Macnair for not staying loyal and for working in the Ministry, but allowed Macnair to rejoin in his ranks, promising him human victims to kill as opposed to [[creature]]s. Macnair was grateful to his master for his forgiveness. Harry later tried to name Macnair as a Death Eater to Cornelius Fudge, who took offence to the accusation due to Macnair's employment to the Ministry.

In the summer of 1995 Albus Dumbledore had set [[Rubeus Hagrid]] a [[Mission to the Giant colony|mission]] to gather [[giant]]s in preparation for the [[Second Wizarding War]]. However, Hagrid's mission was interrupted by Walden Macnair and another unknown Death Eater. Macnair was also on a mission to rally giants for the war, but Macnair was acting under the orders of the Dark Lord and, unlike Hagrid, completed his mission successfully and managed to obtain the giants' support. This was due to the [[Gurg]] of the giants, [[Golgomath]], as he was a violent creature who loved killing as much as Macnair, and the two were able to get along fine. Golgomath also told Macnair and his comrades that Hagrid and [[Olympe Maxime]] were in the area, and the Death Eaters attempted to weed them out, but the two half-giants managed to escape.

====Murder of Broderick Bode====
[[Broderick Bode]], an [[Unspeakable]] of the [[Department of Mysteries]] was placed under the [[Imperius Curse]] late in 1995 by [[Lucius Malfoy]] and was ordered to remove the Prophecy from its place in the [[Hall of Prophecy]]. When he touched the Prophecy Record, however, the defensive spells around it were triggered and he suffered spell damage that affected his mind, causing him to believe he was a teapot. Bode was then sent to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] where he was gradually regaining his health.

On [[24 December|Christmas Eve]] of that same year, Macnair went to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], disguised as a "''very old stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet''". Knowing Bode would eventually regain his speech and lucidity, Macnair was ordered to leave him a pot of [[Devil's Snare]] (that was mistaken for a harmless pot of [[Flitterbloom]] by [[Healer]] [[Miriam Strout]]) and a [[fancy hippogriff calendar]].

Upon touching the Devil's Snare, Bode was strangled by it, and was found dead in his bed in the next morning.

====The Department of Mysteries====
{{Quote|We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary...|[[Lucius Malfoy]] gives orders to the group of Death Eaters|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix- Macnair.jpg|250px|thumb|Macnair in the Department of Mysteries holding [[Luna Lovegood]] hostage]]
Macnair was amongst the Death Eaters gathered to participate in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in [[1996]]. Macnair was paired with [[Avery II|Avery]] in the battle's chase though their actions are mostly unknown. In the [[Death Chamber]] Macnair was one of the ten Death Eaters who surrounded [[Harry Potter]] before being confronted by members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. While his comrades fought the Order members, Macnair grabbed Harry by his throat and nearly managed to snatch the [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] from him. However, [[Neville Longbottom]] prevented him, by shoving [[Hermione Granger's wand]] through Macnair's Death Eater mask's eye-hole, causing him great pain and forcing him to let go of Harry. Afterwards, Harry hit him with a [[Stunning Spell]], before he could regain his composure.

Following the battle, it is presumed that a stunned Macnair was found and imprisoned in Azkaban. Though he would only spend a short time in Azkaban as he was known to be once again at large again by the summer of [[1997]].

====Battle of Hogwarts====
{{Quote|I know that you are preparing to fight. Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood. Give me [[Harry Potter]] and none shall be harmed.|Lord Voldemort to the residents of Hogwarts shortly before he attacks|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Pottermore Death Eaters Forbidden Forest.png|250px|thumb|left|Death Eaters in the forest waiting for Harry Potter to arrive]]
In [[1998]] when Harry Potter returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] after a [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|long search]] for Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es, Voldemort's army of [[Death Eaters]], [[Snatchers]] and other [[creature]]s attacked the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]], in an battle known as the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Many Hogwarts staff members and students managed to put up a good defence, but Macnair accompanied by many other [[Death Eaters]] was able to get inside the school grounds and into the castle, where they engaged in a violent and bloody conflict. 

Macnair was seen by Harry Potter at the [[Great Hall]] during the battle when [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who presumably remembered him from both [[Buckbeak]]'s trial and the giant [[Mission to the Giant colony|mission]], threw him across the Hall and against a wall, knocking him unconscious. Shortly after, Macnair's master was defeated and killed by [[Harry Potter]]. 

====The Calamity====
Macnair somehow survived the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and was presumably imprisoned back in [[Azkaban]] for his crimes committed as a Death Eater. He was still alive by the [[2010s]], and he provided long interviews at undisclosed locations to trainee [[Auror]]s working for the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] who were trying to combat the [[Calamity]], about his time working for Lord Voldemort.

==Physical appearance==
Macnair was described as tall and muscular, with a thin, black moustache. In [[1996]], during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], he attempted to strangle Harry Potter, but was stopped by [[Neville Longbottom]], who poked him in the eye with Hermione Granger's wand; Macnair's eye became red and swollen. As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm, which would have faded to a mere scar upon Voldemort's death.

When visiting [[Broderick Bode]] to murder him, he disguised himself as an elderly stooped wizard who required a hearing trumpet.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Maniac, he is. Likes killin' as much as [[Golgomath]]. No wonder they got along so well.|Walden's violent tendencies|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Macnair was described by [[Rubeus Hagrid]] as very violent and bloodthirsty. He became an executioner primarily out of his fondness for killing. This was an interest shared by [[Golgomath]] (the [[Gurg]] of the [[Giant]]s) that Macnair parleyed with on Voldemort's behalf. He expressed his disappointment at being denied the opportunity to execute [[Buckbeak]] the [[Hippogriff]], by swinging his axe into a wooden post before his departure. He also appeared to be rather brutal in his methods such as when he violently grabbed [[Harry Potter]] by the throat when attempting to get the prophecy. Despite his viciousness and sadism, he did not seem to be one of the more loyal Death Eaters, as he did not search for his master following his original defeat. He was shown to be quite sycophantic to his master following his rebirth, where Voldemort promised to give him human victims to kill.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Macnair was capable of apparition, as shown when he apparated to Voldemort's side following his [[Return of Lord Voldemort|rebirth]] in the [[Little Hangleton Graveyard]].
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, Macnair was very accomplished in dark magic and with the casting of [[dark charm]]s. He was able to perform the [[Unforgivable Curses]] (which require ability and genuine malice to perform), including the [[Cruciatus Curse]] as well as the [[Killing Curse]].
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Macnair was a very capable duellist, as he fought in both the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] along with other Death Eaters, showing him to have been skilled in [[martial magic]]. 

==Possessions==
*'''[[Walden Macnair's wand|Wand]]''': Macnair owned a [[wand]] that was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material.
*'''[[Axe]]''': Macnair owned a sharp cutting axe for his job as a professional [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] [[executioner]].

==Behind the scenes==

[[File:MacnairLEGO.png|150px|thumb|right|Walden Macnair as a {{LEGO}} mini-figure]]
*Macnair was portrayed by [[Peter Best]] in the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', although another actor, [[Ashley Artus]], briefly portrayed him in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''. 
*In the film adaptation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', there is a scene in which Harry and his friends pass by Macnair sharpening his axe before he notices them and gives Harry an unnerving smile. It's possible that this scene was included to foreshadow Macnair's role as a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]].
*In one edition of {{GOF}}, Macnair's name was spelt as it was in {{POA}} during the churchyard scene, but was later mentioned by [[Harry Potter]] as "McNair". This was later corrected.
*In the films, Macnair isn't very muscular and has no moustache, though Ashley Artus's portrayal has a beard. He also has no speaking lines in the films.
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] is considerably different from that of the novel. Macnair is shown holding [[Luna Lovegood]] hostage at one point, which did not occur in the book.
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Macnair is an unlockable character.
