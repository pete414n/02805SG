'''Seamus Finnigan''' (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], son of [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Seamus Finnigan's father|Mr Finnigan]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] witch [[Seamus Finnigan's mother|Mrs Finnigan]]. Mr Finnigan did not learn this until after they were married and it gave him a "nasty shock" when he first learned it.

Seamus was a [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was also the best friend of [[Dean Thomas]]. Seamus originally doubted [[Harry Potter]]'s claim that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned in [[1995]] (as his mother doubted it). However, late in 1996 he eventually joined [[Dumbledore's Army]]. The D.A. was an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. Seamus joined after apologising to Harry.

In [[1997]] he continued his [[seventh year]] of education at Hogwarts, although the school was under the control of Voldemort. Seamus remained in the D.A. and fought bravely in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. It is currently unknown what he did after the [[Second Wizarding War]].




Seamus was born to Muggle [[Seamus Finnigan's father|Mr Finnigan]] and his witch [[Seamus Finnigan's mother|wife]] at some point between the September of [[1979]] and the August of [[1980]]. It was mentioned that Seamus' father had no idea that his wife was a witch before they married and it "came as a nasty shock to him when he found out", but nevertheless accepted it.

Seamus came from an [[Ireland|Irish]] family (as suggested by his name) and as shown in the Quidditch World Cup he attended just before his fourth year. It is possible that Seamus was from [[Kenmare]], County Kerry due to his support of the [[Kenmare Kestrels|local Quidditch team]]. and him and his mother support of the [[Irish National Quidditch team]] in the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]. He had an older cousin named [[Fergus]], who would frequently [[Apparition|Apparate]] just to annoy him. Seamus had plans to annoy Fergus back, once he passed his [[Apparition (class)|apparition test]].


First year



Seamus arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September]] [[1991]]. Other students in [[First year|his year]] included [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Draco Malfoy]]. When [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] asked the first years to form a line to head into the [[Great Hall]], Seamus ended up in front of Harry Potter. When Seamus' name was called during the [[Sorting ceremony]], he waited for almost a minute before the [[Sorting Hat]] placed him into [[Gryffindor]]. After joining the Gryffindor table, Seamus was introduced to the Gryffindor house [[ghost]] [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]], who students often called "Nearly Headless Nick." Seamus asked how one could be "nearly" headless, to which Nick demonstrated by pulling his head off of his neck, which disgusted most of the table.


During his first [[Potions (class)|Potions]] lesson the next Friday, Seamus was partnered with [[Neville Longbottom]] to brew a [[Cure for Boils|Boil-Cure Potion]]. Neville managed to melt Seamus' cauldron and was drenched in their potion. [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] told Seamus to take Neville to the [[Hospital Wing]], which he did.

When the Gryffindor first years learned about their first [[Flying (class)|flying lesson]] with [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]], Seamus bragged that in his youth he spent most of his time flying around the countryside. along with Harry Potter|alt|left]]During [[Charms (class)|Charms class]] on [[31 October|Hallowe'en]] morning, Seamus was partnered with Harry to practise the Levitation Charm. While practising, Seamus managed to [[Bangs-and-smells magic|set fire to their feather]] with his [[Seamus Finnigan's wand|wand]], and Harry had to put it out with his hat. Seamus would have many such experiences throughout his school career.


When Harry was preparing for his first [[Quidditch]] match, Seamus joined in to try and get Harry to eat something for breakfast. He insisted Harry needed his strength because [[Seeker]]s were the most frequent target of physical attacks. Harry acquiesced, and Seamus piled ketchup onto his sausages. Out on the pitch, Seamus joined Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Dean in the top row of seats. When Harry's broom became enchanted by [[Quirinus Quirrell]], Seamus was impressed (as was the rest of Gryffindor) that Harry managed to stay on the broom.

Before leaving Hogwarts for the Christmas holiday, Seamus lent Harry his [[Wizard's Chess]] pieces so Harry could learn how to play. After the [[1992|new year]], Seamus returned for his next term. When Neville arrived in Gryffindor Tower with his [[Leg-Locker Curse|legs stuck together]], Seamus was among those who burst into laughter.

Before getting on the [[Hogwarts Express]] to leave for the summer, Seamus, along with the rest of the school, was given a warning not to use magic when back at home.

Second year
 in Gilderoy Lockhart's first DADA lesson|alt]]

On 1 September, Seamus boarded the [[Hogwarts Express]] to begin his second year at school. When [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] arrived at school via [[Arthur Weasley]]'s [[Flying Ford Anglia|flying car]], Seamus was one of the students who expressed admiration at the result. In [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s first [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson, in which he showed the class a cage of [[Pixie|Cornish pixies]], Seamus asked if they were dangerous or not. Instead of giving the class a straight answer, Lockhart showed them by letting them loose; most of the class, including Seamus, dove for cover. Seamus was among the students who bolted for the door when the bell rang and escaped the task of putting the pixies back in their cage, leaving the trio to take care of it.

During a [[History of Magic]] lesson, Seamus asked [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]] if anyone other than the "[[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]]" would be capable of finding the [[Chamber of Secrets]], to which Binns dismissed his concern, saying that no Hogwarts [[Headmaster|Headteacher]] had ever located the Chamber within the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]].

Seamus later attended the first (and only) meeting of Lockhart's [[Duelling Club]]. He was partnered with Ron, and at one point, Ron's damaged wand malfunctioned and knocked Seamus to the ground. Ron helped Seamus to his feet, apologising profusely. When Harry and [[Draco Malfoy]] were chosen to demonstrate blocking spells, Seamus and the rest of the class learned that Harry could [[Parseltongue|speak with snakes]].

Third year

A few days before the start of term, Seamus arrived in [[Diagon Alley]] to purchase his school books. With [[Dean Thomas]], he saw [[Harry Potter]] in [[Quality Quidditch Supplies]], where they were ogling the newly released [[Firebolt]] broomstick.

In his first [[Divination (class)|Divination]] lesson with [[Sybill Trelawney]], the class debated whether or not she had seen a [[Grim]] in Harry's teacup. Tilting his head from side to side, Seamus expressed his opinion that, tilted right, the tea leaves did resemble a Grim, but tilted left, it looked more like a donkey. In his first [[Potions (class)|Potions]] lesson, Seamus told Harry and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] that Sirius Black, an escaped [[Azkaban]] convict, had been spotted near the school. Looking excited, he informed them that a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] woman had spotted Black and called the special hot line set up by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

After lunch, Seamus had his first [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson with [[Remus Lupin]]. When Seamus' turn came to face a [[Boggart]], the [[Non-Human Spiritous Apparition|non-being]] turned into a [[banshee]] with floor-length black hair and a skeletal green face, representing his greatest inner fear. When the banshee began to shriek, Seamus used the ''[[Boggart-Banishing Spell|Riddikulus]]'' [[charm]] to take her voice away; for his participation, Seamus earned five [[House points]].


On [[Hallowe'en]], Seamus paid his first visit to [[Hogsmeade]] with the rest of the third years. It can be assumed that he largely spend this trip with his best friend Dean. When the [[Gryffindor]]s learned that Sirius Black had attacked the [[Fat Lady]], they were all sent back to the [[Great Hall]]. Once in the hall they were joined by the other Houses, in an attempt to keep the students safe. With the rest of Gryffindor, Seamus was aggravated by the choice of [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]] to guard the House's portrait hole calling him a "lunatic". When Seamus complained to [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] [[Percy Weasley]], Percy replied that Sir Cadogan was the only one who willingly volunteered for the job, as he was unbalanced.


Along with most of the school, Seamus went home for the Christmas holidays. When he returned he was impressed that Harry had received a [[Firebolt]] for Christmas. When Harry went down to breakfast the morning of his first Quidditch match with the broom, Seamus served as a "guard of honour" to protect the broom. After the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] defeated [[Ravenclaw]], Seamus was very happy and cheered Harry, along with the other Gryffindors. Seamus was also awoken in the boys' dormitory when Ron announced that Sirius Black had [[Sirius Black's break-in of Hogwarts Castle (1994)|broken into]] the dormitory with a [[Sirius Black's knife|knife]].

When Professor Lupin resigned at the end of the year, after being exposed as a [[werewolf]], Seamus was among the students who were sorry to see him go, along with the other Gryffindor students.

Fourth year

 
Over the summer of [[1994]], Seamus and his mother, along with Dean, attended the [[Quidditch World Cup]] between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Ireland]]. Being Irish, the pair obviously supported the latter; their tent was covered with shamrocks. When Seamus ran into [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], they assured him that they would be supporting Ireland, as well. Presumably Seamus was delighted when the [[Irish National Quidditch team]] won.

By the start of term, Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette; it still called out the names of the Irish players, albeit feebly and exhaustedly. At the Welcoming Feast, Seamus learned that the [[Triwizard Tournament]] would be held at Hogwarts that year. Seamus' first day of classes did not sit well with him. In his first class, [[Herbology]], he was required to collect bubotuber pus for [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]]. In his next class, [[Care of Magical Creatures]], he was required to help look after Hagrid's newly bred [[Blast-Ended Skrewt]]s.

When Harry's name mysteriously came out of the [[Goblet of Fire]], Seamus was among the students who believed Harry had tricked the Goblet into letting him compete. On [[25 December|Christmas Day]], Seamus attended the [[Yule Ball]] with [[Lavender Brown]].

Fifth year
 over Voldemort's return]]

On his first night back at school, Seamus got into an argument with Harry Potter about the latter's claim of Lord Voldemort's return. A devout reader of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', Seamus's mother believed what the papers were saying about Harry and [[Albus Dumbledore]], and had been very reluctant to allow Seamus to return to school. When Seamus asked Harry what really happened that night, Harry snapped at him to read the ''Prophet'' like his mother. When [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] arrived to break the argument up, Seamus thought that, for believing Harry, Ron was as insane as Harry was.

After Harry's interview with [[Rita Skeeter]] appeared in ''[[The Quibbler]]'', Seamus apologised for his behaviour. He told Harry that he now believed Voldemort was back and had sent a copy of Harry's interview to his mother. Seamus and Harry were soon friends again.
When the students returned to school after Christmas break, Dean Thomas led Seamus to attend his first meeting of [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Seamus was thrilled when he managed to conjure a full [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]. It disappeared after only a few moments, but was "something hairy." When [[Dobby]] the [[house-elf]] arrived to warn the group about [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s pending arrival, Seamus managed to escape with most of the others.

In the spring of [[1996]], Seamus sat his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exams.

Sixth year


In the autumn of 1996, Seamus tried out for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] as a [[Chaser]]. When [[Katie Bell]] was sent to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] after touching a cursed necklace, Seamus was among the students who disapproved of Harry's choice of [[Dean Thomas]] as her replacement; Harry was initially against it, as well, because he knew Seamus would not like it. However, Harry felt it was the right choice, because Dean had outflown Seamus during the try-outs.

When the sixth years learned about [[Apparition (class)|Apparition]] lessons in the spring of 1997, Seamus was among the group of students who were impressed that [[Harry Potter]] had already experienced it through [[Apparition|Side-Along Apparition]] with Albus Dumbledore.

 that Seamus attended]]

Seamus was not one of the [[Dumbledore's Army]] members that answered the call to arms when [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] was invaded by [[Death Eaters]], as he did not keep his DA coin on himself at all times. After Dumbledore was killed by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], Seamus refused to return until after the funeral wanting to pay his respects and say goodbye to his former headmaster, despite his mother insisting he returned home at once.

Seventh year


]]

While [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] were gone searching for [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es, Seamus returned to the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]-controlled Hogwarts for his seventh year. He greatly missed his best friend [[Dean Thomas]], who was forced to go on the run because of his presumed [[Muggle-born]] status. Seamus was part of the restored Dumbledore's Army, who ended up staying in the [[Room of Requirement]] to escape the [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow|Carrows]]. 

The school year was incredibly difficult for Dumbledore's Army. He, along with many others, started to show the cost of standing up to the new regime at Hogwarts: Seamus' face was so bruised that when Harry returned to the school in May of [[1998]], Seamus was unrecognisable until he spoke.

Battle of Hogwarts




When Voldemort's army attacked the castle, Seamus was among many of those who stayed to fight. He was charged with blowing up the [[Wooden Bridge]] to prevent [[Snatchers]] from entering the school. 

During the Battle of Hogwarts, Seamus, [[Luna Lovegood]], and [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] saved Harry, Ron, and Hermione from hundreds of [[Dementor]]s by casting the [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] to hold them back, before Harry drove them away with his own. His Patronus was in the form of a fox. 

Seamus, Leanne, Katie Bell, and others were also seen being led into battle by Aberforth Dumbledore sometime during the opening stages of the battle.



Seamus was among the students to witness Hagrid carry Harry's "dead" body back to the school grounds, when Neville shouted "Dumbledore's Army," Seamus was among those in the crowd that roared with cheers, provoking Voldemort. 

Afterward, when the second stage of the fighting began, and Lord Voldemort himself had stepped in, Harry saved Seamus and [[Hannah Abbott]]'s lives when [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] had sent a curse their way. Seamus also witnessed Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the Second Wizarding War.




He survived the Second Wizarding War and was seen sitting with Dean Thomas and [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] once the battle had ended. It is unknown what happened to him after the war. It can be assumed that he attended the [[2014]] reunion of Dumbledore's Army. After the battle he most likely kept his [[Dumbledore's Army coin|D.A. coin]], as a badge of honour, as did other D.A. members.

During the [[Calamity]] that affected the Wizarding World in the 2010s, Seamus appeared as a [[Foundable]], clad in robes for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] tryouts. He was pursued by a [[Fire-breathing chicken]] [[Confoundable]], necessitating the usage of the [[Ebublio Jinx]] by volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] to repel the fowls and return his foundable back to its original place.


Being a Gryffindor, Seamus usually wore a red-and-gold tie and a black jumper along with his black Hogwarts robes. His uniform was always scruffy and untidy, making him look like a slob. During Seamus's final year at Hogwarts, his face had been battered and bruised by the [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow|Carrows]] to an extent that neither Harry nor Dean Thomas could recognise him, until he spoke with his distinct Irish accent. Seamus had sandy coloured hair.






Through his school years, Seamus generally appeared good-natured and easy-going. He was also rather [[Bangs-and-smells magic|clumsy, as he set fire to a feather]] he was supposed to be levitating in his first year. He seems to display traits of more than one Hogwarts house, since the [[Sorting Hat]] had to think for almost a minute before deciding to sort him into Gryffindor. 

Seamus was also rather curious, asking [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] where he got his [[Quirinus Quirrell's turban|turban]], [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] how he could be "nearly headless", and [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] about [[Inferius|Inferi]].

Of all the boys in Harry's dormitory, Seamus was the least enthusiastic supporter of [[Harry Potter]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]], often demonstrating scepticism of Harry's claims. However, after reading Rita Skeeter's interview with Harry in the fifth year, he apologised to Harry and sent a copy to his "mam", as she did not believe that Voldemort was back. He did join [[Dumbledore's Army]] sometime in [[1996]], although he did not sign the actual membership list of the group.

After Dumbledore's death the [[1997|following year]], Seamus insisted on remaining at Hogwarts in order to attend the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] for the fallen headmaster, despite his mother's wish to remove him immediately from the perceived dangers at the school. This demonsted his allegiance to Dumbledore and Harry Potter.

Seamus also demonstrated the characteristic bravery and loyalty of his house by opposing the [[Death Eaters]] at great personal risk during his final year at Hogwarts and in the [[Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]].


 during a D.A. meeting]]

*'''[[Pyrotechnics]]''': Whilst not a specific branch of magic, Seamus was very skilled in his ability to conjure or create [[magic]] that would have a pyrotechnic effect, stemming from his [[Bangs-and-smells magic|various incendiary mishaps]] in his first year. This was demonstrated usefully during the Battle of Hogwarts when Professor McGonagall instructed him and [[Neville Longbottom]] to explode the bridge in the [[Hogwarts Castle#The Grounds|Hogwarts grounds]] using [[charge]]s.



*'''[[Charm]]s''': Seamus achieved a high O.W.L. score in this [[Charms (class)|subject]], which enabled him to attend the N.E.W.T.-level class. In [[1996]], during a Charms lesson, he was able to cast the [[Water-Making Spell]]. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Seamus was able to effectively cast the highly advanced [[Patronus Charm]] - his corporeal Patronus took the form of a [[fox]]. This charm is an incredibly advanced piece of [[magic]] and is proof of superior magical ability.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': As proven by his participation in and surviving the Battle of Hogwarts, Seamus was a highly proficient duellist. He and [[Hannah Abbott|Hannah Abbot]] were described as "joining the fight already flourishing inside it' during the battle. Seamus would have been taught [[martial magic]] by [[Harry Potter]], during the [[Dumbledore's Army]] meetings.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Seamus achieved a high mark on his O.W.L. exam, proving his proficiency in the [[Transfiguration (class)|subject]]. He advanced to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level.
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Seamus achieved a high [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] score in this subject,



*'''[[Seamus Finnigan's wand|Wand]]''': Like all wizards and witches it can be assumed that Seamus's [[wand]] was among his most valued possessions and that he purchased it from [[Ollivanders]] at the age of eleven. His wand was of unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material.
*'''[[Luminous rosette]]''': Seamus owned a green speaking rosette from the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] for the [[Irish National Quidditch team]], the voice of which did not last for very long after the cup.
*'''[[Wizard's Chess]]''': Seamus played this [[magic]]al version of Chess, and owned several chess pieces for it. He lent them to Harry Potter to help him play the game in [[1991]] as they knew he was not an experienced player.





Seamus appeared to have a very close relationship with his family, particularly his [[Seamus Finnigan's mother|mother]]. They attended the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]] together, and one of Seamus's main reasons for doubting [[Harry Potter]]'s story that [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] had returned was his mother's belief in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''s version of events. However, Seamus felt strongly enough about attending [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] to defy his mother's wishes that he return home immediately.




, his best friend]]

Seamus's best friend was [[Dean Thomas]], one of his dormmates, during their first year at Hogwarts, and the two remained best friends throughout their school years. The two were often seen together at school, and Dean attended the Quidditch World Cup with Seamus and his mother in 1994. Seamus initially believed the smear campaign the Ministry of Magic and the ''Daily Prophet'' ran against Harry Potter when he claimed that Voldemort had returned, but this does not appear to have affected his friendship with Dean, who did believe Harry and who eventually managed to get Seamus to attend the final D.A. meeting of the year.

Seamus was also displeased when Dean was chosen as the replacement Chaser for the Gryffindor Quidditch team over him when [[Katie Bell]] was injured, but again, the two still remained close friends. Since Dean could not return to Hogwarts for his final year, the two did not see each other for some time. When Dean eventually did return to Hogwarts in 1998 to fight in the final battle, Seamus was ecstatic to see him, and ran to hug him.




]]

Seamus was also friends with his other roommates, [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Neville Longbottom]], though not to the same extent as with Dean Thomas. He and Harry had small fallings out over Harry being chosen as a [[Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Champion]] and Seamus's doubt over Harry's claim that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned, but managed to patch things up. When Ron had a row with Harry himself about the [[Goblet of Fire]] choosing Harry as a champion, he spent a lot of time with Seamus and Dean. However, when Seamus expressed his disbelief about Harry's statements that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was back, Ron supported Harry and got very angry with Seamus. However, they became friends again.

Seamus also appeared to be friendly with [[Lavender Brown]], whom he took to the [[Yule Ball]] in [[1994]] They may have been romantically involved around that time, though they may have just gone together as friends. Later on, Ron would get romantically involved with Lavender and there were no signs of bitterness between him and Seamus, which may indicate that Seamus and Lavender were never a couple.

Seamus also seemed to have been friendly with classmates and fellow [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] and [[Susan Bones]]; during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], he was frequently seen fighting alongside them, even though his best friend Dean Thomas had returned to Hogwarts. His friendships with Hannah, Susan and Ernie may have became closer when Dean was on the run and he had to make new friends, both Harry and Ron were also absent from school leaving Seamus with only Neville as a friend. Seamus had also met other members of the army, such as [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Katie Bell]], [[Lee Jordan]], [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Colin Creevey|Colin]] and [[Dennis Creevey]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Marietta Edgecombe]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], and [[Zacharias Smith]], although their relationship with Seamus is unknown.


Seamus is an Irish version of the name James, which means "supplanter" (one who takes the place of another, usually by force). Finnigan is an Irish name that includes finn (white, fair) and means "fair-haired one."

*Seamus has been played by Irish actor [[Devon Murray]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'', and both parts of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|Deathly Hallows]]'', and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations.
*In the Philosopher's Stone video game, Seamus (whose name is only mentioned in the dialogue) appears to be a Ravenclaw. Even more curiously he is mostly always seen next to a boy whose appearance matches the movie - Dean Thomas - and who is a Hufflepuff.

*Devon Murray does not fit the physical description given of Seamus Finnigan, but he does have the Irish accent needed for the role.
*A running gag in the films is that Seamus keeps causing things to be set on fire and (sometimes) burning his eyebrows off. In the Philosopher's Stone, he blows up a feather in an attempt to make it levitate. In the Half-Blood Prince, he causes an explosion in his cauldron. This was shown prominently in , as he set up charges on the bridge so they could blow it up. Professor McGonagall states because of his incidents, that he has a penchant for it.
*By the events of ''Deathly Hallows: Part 2'', it appears that he is second in command to [[Neville Longbottom]] in Dumbledore's Army. This is shown when Neville and Seamus lead a group of fighters to the [[Wooden Bridge]] and when he advises Neville to stand down from Voldemort.
*Devon Murray has the record for breaking the most fake wands on the Harry Potter set.
*In , it is Hermione, not Seamus, who asks Sir [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] about his nickname, "Nearly Headless Nick".
