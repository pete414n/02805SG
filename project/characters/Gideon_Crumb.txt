'''Gideon Crumb''' (b. [[1975]]) was the [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who played [[bagpipes]] for the popular wizarding band [[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]].

==Biography==
On [[25 December]] [[1994]], Crumb and his fellow bandmates played during the [[Yule Ball]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. They played songs such as [[Do the Hippogriff]].

==Etymology==
The name "''Gideon''" means "feller" or "hewer" in Hebrew. Gideon was a hero of the Old Testament who led the Israelites against the Midianites. In the English-speaking world, Gideon has been used as a given name since the Protestant Reformation, and it was popular among the Puritans.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Steven Claydon]] played Gideon Crumb in {{GOF|FA}}. In the film, he plays a [[keyboard]] in addition to bagpipes.
*If Gideon attended Hogwarts, then he would have graduated a mere year or less before he played at the [[Yule Ball]]; he would have started at Hogwarts in [[September]] [[1986]] or [[1987]], and thus would have finished in [[June]] [[1993]] or [[1994]].
