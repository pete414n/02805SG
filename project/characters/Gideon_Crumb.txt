'''Gideon Crumb''' (b. [[1975]]) was the [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who played [[bagpipes]] for the popular wizarding band [[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
On [[25 December]] [[1994]], Crumb and his fellow bandmates played during the [[Yule Ball]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="GOF23">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref> They played songs such as [[Do the Hippogriff]].<ref name="GOFF19">{{GOF|F}} - Chapter 19 (''The Yule Ball'')</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "''Gideon''" means "feller" or "hewer" in Hebrew. Gideon was a hero of the Old Testament who led the Israelites against the Midianites. In the English-speaking world, Gideon has been used as a given name since the Protestant Reformation, and it was popular among the Puritans.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Steven Claydon]] played Gideon Crumb in {{GOF|FA}}. In the film, he plays a [[keyboard]] in addition to bagpipes.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporting_Harry_Potter_characters Supporting ''Harry Potter'' characters]" at [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia]</ref>
*If Gideon attended Hogwarts, then he would have graduated a mere year or less before he played at the [[Yule Ball]]; he would have started at Hogwarts in [[September]] [[1986]] or [[1987]], and thus would have finished in [[June]] [[1993]] or [[1994]].
