'''Ronan''' was a male [[centaur]] who lived in the [[Forbidden Forest]].


On the night of [[26 May]] [[1992]], Ronan along with fellow centaur [[Bane]] met [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in the Forbidden Forest, who was investigating that night why [[unicorn]]s in the forest were being slaughtered, although the two centaurs could not explain why and thus were unable to help him.

He was distrustful of [[human]]s, although he tried to protect [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] from the other centaurs in [[1996]], pointing out that they were "foals", during the [[Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest]] involving [[Dolores Umbridge]]. He was described as speaking with a doleful tone, and seemed rather peaceful compared to other centaurs.

He led the charge of the centaurs from the [[Forbidden Forest]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], breaking through the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] ranks into the [[Great Hall]]. It is likely that he witnessed the final battle between [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and Harry Potter.


He was described as having red hair, and a red beard. Below the waist, he had a [[horse]]'s gleaming chestnut body with a long and reddish tail.


'''R칩n치n''' (anglicized '''Ronan''') is an Irish male given name meaning "little seal", ''R칩n'' meaning "seal", and -''치n'' being a diminutive suffix in Irish Gaelic).
