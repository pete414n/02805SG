'''Amos Diggory''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who worked for the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] in the [[British Ministry of Magic]].

After the events of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Amos still had not made peace with the death of his son. In [[2020]], he sought a meeting with [[Harry Potter]], in the hopes of saving his deceased son via a new [[time-turner]] that was discovered.



Amos was born into the wizarding [[Diggory family]] and was the only child of his parents. He presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy]] in his youth, where he would have received his [[magic]]al education. 

He ended up working in the [[Ministry of Magic|British Ministry of Magic]] and by the [[1980s]], he worked for the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]].


During the [[1984–1985 school year]], Amos came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to celebrate [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s [[Rubeus Hagrid's birthday celebration|birthday]]. Shortly before the celebration, he allowed [[Jacob's sibling]] to choose between a [[fire crab]], a [[Murtlap]] and a [[Porlock]] as a birthday present for Hagrid.

During the [[1987–1988 school year]], Amos came to Hogwarts once again to assist [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]] recapturing magical creatures at large all around the castle.



For the [[1990–1991 school year]], [[Hogwarts Headmaster|Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore]] arranged with the Ministry of Magic for some interested [[seventh year]] students to visit the premises for a [[Ministry of Magic student programme|student internship]]. When the students arrived at the Ministry, they were made to report to the All-Purpose Room for orientation. In the room Ministry officials handed out of the recquired credentials permitting students limited, supervised access to designated areas elsewhere at the Ministry. 

The initial head for the student programme was Amos, an investigator at the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], until he lost the position to [[Wilkie Twycross]] of the [[Department of Magical Transportation]].




 [[Quidditch World Cup]]|alt]]

The [[Diggory family]] lived either in or near to the village of [[Ottery St Catchpole]], near the [[Weasley family|Weasley]] and [[Fawcett family|Fawcett]] families. In [[1994]], Amos and his family attended the Quidditch World Cup. After a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] riot broke out, a team of [[Wizardkind|witches and wizards]], including Amos, found the [[house-elf]] [[Winky]] lying beneath the [[Dark Mark]] and questioned her about what happened.

He performed ''[[Reverse Spell|Prior Incantato]]'' on the [[Harry Potter's wand|wand]] of [[Harry Potter]] to deduce who had used the ''[[Morsmordre]]'' [[spell]]. unbeknownst to him, this was the day Moody was kidnapped by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]]. Amos simply thought it was another false alarm from the paranoid Moody and wanted to ensure that the former [[Auror]]'s new job at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] would not be jeopardised.






That same year, Amos's son [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] was selected as Hogwarts's champion in the [[Triwizard Tournament]], something of which Amos was extremely proud. However, [[Harry Potter]]'s name also came out of the [[Goblet of Fire]]. Many people erroneously believed that Harry intentionally tried to cheat Cedric and [[Hufflepuff]] house out of their deserved glory, as he was too young to be selected and received the most publicity. Amos was openly rude to Harry before the tournament's Third Task. He made snide remarks about points to Harry's face. This infuriated [[Molly Weasley]], with whom Amos almost had a public confrontation, but his [[Cedric Diggory's mother|wife]] restrained him.



Harry and Cedric considered themselves to be equally winners at the end of the tournament, thus they both touched the [[Triwizard Cup]], unwittingly taking a [[Portkey]] as part of the trap [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] set for Harry. Harry and Cedric arrived in a graveyard and Voldemort ordered his servant [[Peter Pettigrew]] to murder Cedric. Pettigrew murdered Cedric with the [[Killing Curse]], he died instantly and painlessly. Harry's and Voldemort's wands connected and Cedric's echo asked Harry to return his corpse to Amos. 



Harry managed to escape the graveyard and honoured Cedric's request, returning him to his devastated parents (Amos openly sobbed later while Harry explained what happened). Amos thanked Harry for returning Cedric's body, and assured him that they did not blame Harry for his death. Harry tried to give them the prize money that came with winning the tournament, but they refused it. It is possible that Amos and his wife attended the memorial feast held in Cedric's honour. 


Amos subsequently appeared to have little to do in the [[Second Wizarding War]] waged by the [[Order of the Phoenix]] against Lord Voldemort; his son was ultimately avenged when Voldemort was defeated.



 and [[Scorpius Malfoy]]]]
By [[2020]], Amos was living at [[St Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards]]. One of his carers was [[Delphini]], who affectionately called him uncle. One day, Amos heard about how [[Harry Potter]] may have found a [[time-turner]]. He decided to schedule a meeting with him. However, each meeting kept getting changed to a later date at the last minute. Several months later, Amos decided to visit Harry at his home in the middle of the night. Delphini helped Amos and he apprehended Harry when he returned home.

Amos begged Harry to use the time-turner to go back in time and save Cedric. Harry politely declined, stating he couldn’t meddle with time. Amos thought Harry was partly responsible for Cedric's death, because Voldemort never wanted Cedric. He was devastated to hear that Voldemort considered Cedric to be “the spare”. Harry lied to Amos and told him the story about a new time-turner was untrue. Amos thought Harry to be cold.

Unbeknownst to Amos, the conversation was overheard by [[Albus Potter]]. Albus decided to visit him and tell him that he and his friend [[Scorpius Malfoy]] would be happy to go back in time and save Cedric. Amos did not take them seriously at first considering they were only children, but he was convinced they could when Delphini persuaded him and made him see even children could change the future by reminding him of the great things that happened in the [[Second Wizarding War]].

The [[Plot to restore Lord Voldemort|plan]] to save Cedric inevitably changed the future, but not to the better one Amos had hoped for. It is unknown what happened to him in the changed timelines, but they were eventually undone. This left Amos without a son again. It is not known how he felt after this, but he still lamented about Cedric and would have no choice but to accept Cedric was gone.

Amos was later visited by Harry and [[Draco Malfoy]], who believed that he was responsible for their sons going missing again. They found out that Amos had sent them owls, which Amos denied and said he had no idea about their whereabouts. They told Amos that the children were last sighted with his niece Delphini, which surprised Amos, since he told them that he does not have a niece.


Amos was described as being "tall"; he had a ruddy face and a "scrubby" brown beard.




Amos was extremely proud of his son, Cedric, to the point of boasting about his accomplishments at every given opportunity. He became quite angry and disrespectful when Cedric was not even given a mention in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' story about the [[Triwizard Tournament]], whereas [[Harry Potter|Harry]] got a whole page to himself, though this was understandable, given that Cedric was meant to be the only [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] champion.



Amos was quite genial and friendly when walking through the woods with the Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione Granger. He was rather paternal, but came off as somewhat haughty and rude due to his loud voice and boastfulness of his son's accomplishments.

He was also quite emotional, roaring with joy when discussing Cedric winning a [[Quidditch]] game and roaring with anger at [[Winky]] the [[house-elf]] when interrogating her. He sobbed openly when he saw Cedric had died and when he was interviewed about his son's death, but at least didn't blame Harry for it, and contrary, believed Harry's claim of Voldemort's return and thanked him for returning Cedric's body.



By the time Amos was an old man, with him stating to be dying, he was still incredibly grief-stricken to even greater levels than before. He lamented deeply about his "beautiful" son and no longer respected or cared for the memorization of Cedric to the whole wizarding world as a man who died bravely, only wanting to see him at least one last time, and showed no hesitation in attempting to meddle with time to bring him back. He displayed a level of impatience but coupled with strong determination to the point after months of relentlessly sending owls to Harry turned out to be useless, he resolved firmly to go round to his house without caring Harry had just arrived home and was about to prepare his children for a new school year, showing he had became somewhat apathetic to the needs of others in his bitterness. 

Even though he once said he didn't think Harry was responsible for Cedric's death and thanked him for bringing Cedric's body back, he changed his mind by the time he found out about a new time-turner. He thought Harry to be partly responsible since Voldemort wanted to kill him really, not Cedric. Amos would angrily declare Harry to be a stone-cold Ministry man when he would not go back in time. He was also considered a "miserable old sod" by his carers at his home.




*'''[[Magizoology]]''': As a member of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], Amos Diggory had a high level of knowledge regarding [[magic]]al [[creature]]s. He knew how to [[Ministry of Magic Classification|classify]] them and the various laws regulating the ownership of such creatures, such as [[Ban on Experimental Breeding]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Amos could produce a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]], a mark of superior magical ability and talent given the immense difficulty of performing the charm. He could also successfully cast other charms, such as the [[Eradication Spell]], which he used to eradicate the [[Dark Mark]] in the sky after it was conjured after the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], along with both [[Stunning Spell]], and its [[Counter-charm]] the [[Reviving Spell]]. He could also perform the [[Reverse Spell]], which he used to reveal that the last spell cast with [[Harry Potter]]'s [[Harry Potter's wand|wand]] during the [[Reappearance of the Dark Mark]].





Amos and his [[Cedric Diggory's mother|wife]] appeared to be a happily married couple, but she could get displeased with his often arrogant and boastful behaviour. His wife comforted Amos after the death of Cedric, remarking that he must have been happy when he died.

[[Cedric Diggory]] was Amos's son. He was extremely proud of Cedric and his accomplishments, often boasting about them, making Cedric embarrassed, and was pleased by him being chosen to be in the Triwizard Tournament. Amos was devastated by his son's death and in 2020, asked Harry Potter to go back in time and bring him back, but then had to accept that Cedric was gone.




[[Arthur Weasley]] knew Amos from the Ministry of Magic. They were quite friendly, but could be at odds, especially during Winky's interrogation.

Amos's relationship with the other Weasleys is unknown, but almost had a public confrontation with [[Molly Weasley]] about Harry being in the Tournament.






[[Harry Potter]]'s relationship with Amos was rather mixed. Amos was amazed to first meet Harry Potter, but was also unintentionally rude to Harry, mostly when boasting about how [[Cedric]] beat him at Quidditch. Before the Third Task, Amos was not pleased about Cedric not being mentioned and Harry getting a whole page to himself. Despite this, Amos thanked Harry for bringing Cedric's body.


However, by [[2020]], Amos's increased grief made him blame Harry partially for Cedric's death and outright demanded Harry to bring him back through [[time]] travel and was angry and bitter when Harry refused to, declaring him a "stone-cold" Ministry man.





Amos's relationship with [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]] happened to be a rather strict one. When Amos thought Crouch's house-elf [[Winky]] had conjured the [[Dark Mark]], Crouch was offended by this and reprimanded Amos, especially since Crouch had proved and demonstrated throughout his long career that he detested and despised the [[Dark Arts]] and those who practise them.


Amos's relationship with [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] is mostly unknown, since they were only seen together after the conjuring of the Dark Mark. It is possible that their relationship was positive.


"Amos" is one of the twelve minor prophets of the ; it means "carried" in Hebrew.
