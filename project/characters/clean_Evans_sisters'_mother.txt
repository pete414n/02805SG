'''Mrs Evans''' (died between [[1 September]] [[1971]] and [[31 October]] [[1981]]) was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] woman and the mother of [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]]. Through Petunia, she was the maternal grandmother of [[Dudley Dursley]], and through Lily, the maternal grandmother of [[Harry Potter]] and great-grandmother of [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]] and [[James Potter II|James Sirius Potter]].


Mrs Evans and [[Evans sisters' father|her husband]] lived in [[Cokeworth]], [[England]]. The couple had two daughters: [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]], born in the late [[1950s]], and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]], born [[30 January]] [[1960]].

While Petunia was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] like her parents, Lily turned out to be a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], something that made Mr and Mrs Evans proud. Petunia, on the other hand, was jealous, considering her sister a "freak." According to Petunia, Mr and Mrs Evans favoured Lily, talking about her constantly.

On [[1 September]] [[1971]], Mrs Evans and her husband took Lily and Petunia to [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]], in order to see Lily off to her first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].


Mrs Evans and her husband died "normal Muggle death[s]" sometime before the murder of their daughter Lily and son-in-law [[James Potter I|James Potter]], on the night of [[31 October]], [[1981]].
Â and seeing his family for the first time]]

When Harry looked into the Mirror of Erised in [[1991]], he saw both his maternal and paternal grandparents, among a number of other relatives he had never met.
