'''Lucian Bole''' He was a [[Beater]] on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] in the [[1993–1994 school year]].


Lucian Bole started his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1988]], he was sorted into the house of [[Slytherin]] and became a member of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], playing the role of beater.

During the final match between [[Gryffindor]] and Slytherin in his sixth year, Bole clubbed Gryffindor [[Chaser]] [[Alicia Spinnet]], claiming he had mistaken her for a [[Bludger]]. In revenge, [[George Weasley]] elbowed Bole in the face, leading [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] to give both teams penalties.

In Bole's seventh year, the [[Triwizard Tournament]] lead all [[Quidditch]] games at Hogwarts to be cancelled, but he nonetheless nominally retained his position on the Slytherin team until his graduation in June 1995. He and fellow Slytherin Beater, [[Peregrine Derrick]], were replaced by [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] at the beginning of the next Quidditch season. [[Angelina Johnson]], the new captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], was glad to see Bole and Derrick gone, stating mockingly that she was always stunned the pair were able to find their way to Quidditch pitch without directions.


Lucian Bole, like many fellow members of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], was shown to possess poor sportsmanship and a preference for committing fouls against rival players.


*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Despite his unreasonable behaviour on the Quidditch pitch, Bole was nonetheless evidently an accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, as he played as [[Beater]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]].


*This character is known only by his surname in the [[Harry Potter books|''Harry Potter'' books]]. His first name is given as "Lucian" in the video game .
*It is possible that Bole is the [[Unidentified Slytherin Beater]] seen in , meaning he could have played in the [[1991–1992 school year]].
