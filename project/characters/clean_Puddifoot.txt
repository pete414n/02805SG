'''Madam Puddifoot''' (fl. 1980sâ€“2010) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who ran [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]] in [[Hogsmeade]].



In the [[1980s]], Puddifoot was introduced to [[Jacob's sibling]] by [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]].


On [[Valentine's day]] in [[1996]], Puddifoot decorated her shop by placing several golden [[cherub]]s around and had them throw confetti over visiting couples every so often. She served coffee to the couple [[Harry Potter]] and [[Cho Chang]].

By at least the [[2010s]], during the [[Calamity]], volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] met with Madam Puddifoot to try to convince her to join the SOS Task Force officially. She enthusiastically agreed and informed all staff to do whatever necessary to help support the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]'s efforts.


Puddifoot was a very stout woman with brown eyes and a shiny black bun.



Puddifoot was quite lonely, which was why she cluttered a lot of stuff in her shop to create a warm environment and help bring people together. She enjoyed serving her customers to ease her of loneliness.


*In , Madam Puddifoot is depicted with blonde hair rather than black. She is not playable under normal circumstances, but may be temporarily controlled with the [[Imperius Curse]] in the level "Dumbledore's Army" in order to collect the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] Crest for that level.
*It is possible she, alongside her fellow [[Hogsmeade]] residents, participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], as [[Horace Slughorn]] was recruiting them and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] declared a final stand for the entire [[Second Wizarding War]].
