'''Tobias Snape''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] and the patriarch of the [[Snape family]] in the late twentieth century. He was the husband of the [[Wizardkind|witch]] [[Eileen Prince|Eileen Snape]] (nèe [[Prince family|Prince]]) and the father of [[Severus Snape]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tobias was born sometime in the early [[20th century|twentieth century]], into the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Snape family]].

===Marriage===
He married the [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] [[Eileen Prince]]. He abused her mentally and emotionally, as [[Harry Potter]] saw in Severus Snape's memories during an Occlumency lesson. It could be surmised that he was physically abusive as well. Why they began a relationship and got married is currently unknown. Eileen may not have told him about the wizard world before their wedding.

It is possible that the marriage caused Eileen to be disowned by the Prince family, similar to [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda Tonks née Black]], who was disowned by her parents and sisters after she married [[Edward Tonks|a Muggle-born man]], and [[Merope Riddle|Merope Riddle née Gaunt]], who was disowned by her [[Marvolo Gaunt|father]] and  [[Morfin Gaunt|brother]] after she mentally enslaved [[Tom Riddle Senior|a Muggle squire]] into marrying her.

The couple lived at [[Spinner's End]], a working-class neighbourhood in [[Cokeworth]], [[England]].

On [[9 January]], [[1960]], Eileen gave birth to their son. [[Severus Snape|Severus]] noted during a conversation with his friend, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], that his parents fought often. They apparently neglected him during his childhood, or were poor, or both. His clothes were mismatched and did not fit properly. When he began his first year of school at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], he changed into his uniform quickly after getting onto the [[Hogwarts Express]], apparently glad to be rid of his Muggle clothes.

By [[September]] [[1981]], when Severus became the [[Potions (class)|Potions master]] and a [[Head of House]] at the school, Tobias and Eileen no longer resided in the house. As Severus was only twenty-one years old, it is likely that they were still alive but moved away, either together or separately.

==Personality and traits==
According to young Severus, Tobias was not fond of very much of anything, including magic. Even so, his son was a talented young wizard before even receiving [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|the Hogwarts letter]]. In 1995, [[Sirius Black]] mentioned that Severus knew more [[curse]]s when he arrived at school than many of the seventh-year students did. Tobias might not have tried to ban magic from the home, or Eileen and Severus might have used it whenever he was not around.

==Relationships==
===Family===
Tobias had a very poor relationship with both his wife and his son. When Severus was younger, Tobias frequently shouted at Eileen, and possibly hit her, whilst their son crouched in a corner, crying. The unhappy memories of the Snape home would haunt Severus into adulthood.

==Etymology==
''[[Wikipedia:Tobias|Tobias]]'' is the Greek form of the Hebrew name ''Tobiah'' from the biblical books of ''Ezra'' and ''Nehemiah'', meaning "God is good" - which is a big irony, given Tobias's nasty demeanour towards everything in life. In the apocryphal Book of Tobit in the Old Testament, Tobias is assisted by the archangel in driving a demon away from Sarah, who subsequently became his wife.

[[J. K. Rowling]] has stated that "Snape" is the name of a place in [[England]]. It also is an English verb meaning "''to be hard upon, rebuke or snub''", derived from the Old Norse "''sneypa''", meaning "''to outrage, dishonour, disgrace''". 

==Behind the scenes==
*His treatment towards [[Severus Snape|his son]] and [[Eileen Prince|wife]] caused the former to despise [[Muggles]] in general, given his contempt towards [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]]. He also may not have had stable employment.
