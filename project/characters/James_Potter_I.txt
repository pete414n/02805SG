{{Quote|Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off —|James protecting his family against Lord Voldemort|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
'''James Potter''' '''I''' ([[27 March]] [[1960]] - [[31 October]] [[1981]]),<ref name="DH16"/> also known as '''Prongs''', was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]]<ref name="blood" /><ref name="blood2" /> [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the only son of [[Fleamont Potter|Fleamont]] and [[Euphemia Potter]].<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref> He was also the grandson of [[Henry Potter]], whom he named his son after.<ref name="Pottermore2">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref> He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1971]] to [[1978]] and was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]].  

When James started at Hogwarts, he met and became best friends with three fellow Gryffindor students: [[Remus Lupin]], [[Sirius Black]], and [[Peter Pettigrew]]. He also met [[Severus Snape]], a [[Slytherin]] student with whom he became bitter rivals. During his seventh year, James was appointed [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] and began dating [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]]. 

After graduating from Hogwarts, he [[Wedding of James Potter I and Lily Evans|married]] Lily and together they had a son, [[Harry Potter|Harry James Potter]], of whom he made Sirius Black the godfather. James, Lily, and their friends all fought in the [[First Wizarding War]] as members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]; he and his wife defied [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] three times. However, James and Lily were forced to go into hiding after a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] was made concerning Voldemort and their infant son. James and Lily were ultimately betrayed to Voldemort by one of their close friends (Peter Pettigrew).  

As a result of this, James was tragically murdered by Voldemort on [[Hallowe'en]] in 1981. He and his wife died while trying to protect infant Harry. 

James briefly appeared again in May [[1998]] through the [[Resurrection Stone]]. He appeared through it along with Lily (his wife), Sirius Black and Remus Lupin (his friends). After the [[Second Wizarding War]], James posthumously had three grandchildren through his son: [[James Potter II|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]], the first of whom was named after his grandfather and his father's godfather (and friend of the former).

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1960–1971}}===
{{Quote|They had quite given up hope of a son or daughter when, to their shock and surprise, Euphemia found that she was pregnant and their beloved boy, James, was born.|James was born to Fleamont and Euphemia Potter|Pottermore}}
James Potter was born on [[27 March]] [[1960]] to [[Fleamont Potter]] and his wife [[Euphemia Potter|Euphemia]]. Fleamont was an accomplished, yet retired cosmetic [[potioneer]] and entrepreneur best known for inventing [[Sleekeazy's Hair Potion]] in [[1926]]. Both Fleamont and Euphemia were elderly even by [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] standards.<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref>

Having been conceived so late in his parents' lives, he was raised in a doting household with little material limits, and pampered a great deal. Hence, it was no surprise that he grew to be proud, arrogant, and boastful, but deep down still a good person.<ref name="JKR">[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript Leaky Cauldron: 30 July 2007 Webchat with J.K.

[[File:1971 sorting.jpg|250px|thumb|left|James after being Sorted into [[Gryffindor]], sitting next to Lily Evans]]
James started his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1971]] and was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] House. While there, he befriended fellow Gryffindors [[Sirius Black]], [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Peter Pettigrew]], and together they formed a small gang known only to themselves as the [[Marauders]]. Though more mischievous than diligent, James proved to be a clever student. 

At some point during his education, he became [[Chaser]] for [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|his House's Quidditch team]], in which he was completely aware of his talent. It is possible that he also collected [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s, as at an unknown time, the [[History of Magic]] [[professor|teacher]], Professor [[Cuthbert Binns]], gave him the [[Circe]] card, which later came into the possession of [[Quirinus Quirrell]], who kept it at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in [[Vault 998]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}} - GBC version</ref>

At some time at school, he and Sirius used an [[Illegal growth hex|illegal hex]] (perhaps ''[[Engorgio Skullus]]'') on [[Bertram Aubrey]] which caused his head to grow twice its original size. It is unknown what motivated the duo to hex him, though it rewarded them a double detention.<ref name="HBP24">{{HBP|B|24}}</ref>

[[File:Marauders.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Marauders in their Animagus forms]]
As second years, James, Sirius, and Peter figured out that Remus was a [[werewolf]], but rather than abandoning him (James, in particular, insisted this monthly hazard did not mean Remus was truly abnormal), they spent three years learning to become [[Animagus|Animagi]] in order to accompany Remus in his transformations. In his fifth year, James managed to perfect the transformation and become a [[Deer|stag]] Animagus, which earned him the nickname "Prongs". Using their new nicknames, the four friends created the [[Marauder's Map]], which displayed the [[Hogwarts Castle]] area and everyone within it —including all staff, ghosts and students — in their current location at a given time, and thus made sneaking out of the castle and avoiding teachers much easier.<ref name="POA18">{{POA|B|18}}</ref>

At some time during his school years, James took [[James Potter's photograph of Hogwarts|a photograph]] of [[Hogwarts Castle]] at sunset that he gave to Lupin.<ref name="HM24">{{HM|2|Packmates|4}}</ref>

For the vast majority of his time at school, James was somewhat an obnoxious youth with a love of showing off and exceptional self-confidence that bordered on arrogance. [[Severus Snape]] once said that he was so arrogant that "criticism simply bounced off him".<ref name="OOTP24">{{OOTP|B|24}}</ref> This rebellious attitude was notably shaped by the negative qualities he developed, such as the habit of ruffling his already messy hair to make it even untidier to look as though he had just alighted from his [[broomstick]]. Also [[hex]]ing innocent students for no other reason than because he could (especially Snape, a [[Slytherin]] in the same year as him). These qualities came about as a result of his pampered and spoiled upbringing. 

[[File:James Potter bothering Lily and Snape at Hogwarts.jpg|250px|thumb|left|James being obnoxious and trying to get Lily Evans's attention]]
James and Snape had a strong rivalry throughout their time at Hogwarts. To Remus and Sirius, the reason this rivalry began was due to Snape's jealousy over James's talent at [[Quidditch]] and his popularity, as well as Snape's interest in the [[Dark Arts]], which James despised. However, it was later revealed that James and Sirius had got off on the wrong foot with Snape from the beginning: when they first met Snape during their first year on the [[Hogwarts Express]], they insulted him (setting a solid foundation for rivalry), and their further interactions only served to make their rivalry intense and permanent — Snape followed the [[Marauders]] around, looking for reasons to get them expelled. James, in turn, used the hexes Snape himself had made up against him.<ref name="DH33">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>

At some point in their school years, Snape grew very interested in where Remus went every month, and saw [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] and Remus going to the [[Shrieking Shack]] using a secret passage under the [[Whomping Willow]]. Sirius had, as a joke, told him that the trick to getting past the Whomping Willow was to poke the knot at the bottom. Snape followed Sirius's directions, and was nearly at the Shrieking Shack when James pulled him back. At great risk to his own life, James saved Severus from certain death from Remus in werewolf form, but Snape adamantly refused to believe that his old rival would have done him a favour, believing that James had only saved him in order to avoid expulsion, and despised being in his debt.<ref name="POA14" /><ref name="POA18" />

[[File:James tormenting Severus flashback.gif|250px|thumb|The Marauders bullying Snape in their fifth year]]
James spent much of his academic career chasing after [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], an attractive [[Muggle-born]] fellow Gryffindor from Snape's hometown of [[Cokeworth]] who was secretly Snape's best friend and childhood crush since before they both started at Hogwarts. Lily was among those who were not so impressed of James, considering him arrogant and obnoxious. 

She once demanded James to quit jinxing Snape for fun. The former and his friends were in the middle of bullying Snape with a spell of Snape's own invention. Lily told him to stop and James responded with, "''I will if you'll go out with me, Evans''." When James took the [[Dangling Jinx|jinx]] off, Snape in his humiliation and anger, called Lily a "''filthy little [[Mudblood]]''". James demanded him to apologise, but Lily responded that James was as bad as Snape and she would not date him "''even if it were a choice between him and the [[Giant Squid]]''".<ref name="OOTP28">{{OOTP|B|28}}</ref> Snape's friendship with the vivacious and pretty Lily may have sparked envy in James and further fuelled the hateful enmity between the two.<ref name="JKR" />

[[File:Marauders OOTPF.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Marauders in their final years at Hogwarts]]
At the age of sixteen, James's parents allowed [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] to move in with them so he could escape his own horrible [[House of Black|family]], and Sirius soon became an unofficial member of their family. By the time he was at his seventh year, James had matured to the point that he lost the more mischievous aspects of his personality, and was even appointed [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] alongside Lily, despite the fact that he had not been a [[prefect]]. He stopped hexing bystanders for fun, though he still secretly hexed Snape, and in turn, Snape never lost an opportunity to hex him back, although it's implied that James was willing to stop for Lily's sake.<ref name="OOTP29">{{OOTP|B|29}}</ref> He also finally managed to impress Lily, and began dating her at this time.

In late [[1977]], Lily and James had a disastrous first meeting with Lily's sister [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia Evans]] and her then-fiancé, [[Vernon Dursley]], which presumably took place over [[Christmas]] break, as they were both still at Hogwarts. When Vernon tried to impress James with his car, the wizard in turn boasted of his own material wealth, and a row ensued. The evening ended with both Vernon and Petunia storming out of the restaurant and Lily bursting into tears, with James promising he'd apologise and make it up (which, due to his and Lily's untimely deaths, never happened). Petunia married by the end of that year. Though Lily and James were invited to the [[Wedding of Vernon Dursley and Petunia Evans|wedding]], Petunia refused to have Lily as a [[bridesmaid]], upsetting her deeply. At the reception, Vernon would not talk to James, but described him as "''some magician''" within his earshot.<ref name="dursleystory">{{WW|vernon-and-petunia-dursley}}</ref>

===First Wizarding War {{C|1978–1981}}===
{{Quote|I think you're like James, who would have regarded it as the height of dishonour to mistrust his friends.|Remus Lupin comparing [[Harry Potter]] to his father|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

====Marriage====
After graduation (at only eighteen years old) James married [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] and Sirius served as their best man at the wedding. It was a quiet ceremony because of the dangers of the [[First Wizarding War]]. Lily's older sister [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] did not attend, for she was highly against Lily being a witch and marrying a wizard. It is highly likely that [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Peter Pettigrew]] attended, as they were best friends of James. Both James's parents, [[Fleamont Potter|Fleamont]] and [[Euphemia Potter]] attended the wedding.<ref name="PotterFamily">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref> It's unknown as to whether either of Lily's parents attended as well.

====Order of the Phoenix====
[[File:The Marauders in Order of the Pheonix image.jpg|250px|thumb|James and his wife as members of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]James, Lily, and Sirius (along with [[Remus Lupin|Remus]] and [[Peter Pettigrew|Peter]]) joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]], in the fight against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. In around 1977<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=106 Waterstones Charity Auction] (archived via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine [https://web.archive.org/web/20080530144222/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=106 here]</ref>, he and Sirius were involved in a motorbike chase with two [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[police]]men. Although the chase started off as a bit of fun, it turned slightly more serious when the pair were attacked by three men on [[broomstick]]s. Sirius and James used their wands to raise the [[police car]] that had been chasing them, and their attackers crashed into it.<ref>[[Untitled charity auction story|Harry Potter Prequel]]</ref> 

During the course of the next three years, James and Lily defied the Dark Lord three times as the war continued. The first was when they refused to join Voldemort's side when he attempted to recruit them.<ref name="pottercast130">[http://web.archive.org/web/20090616145209/http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1217-pottercast-anelli.html J. K. Rowling interview on PotterCast #130]</ref>

At some point between [[1979]] and [[1980]], James's parents died of [[Dragon Pox]], and he inherited the vast Potter family fortune from them, which enabled him to comfortably support his family without the need for a paying job. James also used his wealth to support Remus, who was unemployable due to his status as a [[werewolf]].<ref>[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more J.K. Rowling comments at Carnegie Hall]</ref>

====Life in hiding====
{{Quote|The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against the wall, it made the banisters glow like lighting rods, and James Potter fell like a [[marionette]] whose strings were cut....|Lord Voldemort murdering James with the Killing Curse|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Potter family 2 - Harry as baby.gif|250px|thumb|left|James with Lily and their infant son]]
In the autumn of [[1979]], Lily became pregnant, which caused her and her husband to go into hiding.

On [[31 July]], [[1980]], Lily gave birth to their son, [[Harry Potter|Harry James Potter]], but it was not long before [[Albus Dumbledore]] found out that they were in the gravest of dangers: Harry had become a target of Lord Voldemort himself due to a [[prophecy]] concerning the one who could ultimately defeat him for good. Voldemort had learned of the prophecy through his follower, who was none other than a bitter old enemy of James as well as the former best friend of Lily: Snape.<ref name="OOTP37">{{OOTP|B|37}}</ref>

In [[1981]], Dumbledore told the Potters that their best chance of remaining safe against Voldemort was the [[Fidelius Charm]]. James insisted on using Sirius as their [[Secret Keeper|Secret-Keeper]], even though Dumbledore himself had offered to fill the position.<ref name="POA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref> However, Sirius had a different plan — he convinced James and Lily to use Peter Pettigrew as their Secret-Keeper instead, with him (Sirius) as a decoy. They agreed and Dumbledore cast the charm in secret, but this attempt at a double-bluff ended in tragedy. The only people to know about the switch were James, Lily, Sirius, and Peter. Even Dumbledore and Remus were kept in the dark. Less than a week later, Peter betrayed the Potters to Voldemort.<ref name="Fidelius">{{POA|B|10}} - "“He did,” said Fudge heavily. “And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed - “Black betrayed them?” breathed Madam Rosmerta. "He did indeed."</ref>

=====Death=====
{{Main|Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)}}

[[File:James Potter's dead body.png|250px|thumb|A deceased James after being murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]]]
When the Dark Lord arrived at [[Godric's Hollow]] on [[Hallowe'en]] in [[1981]], James told Lily to take Harry and run. After his wife and son were out of the room, he stood to face the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time on his own, in order to give his wife and child time to escape the cottage. However, James had made a fatal mistake; he had left [[James Potter I's wand|his wand]] in the living room, where he had been entertaining his young son with it before Voldemort's arrival. Voldemort effortlessly murdered him with the [[Killing Curse]] — James "''fell like a [[marionette]] whose strings were cut''".<ref name="DH17">{{DH|B|17}}</ref> 

Voldemort then proceeded upstairs to where Lily and the infant Harry were hiding. Voldemort murdered Lily, who died protecting Harry, but thanks to her [[Sacrificial protection|loving sacrifice]], the Killing Curse Voldemort cast at Harry rebounded and destroyed the Dark Lord's body leaving Harry with only a [[Harry Potter's scars#The lightning-bolt scar|lightning-bolt scar]]. Thus, Harry became known as ''"the Boy Who Lived"'' and whose name would be famous.<ref name="PS1">{{PS|B|1}}</ref>

===Post-mortem {{C|1991–2017}}===
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|You'll stay with me?|James|Until the very end.|Harry speaking to his parents through the [[Resurrection Stone]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
After James and Lily's deaths, their son was raised by Lily's unloving sister, [[Petunia Dursley]], and her grumpy husband, [[Vernon Dursley|Vernon]], along with their gluttonous son, [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]. Despite not remembering his parents, Harry held them in high esteem. This faltered slightly where his father was concerned. He learned that James had been something of a bully in his youth, witnessing a memory of Snape's, in which James and Sirius picked on and humiliated Snape simply because they were bored.<ref name="OOTP28" /> 

Snape, who switched sides after Lily's death and became [[Potions (class)|Potions]] professor at Hogwarts, treated Harry with disdain throughout his academic career, perceiving him to be "''arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker... attention-seeking and impertinent''".<ref name="DH33">{{DH|B|33}}</ref> In revenge he frequently bullied and humiliated Harry.

====Harry's memories of his parents====
[[File:74.JPG|250px|thumb|left|James and Lily as seen by Harry in the [[Mirror of Erised]]]]
In an attempt to stay hidden from [[Argus Filch]], the school [[Hogwarts Caretaker|caretaker]], Harry stumbled upon the classroom where the mirror was being stored. Upon looking into it, Harry saw his late parents, Lily and James Potter.<ref name="PS12">{{PS|B|12}}</ref> Over the next few days, Harry proceeded to visit it as often as he could to see [[James and Lily Potter|his parents]]' faces. The Mirror also occupied his thoughts beyond anything else, to the extent that he disregarded Ron's warning that he was growing obsessed with it. 

Harry only stopped visiting the mirror after Dumbledore found him one night. Dumbledore found Harry and explained what the mirror was all about. Dumbledore told him that the mirror was to be moved and requested that Harry not go looking for it. 1992 was the last time Harry saw his parents faces in the mirror. Later, at the end of Harry's [[1991–1992 school year|first year]], [[Rubeus Hagrid]] gave Harry a special [[Harry Potter's photo album|photo album]] containing pictures of his parents.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

====Dementor attacks====
In his third year, whenever Harry encountered a [[Dementor]], he was forced to relive his parents' deaths. The death he was particularly forced to relive was Lily's.<ref name="POA5">{{POA|B|5}}</ref><ref name="POA20">{{POA|B|20}}</ref> This could be due to Harry being in the same room as Lily when she died, while James was murdered in the hallway. Therefore, Harry did not witness nor hear James's death.

====Little Hangleton====
{{Quote|The smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as Bertha had done, straightened up, and looked at him... and Harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his father.|James Potter's echo emerging as a result of ''Priori Incantatem''|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Priori Incantatem Pottermore.png|250px|thumb|The echoes of James and Lily Potter after being awakened by ''[[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]]'']]
In Harry's fourth year, Wormtail had placed Voldemort's rudimentary body into a [[cauldron]] containing the nearly finished [[potion]]. He added the first two ingredients: his hand and Harry's blood, as Voldemort believed it would make him stronger and make his enemy touchable. This was because he indirectly received Lily's [[sacrificial protection]]. However, this action also bound Harry's life to Voldemort [[Horcrux|again]] but inversely: Harry couldn't die as long as Voldemort still lived, which ironically meant he couldn't kill the boy.<ref name="GOF33">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref>

On [[24 June]] [[1995]], during Harry's [[Duel in Little Hangleton|duel]] with [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] in the [[Little Hangleton]] graveyard, they experienced [[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]]. Shades of his mother and father, and others whom Voldemort had murdered came out of [[Tom Riddle's wand|Voldemort's wand]], encouraging Harry and distracting Voldemort so the younger wizard could escape from the graveyard.<ref name="GOF342">{{GOF|B|34}}</ref>

====Occlumency====
In [[1996]], Harry also witnessed a memory of James viciously humiliating Snape back when they were Hogwarts students. James had suspended Snape in the air and went as far as taking Snape's trousers off in front of a large crowd of students. Harry was disgusted by James's attitude, despite his own hatred of Snape.<ref name="OOTP28">{{OOTP|B|28}}</ref>

====Resurrection Stone====
[[File:Harry-potter7-james harry.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry temporarily bringing back his family and friends with the Resurrection Stone]]
In [[1998]], Harry learned he was a [[Horcrux]] of Voldemort's, and walked toward his death in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. Upon entering, he used the Resurrection Stone to summon James and others who had perished in the war against Voldemort. James and Lily told Harry that they were tremendously proud of him, proud of his outstanding courage and strength, and assured him that they would stay with him until the very end. Harry described their very presence as his courage, the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other, with Lily smiling at him, and James nodding in encouragement.<ref name="DH34">{{DH|B|34}}</ref>

Harry eventually named his [[James Potter II|eldest child]] after his late father. James would gain two more grandchildren: [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]].<ref name="DHE">{{DH|B|E}}</ref>

==Physical description==
[[File:Best Main James Potter.jpg|200px|thumb|right|James before his death]]
James was a tall, thin man with hazel eyes and untidy black hair that stuck up at the back.<ref name="eyes" /><ref name="hair2" /> During his [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] years, he had an indefinable air of having been well cared for and even adored. As late as his fifth year, he started wearing glasses, though he had not in his first year.<ref name="OOTP28" />

His son, [[Harry Potter|Harry]], was constantly noted to look very much like him, having the same untidy hair, thin face, mouth, eyebrows, and even hands. However, as observed by Harry in Snape's worst memory, James's nose was slightly longer than his son's.<ref name="OOTP28" />

In his Animagus form, James was a tall and powerful red stag, large enough to subdue an adolescent werewolf alongside Sirius's bear-like black dog form.<ref name="POA18" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b|Severus Snape|He fancies you, James Potter fancies you! And he's not... everyone thinks... big Quidditch hero —|Lily Evans|I know James Potter's an arrogant toerag. I don't need you to tell me that.|Snape and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]] discussing James in their fifth year|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
James was a clever and talented wizard, but very mischievous in his youth. He was arrogant and boastful. He occasionally bullied and jinxed other students just for fun, particularly his long-time rival, [[Severus Snape]].<ref name="OOTP28" /> However, even in this stage of arrogance, he still displayed some positive qualities of character. Despite being a [[pure-blood]], he strongly disagreed with the concept of [[Blood status|blood purity]]. He was disgusted with any prejudice towards [[Muggle-born]]s and did not hold prejudice towards [[Werewolf|werewolves]] (such as [[Remus Lupin]], who was one of his dearest friends). 

This loyalty he felt towards Lupin would extend to his adulthood. Demonstrated, when he used his wealth to support the unemployable Remus. Additionally, even despite his bad relationship with Snape, James never wanted him dead and even risked his life to prevent Snape from being killed by Lupin in his wolf form, showing he may humiliate but even at his worst he would never stoop to the level of murder by inaction.<ref name="POA18" /> Snape would later point out that James was lazy.<ref name="OTPF">{{OOTP|F}}</ref>

{{Dialogue a-b-c-b-a|James Potter|How'd the exam go, Snivelly?|Sirius Black|I was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment. There'll be great grease marks all over it, they won't be able to read a word.|Severus Snape|You — wait. You — wait....|Wait for what? What're you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?|Wash out your mouth. [[Scouring Charm|Scourgify]]!|James and Sirius tormenting Snape in their fifth year|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}James ultimately matured and changed his ways; he lost some of his arrogance and stopped using his magic irresponsibly on others. He became enough of a responsible student and leader to be [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] in his final year, and later a member of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Though he never completely lost his rebellious side, it was clear James had left Hogwarts a far better person than he had been upon entering it.

His best quality was his willingness to sacrifice himself for his wife and son, as demonstrated when he told Lily to take Harry and run while he held off [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], proving himself to be a true [[Gryffindor]].<ref name="DH17" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
[[File:Patronus_PM_SilverStagPatronus_MomentIllust.jpg|276x276px|thumb|James's stag [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] and Animagus form]]
{{Quote|It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong —|James and Sirius's talent for transfiguration|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
Since James was once asked by Voldemort to join his [[Death Eaters]], this was clear proof that James was a highly powerful and accomplished wizard. Remus once stated that James had been one of the cleverest Hogwarts students of his time.<ref name="POA18" /> He was able to conjure a corporeal stag [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name="Patronus" /> a mark of superior magical ability.<ref name="Patronus Charm">{{WW|patronus-charm}}</ref>
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': James's wand was said to be ''"excellent for Transfiguration"'',<ref name="PS5" /> with his own skills showing his exceptional proficiency in this notably very difficult, [[Science|scientific]] and even dangerous branch of [[magic]]. He was so skilled in [[Human Transfiguration]], that he learned how to become an Animagus at the age of fifteen.<ref name="POA18" /> He also very likely succeeded in this [[Transfiguration (class)|subject]] whilst as a Hogwarts student.
*'''[[Potion]]s''': James was exceptionally proficient in potion-making. At the age of fifteen, he successfully brewed an effective [[Animagus potion]]. This testified to his remarkable talent in the subject, as the Animagus potion was known to be highly complex, difficult to brew, and had great consequences if done incorrectly.<ref name="PP">{{PP}}</ref> Remus also described the Animagus transformation was a very difficult branch of magic that "''could go horribly wrong''". The fact that James not only succeeded at it<ref name="POA18" /> (but also helped Peter to manage it as well) is concrete evidence of his being an skilled potioneer. It is possible that his exceptional talent in potions at such a young age stemmed from his extensive lineage. He was descended from great potioneers such as [[Linfred of Stinchcombe]], his earliest ancestor and creator of an early version of the [[Pepperup Potion]]. He was also descended from [[Fleamont Potter]], creator of [[Sleekeazy's Hair Potion]] (or simply Sleekeazy), which quadrupled the [[Potter family|family]] fortune.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': James was highly talented in charm-work from a young age - he and his fellow Marauders managed to create the magically-complex [[Marauder's Map]] during their teenage years, with the [[Homonculous Charm]],<ref name="POA18" /> along with a [[Charm to insult Severus Snape]].<ref name="POA14" /> He was also able to cast the highly advanced [[Patronus Charm]], conjuring a corporeal Patronus whose form was identical with his Animagus form, a stag.<ref name="Patronus" /> He could also cast simpler charms proficiently, such as the [[Disarming Charm]] and [[Scouring Charm]], which he once used to bully Snape in his fifth year.<ref name="OOTP28" />
*'''[[Duelling]]''': James was a highly skilful duellist. During his student years, he was able to humiliate Severus Snape, who was already a skilled wizard in his youth, albeit with help from Sirius Black. He could cast several offensive spells competently, such as the [[Disarming Charm]], [[Impediment Jinx]], ''[[Dangling Jinx|Levicorpus]]'' (along with its [[counter-jinx]] ''[[Liberacorpus]]'') and other [[hex]]es, which he often used to bully Snape.<ref name="OOTP28" /> During the First Wizarding War he presumably took part in battles against the Death Eaters and other dark forces, surviving until the end of the war. He and his wife, Lily, also defied Voldemort himself three times, which showcased his exceptional talent in [[martial magic]].<ref name="DH33" /> 
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO SEEKER. JK Rowling herself stated that James was a Chaser. -->
{{Quote|You fly as well as your father did, Harry...|Sirius Black regarding James and Harry's talent for flying|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': James was an accomplished [[Quidditch]] player, playing [[Chaser]] for the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his school years.<ref name="Chaser" /> He was noted to have excellent reflexes, as seen when playing with a Snitch he had taken from the Quidditch supplies. Sirius also stated that Harry's Quidditch and flying skills were as good as those of James'.<ref name="POA17">{{POA|B|17}}</ref>

==Possessions==
{{Quote|Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.|Description of the Potter fortune|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:JamesPotterWand NN8206.jpg|132x132px|thumb|James Potter's wand]] 
*'''[[James Potter I's wand|Wand]]''': James's wand was 11 inches long, [[mahogany]], and had an unknown core. The wand was described as ''"pliable"'', slightly more powerful than Lily's wand, and "''excellent for [[Transfiguration]]''", which would later come in handy.<ref name="PS5" />
*'''[[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]]''': James owned the invisibility cloak (actually one of the fabled [[Deathly Hallows]]) that he and his friends often used during their days at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to assist them in their mischief. [[Albus Dumbledore]] had the cloak prior to James's death and later passed it down to [[Harry Potter|Harry]].<ref name="PS12" /><ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>
[[File:MaraudersMapHBP.png|221x221px|thumb|The Marauder's Map]]
*'''[[Marauder's Map]]''': The map was created by the [[Marauders]] between [[1975]] and [[1978]].<ref name="POA18" /> It is a magical document that reveals all of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Not only does it show every classroom, every hallway, and every corner of the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]], but it also shows every inch of the grounds, as well as all the [[Hogwarts secret passages|secret passages]] that are hidden within its walls and the location of every person in the grounds, portrayed by a dot.<ref name="POA10" /> However, the [[Room of Requirement]] is not visible on the map, being the only known area of the castle not to be seen on the Map, other than the [[Chamber of Secrets]].
*'''[[Two-way mirror]]''': James owned this mirror during his school years; he and [[Sirius Black]] used a pair of two-way mirrors so they could talk to each other while they were in separate detentions. Sirius later gave James's mirror to Harry in [[1996]].<ref name="OOTP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>
*'''[[Potter family|Potter]] inheritance''': When James's parents died, they left him a small fortune that he would later pass on to his son, Harry.<ref name="PS5" />
*'''[[Potter cottage]]''': James owned cottage in [[Godric's Hollow]] along with his wife [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]], during the final weeks of the [[First Wizarding War]]. This is where he and his wife were murdered and his son Harry was marked as the ''"Boy Who Lived"''. The cottage still stands as a reminder of what happened that [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|Hallowe'en night]] in [[1981]].<ref name="DH16" />
*'''[[Potters' cat|Cat]]''': This was a pet of the Potter family. What happened to it after the attack is unknown.<ref name="DH10">{{DH|B|10}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Family===
====Parents====
James was born into a very wealthy pure-blood family. He had an excellent relationship with his parents, who loved him very much. His father was Sorted in [[Gryffindor]] and used to tell him about how the house prized bravery and boldness above all other qualities. James's parents were on the older side when he was born and died before he was murdered in [[1981]].<ref name="JKR" />

====Lily Evans====
{{Quote|Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you've just got off your [[broomstick]], showing off with that stupid [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]], walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can — I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. You make me ''SICK''.|Lily's negative opinion of James's character|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Lily Potter1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], his wife and mother of his son]]
James's relationship with Lily Evans was initially a rocky one. While James was a popular student and talented [[Quidditch]] player, well-liked by most, Lily was unimpressed with him. This had to do with James's hostile relationship with her best friend, [[Severus Snape]] and because of James's bad habit of [[hex]]ing innocent students just for the fun of it.<ref name="OOTP28" />

James had developed romantic feelings for Lily by his fifth year. He was always going out of his way to try to impress her, only to end up making a fool out of himself most of the time. She still regarded him as an arrogant bully, treating him with absolute disdain.<ref name="OOTP28" /> In their seventh year, however, Lily was finally willing to go out with James, after he smoothed out and stopped hexing people for the fun of it (though she was unaware he still hexed Snape).

The two were [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] and [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Girl]] at Hogwarts and married soon after graduation. James and Lily were both members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], and together defied [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] himself three times. Their son, Harry James Potter, was born on [[31 July]], [[1980]].

====Harry Potter====
{{Quote|When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments... but we will give you time... you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts... do you understand, Harry?|James Potter's echo to his son Harry in the Little Hangleton graveyard|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Potter family moving photograph.gif|250px|thumb|James with his infant son Harry]]
Harry was born to James and Lily Potter on [[31 July]], [[1980]], they loved their son more than anything. On [[Hallowe'en]] night in 1981 they sacrificed themselves at 21 years old, in order to save him from [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], when he was just an infant.<ref name="DH17" /><ref name="DH33" /> [[Albus Dumbledore]] always maintained that Harry's love for his parents and the love they had in return for him, was his greatest power.<ref name="HBP23">{{HBP|B|23}}</ref>

Harry regarded his parents with great reverence, and fiercely defended their memories. In 1995, he [[Muggle duelling|punched]] [[Draco Malfoy]] for insulting his mother,<ref name="OOTP19">{{OOTP|B|19}}</ref> and he frequently became furious with [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], who taunted Harry that James was not the great man others made him out to be.<ref name="POA14">{{POA|B|14}}</ref> Much to Harry's horror, Snape was proven right in the spring of 1996, when Harry accidentally witnessed James bullying Snape in one of his memories during Harry's [[Occlumency]] lessons (via [[Hogwarts Pensieve|Albus Dumbledore's Pensieve]]).<ref name="OOTP28" /> However, [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Sirius Black]] assured him that his father was no longer the bully that he once was. He matured and changed his ways, or he would never have become [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] and his mother would have never agreed to go out with him, let alone fall in [[love]] and marry him.

{{Dialogue a-b|Lily Potter|You've been so brave.|James Potter|You are nearly there. Very close. We are... ''so'' proud of you.|Harry's parents speaking to him through the [[Resurrection Stone]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Harry Potter movies hbp promostills 6.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], his son and only child|left]]
The few times Harry ever saw his parents were through pictures given to him by [[Rubeus Hagrid]], a vision within the [[Mirror of Erised]], spectral forms which came out of Voldemort's wand during [[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]], stored memories within the Pensieve, and again as spectral forms when he "recalled" them during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], by using the Resurrection Stone. His spirit was described as "''exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like [[Arthur Weasley|Mr Weasley]]'s, a loving smile on his face''". Both James and Lily told their son that they were tremendously proud of him, for being so brave and strong despite all the pain and suffering he had to endure, and provided him with the support he needed to sacrifice himself to Voldemort. Harry later avenged his father when he killed Voldemort at the end of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

It's also seen that James calls Harry by a name of affection, he has on different occasions referred to him as "''son''". Harry eventually named two of his children after his late parents and godfather, [[James Potter II|James Sirius]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]].

====Vernon Dursley====
James's first meeting with his brother-in-law [[Vernon Dursley]] went badly. Vernon asked James what car he drove, but James described his racing [[Broomstick|broom]], thus Vernon started patronising him and finally offended James by supposing out loud that [[Wizardkind|wizards]] had to live on unemployment benefit. Having heard from the wizard that he had a fortune in solid gold, he grew angry and stormed out of the restaurant, where they had met with their wives. After that Vernon refused to talk with James, but described him, within James's earshot, as "''some kind of amateur [[magician]]''".<ref name="dursleystory" />

After Lily and James's deaths, Vernon and Petunia reluctantly adopted Harry due to the [[sacrificial protection]] that shielded Harry from Voldemort. However, the Dursleys spent the following ten years doing everything in their power to prevent Harry from learning about his magical heritage and abilities, such as lying about how Lily and James died by attributing their deaths to a car crash.<ref name="PS4" />

===Marauders===
{{Dialogue a-b-c|Peter Pettigrew|Harry! You — thank you — it's more than I deserve — thank you —|Harry Potter|Get off me. I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it because — I don't reckon my dad would've wanted them to become killers — just for you.|Sirius Black|You're the only person who has the right to decide, Harry. But think... think what he did...|Sirius and [[Harry Potter|Harry]] after the latter stopped him and Remus from killing Pettigrew|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Marauders 1997.jpg|250px|thumb|The [[Marauders]], his best friends]]
While at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], James became the very best of friends with [[Sirius Black]], [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Peter Pettigrew]], and the group called themselves "the Marauders". He met Sirius on the [[Hogwarts Express]] in their first year, and they seemed to bond quickly. In their second year, when the group discovered that Remus was a [[werewolf]], they refused to ostracise him, as most would, instead learning to become [[Animagus|Animagi]] in order to keep him company during his transformations.<ref name="POA18" /> James insisted that Remus was not abnormal because of his condition, and later used his wealth to support Remus when [[anti-werewolf legislation]] made it difficult for him to get a job.

The four friends enjoyed untold popularity while at school and particularly liked playing pranks together; they also invented the [[Marauder's Map]] and all joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]], after graduating from Hogwarts. Although he was very close to all of his friends, James was probably closest to Sirius, whom he loved as a brother and who moved in with James and his parents after running away from [[12 Grimmauld Place|home]] at age sixteen. James also chose Sirius as his best man at [[Wedding of James Potter I and Lily Evans|his wedding to Lily]], as well as his son's godfather. When the [[Potter family|Potters]] became [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s targets in [[1981]], James was adamant about Sirius being their [[Secret Keeper|Secret-Keeper]], though he agreed to Sirius's plan to make Peter the Secret-Keeper instead, to throw off the enemy. 

James's unshakeable trust in his friends would be his undoing, as Pettigrew betrayed him, his wife, and his son to Voldemort. This betrayal was something Sirius and Remus later attempted to kill him for. The only thing that stopped them was Harry, who thought that his father would not want his best friends to become killers just for a traitor. Dumbledore later assured Harry that his belief had been right, saying that he knew James very well, both at Hogwarts and later and he was perfectly sure that James would have saved Pettigrew as well.

The ending to the three Marauders who had stayed true to their friendship to the very end — James, Sirius, and Remus — was bittersweet: though they all lost their lives to the two wizarding wars, they died as heroes of the Order of the Phoenix, and in the case of James and Lupin, devoted fathers who had tried to give their sons a better world to live in. The three were likely reunited forever in the afterlife.  

===Severus Snape===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Severus Snape|How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers... The resemblance between you is uncanny.|Harry Potter|My dad didn't strut. And neither do I.|Your father didn't set much store by rules either. Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen —|Severus Snape negatively comparing Harry to his father James|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Severus Snape.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Severus Snape]], his hated rival]]
James met Severus Snape on the [[Hogwarts Express]] in their first year at Hogwarts, and the two immediately got off on the wrong foot. James scoffed at Snape's desire that he and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] would be [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] house, while Snape sneered at James's hope that he would follow his father's footsteps and end up in [[Gryffindor]]. He and Sirius bestowed the mocking nickname of "''Snivellus''" on Snape at this first meeting.<ref name="DH33" /> This enmity would continue for the rest of their school years and (on Snape's part) well after James's death. According to Sirius, Snape envied James's popularity and [[Quidditch]] talents, and always tried to get him and his friends in trouble, while James despised Snape's fascination with the [[Dark Arts]]. James also frequently bullied Severus Snape during his fifth year, the memories of which could be viewed in Snape's [[Pensieve]].<ref name="OOTP28" />

{{Dialogue a-b-a|James Potter|Apologise to Evans!|Lily Evans|I don't want you to make him apologise. You're as bad as he is....|What? I'd NEVER call you a — you-know-what!|James and Lily arguing over Snape, after Snape called Lily a [[Mudblood]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Later, it is revealed that James and Snape would regularly pass snide remarks and taunts towards each other. Although James disliked and bullied Snape, in the end, James never wanted Snape dead despite his distaste of him and risked his life to save Snape's when Sirius played a potentially lethal prank on him by sending him to the [[Shrieking Shack]] when [[Remus Lupin]] was there transforming. However, Snape despised being in James's debt and felt, even twenty years later, that James only saved him to avoid expulsion.<ref name="POA18" />

Most of his dislike of James's son Harry was motivated by seeing his old rival in Harry, as well as a constant reminder that Lily had loved another man. Snape was also involved in James's death: Snape was the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who relayed [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|the Prophecy]] that foretold the birth of the one who would defeat Snape's then-master [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].<ref name="OOTP37" /> When Voldemort was informed of this, he chose to get rid of James, his wife, and their son. Snape intervened by pleading for Lily's life, while ignoring the danger into which his actions put James and Harry.<ref name="DH33" />

{{Quote|James always suspected Snape harboured deeper feelings for Lily, which was a factor in James's behaviour towards Snape.|[[J. K. Rowling]] on why James particularly hated Snape|Accio Quote!}}
After Lily and James were killed, Snape reluctantly agreed to help Dumbledore protect Harry from Voldemort. However, Snape never forgot James's bullying or earlier arrogance, and constantly projected many of James's flaws unto Harry during their interactions as teacher and student. This was one of many factors that led to Harry hating Snape during this period, until Harry witnessed many of Snape's repressed memories and gained a better understanding of Snape's loyalties.<ref name="DH33" />

Ironically, despite their mutual antipathy, James's [[Albus Potter|second grandson]] was named after Snape years after both of their deaths.<ref name="DHE" />

===Albus Dumbledore===
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his former headmaster]]
James always had a good relationship with Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore was the Headmaster of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] at the time James attended the school. He became fond of James knowing that, despite his being an arrogant, highly mischievous trouble-maker, he was also a kind-hearted, good-natured person. James became a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation founded by Dumbledore, during the [[First Wizarding War]] and fought in several battles with him. Dumbledore also attempted to protect James, Lily, and Harry from Voldemort, who was out to kill their son by offering to be their Secret Keeper. However, the role of Secret Keeper went instead to [[Peter Pettigrew]], which turned out to be a fatal mistake, as Peter was, unbeknownst to them, a spy for Voldemort. When James and Lily were murdered by Voldemort, Dumbledore was devastated. After death, Dumbledore was amused and impressed that James, Sirius and Peter became Animagi without his knowledge. 

Albus later became a mentor to James's [[Harry Potter|son]], and they shared an intimate relationship, more like a grandfather and his grandson, rather than a headmaster and his pupil. Dumbledore often sympathised with Harry about the grief and loneliness caused by his parents's death, and would comfort him at times when he really needed it. He also firmly believed and emphasised many times that Harry's love for his parents, James and Lily, was the reason why he had a power stronger than Voldemort's.

Years after James and Dumbledore's deaths, the former's [[Albus Potter|second grandson]] was named after the latter.<ref name="DHE" />

===Minerva McGonagall===
{{Quote|Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it... Oh, Albus...|Minerva's sadness after being informed of James and Lily's deaths|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Mcgonagall.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Minerva McGonagall]], his former head of house and teacher]]
Minerva McGonagall was the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] Professor and also the [[Head of Gryffindor House]], at the time James was a student. McGonagall was simultaneously fond of, and exasperated with James: she knew that he was a mischievous trouble-maker and often played cruel pranks on some of his school rivals (such as [[Severus Snape]]), but she also knew that he was a clever and talented wizard, and essentially a good person; overall, they had a good relationship, which presumably improved significantly after James cleaned up his act, and became worthy of being made [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]].<ref name="POA10" />

Upon learning of James and Lily's deaths a few hours after they were murdered, McGonagall was devastated, and barely managed to keep her composure.<ref name="PS1" /> In her later years, she shared quite a close relationship with James's son, [[Harry Potter|Harry]].

===Order of the Phoenix===
[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250px|thumb|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]
James did have a good relationship with most of the members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], during the First Wizarding War. He might have been friendly with some members, such as [[Elphias Doge]] and [[Alastor Moody]], as they were all members during the first war and most likely fought in several battles together. It is possible that James had many other friendships during his time in the Order, but they were unknown; his most famous friendship being the one he shared with the Marauders. Most of the original members of the Order were killed during the [[Second Wizarding War]]; only a few of them managed to survive.

*James is played by [[Adrian Rawlins]] in the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' and reprised the role for ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. In the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]],'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', footage from earlier films was used. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', James was played as a teenager by [[Robbie Jarvis]] and as a child by [[Alfie McIlwain]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]'' in flashback scenes.<ref name="twitter">[http://twitter.com/#!/benedictclarke/status/107892013030055936/ Twitter]</ref> This means the only film adaption which James doesn't appear in is ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. By an interesting coincidence, Rawlins was also born on [[27 March]].
*[[Tom Milligan]] portrays James in the [[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (play)|original West End production]] of {{CC}}.
*In {{PS|FA}}, James was said to have been a [[Seeker]]. However, [[J. K. Rowling]] has stated that James was a Chaser.<ref name="Chaser" />
*To date, the ''[[Untitled charity auction story|Harry Potter Prequel]]'' is the only story to feature James while he was alive. All other appearances have either been as an echo or as a flashback.
*In the last film, in Snape's memory, it shows that James was killed at the top of the staircase instead of in the living room.
*When [[Harry Potter]] speaks with [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] in the room of the Mirror of Erised in {{PS}}, Voldemort says that James "put up a good fight" before he killed him; this is inconsistent with James later being revealed not to have had his wand at the time. It's possible, however, that Voldemort was exaggerating, as James ''did'' try to hold him off, but was killed quickly, being that his wand was not on him at the time.
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, James is depicted as having brown instead of black hair. His son's hair colour was also changed.
*In the movie adaptations, James appears to be much older than he was intended to be, being only twenty-one-years old when he died.
*There has been some speculation that James's parents were [[Charlus Potter]] and [[Dorea Black]], who appear on the [[House of Black|Black family tree]] and are said to have had one [[Charlus Potter's son|son]]. However, with the new information revealed on {{PM}}, this was stated to not be the case, with James's parents named as Fleamont and Euphemia Potter.<ref>[[House of Black|Black family tree]]</ref> However, it is more than likely that Charlus and Dorea were related to James, being possibly his uncle and aunt or a sort of cousins on his father's side.
*In {{DH|F2}}, James was shown to be without glasses during his earliest Hogwarts years. However, a possible explanation would that [[Fleamont Potter|his father]] did not wear glasses, and his eyesight gradually required them.
*Rawlins reprised James's role for the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (video game)|video game adaption of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'']].
*James was the only member of the Marauders not to live to the 1990s.
*If James had lived, he would have been in his thirties during the Harry Potter story-line.
*Ironically, James's actor Adrian Rawlins shares the same first and last initials as [[Alan Rickman]] - the actor who played James's hated rival Severus Snape.
*James and his wife are one of two pairs of relatives killed by Voldemort. The second is that composed by [[Gellert Grindelwald]] and [[Bathilda Bagshot]]. However, unlike the latter, they were killed on the same day.
*James and Draco are very similar in many ways.
**Both were only children born to rich, pure-blood families.
**Both had very loyal friend groups.
**Both well-known for being bullies, and did it to one specific person (Snape for James, and Harry for Draco).
**During their final years at Hogwarts, the wars against Voldemort were worsening and reaching their climaxes.
**Both drastically changed during their final year at Hogwarts.
**Both married somebody that made them a better person.
