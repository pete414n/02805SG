'''Piers Polkiss''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] and [[Dudley Dursley]]'s best friend, when they were young.<ref name="PS2"/> Despite being scrawny with a face like a [[rat]], he was a member of [[Dudley Dursley]]'s [[Dudley Dursley's gang|gang]] and was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs so Dudley could hit them. Piers did not like [[Harry Potter]], because Dudley did not, and he always followed Dudley's lead.<ref name="PS2"/> Piers would also join Dudley at [[Smeltings Academy]].<ref name="PS3">{{PS|B|3}}</ref>

==Biography==
===[[1991]]===
{{Quote|Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?|Piers' shock after witnessing Harry Potter talk to a [[snake]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Chasse à Harry.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]], Piers Polkiss and [[Dudley Dursley]]]]
On [[23 June]] [[1991]], Dudley's eleventh birthday, Piers accompanied him, the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] and Harry to the [[zoo]]. During the trip, Piers saw Harry [[Parseltongue|talking]] to a [[Boa constrictor at the zoo|snake]] in the reptile house. When Harry was pushed out of the way, and then [[Underage magic|unintentionally]] made the [[Vanishment|glass disappear]], Piers and Dudley jumped back in surprise. When Piers told the Dursleys that Harry had been talking to the snake, they gave Harry his longest ever punishment.<ref name="PS2">{{PS|B|2}}</ref>

===[[1995]]===
{{Quote|Nice right hook, Big D.|Piers congratulating Dudley|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
During the summer of [[1995]], Dudley lied to his parents saying that he was at the Polkisses' having tea, although Piers was with Dudley's gang as they roamed the [[Little Whinging|neighbourhood]], bullying younger children.<ref name="OOTP1">{{OOTP|B|1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Piers is of Anglo-Saxon heritage and means "rock". It is a variant of Peter, from the Greek for "rock". Polkiss may be a variation of Polk, which itself is a variation of the Scottish names Pogue, Pollack, or Pollock, meaning "from the pool or pit".

==Behind the scenes==
*Due to being Dudley's closest friend of the group, Piers was most likely the gang's second-in-command.
*Piers was portrayed by [[Jason Boyd]] in {{OOTP|FA}}.
*Piers did not appear, nor was he even mentioned, in {{PS|FA}}.
*Piers has not appeared in {{LEGO|Y1}} and {{LEGO|Y2}}.
*It is mentioned several times in the books that all the members of Dudley's gang were big and stupid, but Piers was always described as being scrawny with a face like a rat. It is possible that Piers was scrawny when compared to the other members or that he gained a significant amount of weight after he went to the zoo with Dudley and Harry.
