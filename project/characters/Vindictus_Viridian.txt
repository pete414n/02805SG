'''Professor Vindictus Viridian''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was a [[potioneer]], author and [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early [[18th century|eighteenth century]].

==Biography==
===Lifetime===
Based on his portrait, Viridian was a [[potioneer]]. At some point in his life, he was named [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Also during his lifetime, he published a famous book on [[dark charm]]s: ''[[Curses and Counter-Curses|Curses and Counter-Curses (Bewitch your Friends and Befuddle your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and much, much more)]]''.

===Post-mortem===

Professor Viridian died sometime in or prior to [[1994]]. and hung in the Headmaster's office along with the portraits of other Headmasters and Headmistresses,

In the [[1995-1996 school year]], Viridian's portrait at the [[Grand Staircase]] was used to conceal the entrance to the [[Room of Rewards]]. He was frequently annoyed by all the hustle and bustle of the students' school life. In order to gain entry to the Room of Rewards, [[Hermione Granger]] threatened to convince [[Myrtle Warren]] to haunt the landing where the portrait hung. Disliking Myrtle, Viridian let [[Harry Potter]] and his friends through.
