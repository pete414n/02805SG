'''Daphne Greengrass''' (b. [[1979]]/[[1980]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and a member of the [[Greengrass family]], an old [[wizardkind|wizarding]] family and one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]''.'' She began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. She was in the same year as the famous [[Harry Potter]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Daphne Greengrass was born to [[pure-blood]] [[wizardkind|wizarding]]

It is unknown if the Greengrass sisters were raised to believe in the ideals of [[pure-blood supremacy]]. Their [[Greengrass family|family]] was one of the oldest, 'truest' pure-blood families in [[Great Britain|Britain]], and were counted among the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]. 

One of the sisters' distant [[Astoria Malfoy's ancestor|ancestors]] was [[curse]]d with a [[blood malediction]], which resurfaced in Astoria. It is unknown whether Daphne suffered from the same condition as her younger sister.

===Hogwarts years {{c|1991-1998}}===
On [[1 September]] [[1991]], Daphne began her education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]].

During her school years, it is unknown if she was a member of [[Pansy Parkinson]]'s '[[Pansy Parkinson's gang|gang]]' of Slytherin girls.

She took her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] in [[1996]] at the same time as [[Hermione Granger]]. The [[1996–1997 school year|following school year]], she was not one of the selected students who advanced to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level [[Potions (class)|Potions]], and thus she evidently failed to achieve the required grade or did not find continuing on to N.E.W.T. Potions worthwhile.

It is unknown if she was present during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on [[2 May]] [[1998]], or was led from the [[Great Hall]] by [[Argus Filch|Filch]] before, along with her fellow Slytherins.

===Later life===
Daphne's younger sister Astoria eventually married [[Draco Malfoy]], a fellow Slytherin in the same year as Daphne at Hogwarts. It is currently unknown whether Daphne herself ever married or had any children of her own.

In the summer of [[2019]], Daphne lost Astoria to the [[Blood malediction|blood curse]].

==Etymology==
The name Daphne means 'Laurel' in Greek. It is derived from the nymph {{wplink|Daphne}} in Greek mythology, who was pursued by the god Apollo. She prayed to her father, the river god Peneus, to change her body in order to escape the love-struck Apollo and Peneus then transformed her into the laurel tree, which Apollo then claimed as one of his sacred symbols. In Ancient Greece, a wreath of laurels was given as a prize and considered a symbol of prosperity, fame, and victory.

[[wikipedia:Daphne (plant)|Daphne]] is also the name of a plant noted for its fragrant flower, but for also being wholly [[poison]]ous.

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on a list of students revealed by J.K. Rowling in {{HPM}}, Daphne's first name may have originally been 'Queenie'. Eventually, [[Queenie Goldstein|another character would be named Queenie based on the original name]].
*[[:Unidentified blonde Slytherin girl|An individual]] is often said to have played Daphne Greengrass in the films, but there has been no link established. In fact, Daphne's blond-haired blue-eyed appearance originates from [[fanon]].
