==Biography==
===Early life===
Daphne Greengrass was born to [[pure-blood]] [[wizardkind|wizarding]]<ref name="blood-dh" /><ref name="hpm" /> parents in [[1979]] or [[1980]].<ref name="birth" /> She had at least one sibling, a sister, [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria]], who was two years younger than her.<ref name="leaky131">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1224-pottercast-anelli.html 24 December 2007 PotterCast interview with J. K. Rowling]</ref>

It is unknown if the Greengrass sisters were raised to believe in the ideals of [[pure-blood supremacy]].<ref>{{WW|draco-malfoy}}</ref> Their [[Greengrass family|family]] was one of the oldest, 'truest' pure-blood families in [[Great Britain|Britain]], and were counted among the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]].<ref name="pure blood">{{WW|pure-blood}}</ref> 

One of the sisters' distant [[Astoria Malfoy's ancestor|ancestors]] was [[curse]]d with a [[blood malediction]], which resurfaced in Astoria.<ref name="cc-4-4">{{CC|B|4|4}}</ref> It is unknown whether Daphne suffered from the same condition as her younger sister.

===Hogwarts years {{c|1991-1998}}===
On [[1 September]] [[1991]], Daphne began her education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]].<ref name="hpm" /><ref name="10thingsaboutHarry" />

During her school years, it is unknown if she was a member of [[Pansy Parkinson]]'s '[[Pansy Parkinson's gang|gang]]' of Slytherin girls.<ref name="10thingsaboutHarry" />

She took her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] in [[1996]] at the same time as [[Hermione Granger]].<ref name="ootp31">{{OOTP|B|31}}</ref> The [[1996–1997 school year|following school year]], she was not one of the selected students who advanced to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level [[Potions (class)|Potions]], and thus she evidently failed to achieve the required grade or did not find continuing on to N.E.W.T. Potions worthwhile.

It is unknown if she was present during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on [[2 May]] [[1998]], or was led from the [[Great Hall]] by [[Argus Filch|Filch]] before, along with her fellow Slytherins.

===Later life===
Daphne's younger sister Astoria eventually married [[Draco Malfoy]], a fellow Slytherin in the same year as Daphne at Hogwarts.<ref name="10thingsaboutHarry" /> She had a nephew, [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]], by this marriage.<ref name="epilogue">{{DH|B|E}}</ref> It is currently unknown whether Daphne herself ever married or had any children of her own.

In the summer of [[2019]], Daphne lost Astoria to the [[Blood malediction|blood curse]].<ref name="cc-4-4" /><ref name="cc-1-4">{{CC|B|1|4}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Daphne means 'Laurel' in Greek. It is derived from the nymph {{wplink|Daphne}} in Greek mythology, who was pursued by the god Apollo. She prayed to her father, the river god Peneus, to change her body in order to escape the love-struck Apollo and Peneus then transformed her into the laurel tree, which Apollo then claimed as one of his sacred symbols. In Ancient Greece, a wreath of laurels was given as a prize and considered a symbol of prosperity, fame, and victory.<ref>{{wikilink|Bay Laurel}}</ref><ref>https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Metamorphoses/Daphne_and_Apollo</ref>

[[wikipedia:Daphne (plant)|Daphne]] is also the name of a plant noted for its fragrant flower, but for also being wholly [[poison]]ous.

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on a list of students revealed by J.K. Rowling in {{HPM}}, Daphne's first name may have originally been 'Queenie'.<ref>{{WW|the-original-forty}}</ref> Eventually, [[Queenie Goldstein|another character would be named Queenie based on the original name]].
*[[:Unidentified blonde Slytherin girl|An individual]] is often said to have played Daphne Greengrass in the films, but there has been no link established. In fact, Daphne's blond-haired blue-eyed appearance originates from [[fanon]].
