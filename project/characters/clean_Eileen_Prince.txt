'''Eileen Snape''' (née '''Prince''') (born c. [[1930]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], wife to the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Tobias Snape]] and mother to [[Severus Snape]].



Eileen was born into the [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] [[Prince family]] in [[Great Britain]], likely around 1930. 

She likely began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] around 1941. Presumably, she was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin]]. While at school, Eileen was captain of the [[Hogwarts Gobstones Team|school Gobstones team]] during her fifth year. She was concurrently the President of the [[Hogwarts Gobstone Club]].


After graduating, Eileen met the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Tobias Snape]] and married him.

On [[9 January]], [[1960]], she gave birth to a son, [[Severus Snape]]. Severus' childhood was plagued by the tumultuous, explosive atmosphere in the home, with his parents often fighting. Tobias would shout at Eileen and may have been physically abusive as well.

The couple either neglected Severus, were too poor to care for him well, or both. His clothes were mismatched and did not fit properly. When he began his first year of school at Hogwarts, he changed into his uniform quickly after getting onto the [[Hogwarts Express]], apparently glad to be rid of his Muggle clothes. Despite this, Severus was already talented with magic before he received his [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|Hogwarts letter]] in [[1971]].

On [[1 September]], [[1971]], Eileen accompanied Severus to [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters]] at [[King's Cross Station]] and watched him leave on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. Whatever Eileen's thoughts on the matter were, Severus was exhilarated to leave for Hogwarts.


At age fifteen, Eileen was skinny and unattractive, looking simultaneously cross and sullen. She had heavy brows and a long, pallid face. By 1971, not much had changed: Eileen was thin, hunched, sour-faced and sallow.


''"Eileen"'' is from Celtic, English and Irish roots and has a long-standing history in each culture. In Irish, it is known as a variation of "''Helen''". It became a more popular name in the 19th century. It is rumoured to have roots in Latin, American, French and Greek cultures, however, such claims are not backed up with much evidence. Another variation of this name is Eileene which is most commonly used in Ireland.

Other versions of ''Eileen''; "''Aileen"'' (Scottish), "''Eibhlin"'' (the original source for the name), "''Eila"'' (Celtic variant of both "''Eileen"'' and "''Aileen"''), "''Eireen"'' (Norwegian variant of "''Irene''" or "''Eileen''"), "''Eleanor''" (a similarly-rooted name to "''Eileen''" in Irish).

Eileen's maiden name was ''[[Prince family|Prince]]. [[Wikipedia:Prince|Prince]]'' is a general term for a monarch or a member of a monarch's family, and is a hereditary title of some European royalty, likely alluding to the aristocratic status of pure-blood families in the [[wizarding world]]. The word is derived from the Latin ''[[Wikipedia:Princeps|princeps]]'', meaning "a prime", which was one of the titles of the Roman Emperor, in which case it was generally translated as "First Citizen". ''[[Wikipedia:The Prince|The Prince]]'' is also the title of a famous political treatise by Niccolò Machiavelli; an interesting point considering that the adjective derived from the author's surname, ''Machiavellian'', is defined as "attempting to achieve goals by cunning, scheming and unscrupulous methods", which may allude to the ideal traits of [[Slytherin]] house.



*'''[[Gobstones]]''': Eileen was a skilled Gobstones player, having been named captain of the [[Hogwarts Gobstones Team|team]] chosen to represent [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|her school]].


*Eileen's decision to marry Tobias may have resulted in her being disowned by her family — similar to [[Andromeda Tonks]], who was disowned by her family after she married [[Edward Tonks|a Muggle-born man]].
*Despite his upbringing, Severus was already talented with magic before he received his [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|Hogwarts letter]] in [[1971]]. It is possible that Eileen taught him these spells or that he taught himself from books she owned.
*It is unknown what happened to Eileen after her son began Hogwarts. By [[1996]], Severus had taken over the house at Spinner's End. She might have died, or perhaps she had moved out of her marital home at some point in the twenty-four years since. At Hogwarts, her son Severus used her surname and his blood status to make his nickname of "the Half-Blood Prince".
