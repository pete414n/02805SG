{{Quote|So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death!|''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'' by [[Beedle the Bard]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}
'''Antioch Peverell''' (fl. [[1214]]) was a [[pure-blood]]<ref name="blood"/> [[wizardkind|wizard]], the eldest of the [[Peverell family|Peverell brothers]]. Antioch, like his brothers, was skilled in the [[magic]]al arts, but personally was described as being a "combative man". Antioch and his brothers were the inspiration for the ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'' and thus the original masters of the [[Deathly Hallows]].<ref name="DH21"/> 

Antioch was said to have possessed the [[Elder Wand]],<ref name="DH21" /> though beyond Dumbledore's theory that he had crafted it himself and the story saying he had been murdered in his sleep for it, the exact circumstances of this are unknown.<ref name="DH35">{{DH|B|35}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Meeting Death===
[[File:The Tale of the Three Brothers - Death produces a wand.gif|left|thumb|245px|Death creates the [[Elder Wand]] for Antioch]]
In the ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'', the Peverell brothers are described as having received the Hallows from [[Death (The Tale of the Three Brothers)|Death]] himself, after using their magical talents to cross a treacherous river that would have assuredly killed them otherwise.

Antioch, for his prize, asked for "''a wand more powerful than any other in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered [[Death]]!''" and so Death crossed to an [[Elder]] tree on the banks of the river, made a wand from a branch, and gave it to Antioch.<ref name="DH21">{{DH|B|21}}</ref>

===Ownership of the Elder Wand and Death===
[[File:Antioch Peverell's Death.gif|thumb|245px|Antioch's last moments]] 
Later, the three brothers separated. Antioch travelled towards a distant village, and met a [[Antioch Peverell's enemy|wizard]] with whom he had a quarrel. With the [[Elder Wand]] as his weapon, Antioch easily won the [[Duelling|duel]] that followed and killed his opponent. Leaving his enemy dead, Antioch lodged in an [[Antioch Peverell's lodging place|inn]] to celebrate. In the inn he drunkenly boasted loudly of the powerful [[wand]] he had snatched "''from Death himself''", and of how it made him invincible. 

That night, as he slept, [[Antioch Peverell's killer|another wizard]] crept upon him, stole the wand, and slit his throat to make sure Antioch was unable to come after the thief afterwards.<ref name="DH21" />

===Post-mortem===
Following his death, Antioch was laid to rest in the churchyard by the [[St Jerome's Church|Parish Church of St. Clementine]], in [[Godric's Hollow]], along with his brothers [[Cadmus Peverell|Cadmus]] and [[Ignotus Peverell|Ignotus]].<ref name="Pottermore">{{PM}} - [https://www.pottermore.com/image/godrics-hollow-graveyard Explore the story: "Godric's Hollow graveyard"]</ref>

Antioch was a distant relative of both [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]] and [[Harry Potter]], as each was descended from one of his brothers, [[Cadmus Peverell]] and [[Ignotus Peverell]] respectively.<ref name="DH22">{{DH|B|22}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
According to ''The Tale of the Three Brothers'', Antioch was a man who desired beyond everything to be an all powerful wizard. Although he was already very powerful, he was not satisfied and immediately took his chance to gain [[Elder Wand|a wand]] from Death that would make him unbeatable.<ref name="DH21"/> 

Antioch's desire for such power made him blind to Death's true intentions, however, and he later proved to be very self-indulgent and weak-willed when he boasted about how powerful his new wand was to the public. Antioch was very irresponsible and unwise in this manner, consuming a dangerous amount of [[alcohol]] then leaving his wand and himself unprotected on the night of his murder. Antioch's recklessness and egotism caused him to be the first of the [[Peverell brothers]] to fall into Death's cunning hands.<ref name="DH21"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Antioch and his brothers were capable of using [[Conjuration]], a highly advanced form of magic to create a bridge stable enough to walk across (in the tale).<ref name="DH21"/>
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Antioch was very skilled in [[martial magic]] and was capable of killing an [[Antioch Peverell's enemy|opponent]] in a duel and coming out of the battle unscathed, though this was mostly due to his wielding of the Elder Wand (according to the tale).<ref name="DH21"/>
*'''Mastery of the [[Elder Wand]]''': Antioch was the first wizard to own and tame the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever made. However, at least in Beedle's tale, he was portrayed as a person unworthy of possessing such a wand. [[Albus Dumbledore]] and [[Harry Potter]] were qualified to own the Elder Wand because they would never use it for seeking power or murder. Antioch had done both (according to the tale).<ref name="DH21"/>
*'''[[Wandmaker|Wandmaking]]''' (possibly): No one knows for certain how Antioch came to posses the Elder Wand. Although {{TBB}} claimed that the wand was given to Antioch by [[Death (The Tale of the Three Brothers)|Death]],<ref name="DH21"/> however others, such as [[Albus Dumbledore]], theorised that Antioch created the wand himself.<ref name="DH35"/>

==Etymology==
*His name may be a reference to the city of [[Wikipedia:Antioch|Antioch]], a chief centre of early Christianity.
*"Antiochos" was, among other things, the name of several kings of the Hellenic Seleucid Empire.<ref>{{Wikilink|Antiochus}}</ref>
*The name "Antiochus" may refer to a number of figures in Greek mythology.<ref>{{Wikilink|Antiochus (mythology)}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Antioch concept.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Concept art of Antioch]]
*[[Albus Dumbledore]] believed it was more likely that the [[Deathly Hallows]] were invented by the [[Peverell brothers]] themselves, which would make Antioch the creator of the [[Elder Wand]]. Whether the account of his death from {{TBB}} is accurate is unknown. Given that there are no mean for Beedle to know of what really happened, it is assumed that it was simply fictionalised by Beedle.
*In the novel and film his killer slits his throat, but in the console versions of the video game, the thief kills him with the [[Killing Curse]]. In {{LEGO|Y2}} however, he was snatched by [[Death]] along with his brothers.
