'''[[Madam]]e Apolline Delacour''' was a [[half-Veela]] [[France|French]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who was married to [[Delacour sisters' father|Monsieur Delacour]]. She was described as beautiful with silver-blonde hair like her daughters, [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] and [[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]]; these traits were inherited from Apolline's [[Veela]] mother.


Apolline lived in France with her husband, whom she married at an unknown time. She had two daughters: the elder Fleur and the younger Gabrielle.

In [[1995]], Apolline and her husband visited Fleur before the Third Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

In the summer of [[1997]], the Delacours came to visit the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]] at [[the Burrow]] to prepare for Fleur's [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] to [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]]. While there, Apolline enjoyed [[Molly Weasley]]'s cooking and hospitality and helped with the preparations, as she was noted to be very accomplished with [[Household magic|household spells]]. During their visit, Apolline and her husband were shown to be very helpful, pleasant guests and people in general. She was seen listening to [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]'s corporeal [[Lynx]] [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], which warned the Wedding guests that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] had [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|fallen]] and that [[Death Eaters]] would soon be arriving. She, her husband and Gabrielle then safely evacuated the wedding, and returned to [[France]], with Bill and Fleur retreating to [[Shell Cottage]].

Through her daughter [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] and son-in-law [[William Weasley|Bill]], Apolline was the maternal grandmother of [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]] and [[Louis Weasley]].


Apolline, due to her [[Veela]] heritage, was described as a beautiful woman with silver-blonde hair, who wore long, green leafy robes to her [[Fleur Delacour|daughter's]] [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]].


Apolline was shown to be a very gracious and sophisticated woman, as she and her husband both happily helped the [[Weasley family]] prepare for the wedding of her daughter and son-in-law, and other wedding guests noted to her to have been pleasant and polite. She was also very grateful of Molly Weasley's cooking and hospitality whilst she stayed at her [[The Burrow|house]]. Furthermore, she was shown to be a good mother who loved and cared for her family, as she visited her daughter [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] before she took part in the Third Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], showing her to have been very supportive and proud of her daughter's achievements.
