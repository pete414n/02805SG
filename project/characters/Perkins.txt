'''Perkins''' (fl. [[1975]] - [[1998]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[warlock]] who worked in the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], as a subordinate of [[Arthur Weasley]], who was head of the office.

==Biography==
During the [[Quidditch World Cup]] in [[1994]], Perkins lent his supervisor, [[Arthur Weasley]], a [[Perkins's tent|tent]] so he and his [[Weasley family|family]] could camp out after the match. Perkins allowed the Weasleys to keep the tent after his [[lumbago]] got worse and he no longer had any interest in camping. His tent would later be used by [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] during their [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|search]] for [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort's]] [[Horcrux]]es.

Perkins met [[Harry Potter]] in [[1995]] when the boy was summoned before the [[Wizengamot]] to answer a charge of using magic in front of a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]. In [[1997]], he attended the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]].

==Physical appearance==
He was described as being an elderly [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who had fluffy white hair.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': As part of his career duties as an employee for the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]], Perkins often had to use the [[Memory Charm]] to erase the [[Memory|memories]] of unsuspecting [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] who had witnessed [[magic]].

==Possessions==
*'''[[Perkins's tent|Tent]]''': Perkins owned a tent which was [[charm]]ed to be [[Extension Charm|magically enlarged]]. Perkins lent his tent to [[Arthur Weasley]] to use for the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]].

==Etymology==
''Perkins'' is an [[England|English]] surname meaning "son of little Peter".

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]] once erroneously called [[Harry Potter]] "Perkins".
*In {{OOTP|FA}} it is [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] instead of Perkins who tells Arthur Weasley that the time and venue of Harry Potter's hearing had been changed. 
*In the German version of the fourth book, Perkins was incorrectly referred to as Mrs Perkins.
