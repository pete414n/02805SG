'''Fleur Isabelle''' '''Weasley''' (née '''Delacour''') (b. c. [[1976]]-[[1977]]) was a [[France|French]] quarter-[[Veela]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], one of the daughters of [[Apolline Delacour]] and [[Delacour sisters' father|her husband]], the other daughter being the younger [[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]]. Fleur attended [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]]. During the [[1994–1995 school year]], she was Beauxbatons' champion in the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Fleur competed bravely, but the Tournament ended in tragedy with the murder of [[Cedric Diggory]] and the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].

In the following summer, Fleur took a part-time job at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] to improve her English, and began dating her co-worker [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]]. The pair soon became engaged and Fleur stayed at [[The Burrow]] in the summer of [[1996]] to get to know Bill's family better, a fact that [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] greatly disliked, nicknaming her 'Phlegm'.

Fleur arrived at Hogwarts in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] in [[1997]] during which her fiancé was badly injured by the [[werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]]. The pair were [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|married]] in August of that year; however the wedding was disrupted by [[Death Eaters]] following the fall of the [[Ministry of Magic]]. Fleur and Bill took up residence at [[Shell Cottage]], and later assisted [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] with [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s quest following their escape from [[Malfoy Manor]], offering them room and board. Fleur fought alongside her husband in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]].

After the [[Second Wizarding War]], she and Bill had three children; [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], and [[Louis Weasley]]. She was awarded [[Fleur Delacour's medals of bravery|medals of bravery]] by both the [[French Ministry of Magic|French]] and [[British Ministry of Magic|British Ministries of Magic]] for her participation in the Battle of Hogwarts.



Fleur was quarter-[[veela]], and grew up in France. She grew up with her father [[Delacour sisters' father|Monsieur Delacour]] and her half-veela mother [[Apolline Delacour]]. She also had a younger sister, Gabrielle. Fleur's grandmother was full Veela and at some point contributed a [[Veela hair|hair]] that would later become the core element of Fleur's wand.


At an unknown point in time Fleur began attending Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.

Triwizard champion

During her last school year in [[1994]] she, along with Beauxbatons' Headmistress Madame [[Olympe Maxime]] and a dozen other Beauxbatons students travelled to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Her school did this to enter in the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. They arrived in a huge, powder-blue chariot pulled by roughly a dozen flying horses on [[30 October]] at around 6:00 pm.

]]
Fleur laughed derisively and rudely during [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s speech during the [[Welcoming Feast]]. Part way through the feast, she walked over to the Gryffindor table to ask [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] for the [[bouillabaisse]] in front of him. On her way back, she caught the eyes of most of the other boys in the Great Hall.


Fleur placed her name in the [[Goblet of Fire]], and during the [[Hallowe'en Feast]], was selected to be Beauxbatons' student representative and Triwizard Champion. While awaiting further instructions in a small room off the [[Great Hall]], she learned that the Goblet of Fire had selected a fourth Champion — [[Harry Potter]]. When [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] told her what happened, she first thought he was joking, then was surprised and outraged that they were to let a ''"little boy"'' compete in the Tournament.

Prior to the [[Dragon Challenge|First Task]], Fleur took part in the [[Wand weighing ceremony]] presided over by [[Garrick Ollivander]]. After being handed the wand, it produced pink and gold sparks and was confirmed, by Fleur, to contain a [[Veela hair]] as a core; a gift from [[Apolline Delacour's mother|her grandmother]]. Ollivander described [[Fleur Delacour's wand|her wand]] as "''inflexible''", and in great working condition when it produced a bouquet of flowers without problem. Fleur's entrance into the Tournament was overshadowed in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' due to Harry Potter's participation; she was only mentioned in the last line of [[Rita Skeeter]]'s article, with her name misspelled. This likely annoyed Fleur.

First Task

s, the first task, to test the champion's daring and nerve]]
Forewarned by [[Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] that the First Task would involve [[dragon]]s, Fleur tackled the task on [[24 November]] [[1994]]. To eliminate all advantages, the champions were made to choose a dragon at random. She drew the [[Common Welsh Green]], and faced her dragon second after [[Cedric Diggory]]. She managed to lure the dragon into a [[bewitched sleep|sleeping trance]], but was immobilised when the dragon snored and released a jet of flame that set her skirt on fire. Fleur extinguished the fire with [[Water-Making Spell|water]] from her wand, then managed to retrieve the [[golden egg]].

The Yule Ball and Second Task

In the run-up to the [[Yule Ball]], Fleur attempted to attract Cedric as a date, but he had already asked [[Cho Chang]]. Caught unaware by her Veela heritage, Ron Weasley spontaneously and unwisely asked her to the ball, to which her initial reaction was seeming disdain and shock. Suddenly aware of what he had done he ran away before she could answer him. This left Ron feeling incredibly embarrassed for several days to come and word spread around the Gryffindor common room.

]]
Finally, Fleur selected [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]] captain [[Roger Davies]] as her partner. Roger was completely helpless to her charms and to whom she spent some of the night complaining about the flaws of Hogwarts and the British Wizarding education system in general. Fleur and Roger, along with the other Champions and their partners opened the dancing at the Yule Ball. As the night wore on Fleur and Roger left the Great Hall and headed for the gardens, sneaking into the rose bushes for a romantic engagement of some kind.

 right before she was attacked by [[Grindylow]]s]]

On [[24 February]], Fleur participated in the Second Task. Having figured out the clue in the golden egg and understanding the need to breathe underwater for an hour, she chose to use the [[Bubble-Head Charm]]. During the Task, she was attacked by [[Grindylow]]s and was forced to retreat. Unaware that the hostages were not in any real danger, she was quite hysterical and fought so hard to return to the water that even [[Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] had difficulty restraining her. 

She was overjoyed when [[Harry Potter|Harry]], determined to rescue all the hostages, not just his own, returned to the surface with both [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], his hostage, and her sister and hostage, [[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]]. She thanked him and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] profusely by giving them a kiss on each cheek, and after the incident became friendly toward the two. From then on she came to view Harry as a respected friend. Upon learning that she had been awarded twenty-five points, she remarked that she deserved zero, as she had failed to retrieve her hostage. After the first two tasks, Fleur was in last place going into the Third Task.

Third Task
On [[27 May]] [[1995]], Fleur joined the other Champions in viewing the beginnings of the maze for the Third Task on the site of the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Quidditch pitch]]. On the morning of the Third Task, Fleur was visited by her mother and Gabrielle who had been invited to watch the final part of the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. She also laid eyes on [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] for the first time, and was immediately attracted to him.


Being in last place, Fleur was to be last to enter the maze behind Harry Potter, Cedric Diggory, and [[Viktor Krum]]. 

When Harry returned with Cedric's dead body, who had been murdered by [[Peter Pettigrew]], Fleur and her fellows from Beauxbatons were the first to realise Cedric was dead and were horrified; Fleur herself let out a scream and clapped her hands over her mouth.


After the Triwizard Tournament and the murder of Cedric Diggory, Fleur attended the [[End-of-Term Feast|Leaving Feast]] at Hogwarts. This feast served as a memorial to Cedric. During the feast she was seen being very upset, as Cedric was a friend of hers. Fleur left Hogwarts the day after with her family, saying goodbye to Harry and Ron. She kissed Harry on the cheek and proceeded to tell him that she hoped they would meet again. She was hoping to return to [[England]] to work and improve her patchy English.




During the summer of [[1995]], Fleur secured a part-time job at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]]. It was then that she was reacquainted with [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], who had returned from Egypt and taken a desk job to help the [[Order of the Phoenix]], and the two began dating. Fleur and Bill dated for a year until Bill proposed to her. Fleur accepted, and in the summer of [[1996]], Bill brought Fleur to [[The Burrow]] so she could get to know his family. She was delighted to know that Harry was going to stay with the Weasleys for the remainder of the summer.

However, her blunt nature and critical attitude created conflict between her and the female members of the [[Weasley family]], including [[Hermione Granger]]. [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]] did not care for Fleur at all, believing that she was not the right choice for her son. [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] and Hermione disliked her for her general attitude towards everything; Ginny gave Fleur the nickname "''Phlegm''," although they never openly used it in front of her and Fleur was tolerated for Bill's sake.


Battle of the Astronomy Tower

On [[30 June]] [[1997]], during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] Bill was brutally savaged by the [[werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]]. Because Greyback was not transformed, Bill did not become a werewolf, but rather developed some wolf-like qualities (such as a preference for  steaks). Fleur rushed to Hogwarts with Bill's parents and was shaken by Bill's scarred face. She fired up at once at Mrs Weasley's assumption that she would not now want to marry Bill, since he was no longer attractive. Taking offence she criticised both the idea that she would not wish to marry him out of vanity, and that his feelings may have changed towards her because of possible werewolf contamination.


Fleur in fact, took pride in his wounds as living proof of his bravery and stated she didn't care about how he looked as she was "''good-looking enough for both of them''." Mrs Weasley, finally seeing that Fleur and Bill were truly in [[love]], reconciled with her future daughter-in-law over Bill's hospital bed, and offered Fleur the use of her [[Muriel|Aunt Muriel]]'s [[goblin]]-made [[Muriel's tiara|tiara]] for her wedding day.

Battle of the Seven Potters

On [[27 July]] [[1997]], four days before Harry's seventeenth birthday, Fleur was part of the effort to get Harry safely to [[The Burrow]] and participated in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters|battle]] that ensued. She participated in the battle out of loyalty to Harry, when he previously saved her sister's life in 1995. She took on the role of one of the fake Harrys, using [[Polyjuice Potion]] to take on his physical appearance. Paired with Bill, the two were to fly north on a [[Thestral]] in an effort to fool any pursuing [[Death Eaters]].


After departing, Fleur and Bill personally witnessed the death of [[Alastor Moody]]. This happened after a dozen or more Death Eaters descended on the Order in an effort to capture Harry. Fleur and Bill were chased by half a dozen Death Eaters, but managed to escape and return to the Burrow and relay the news. Fleur was greatly upset over Moody's death and voiced the opinion that someone may have betrayed them, as the Death Eaters seemed to know the plan to escort Harry to safety.

Marriage


On [[1 August]], [[1997]], Fleur and Bill [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|were married]] at The Burrow. The ceremony and reception took place in a marquee tent which "''revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet.''"

White and gold flowers and golden balloons were some of the many unique elements added to the occasion. [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] and [[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]] were both bridesmaids. Fleur wore a simple white dress and Muriel's tiara, and looked so beautiful that she seemed to have a beautifying effect on everyone around her, and Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback. The celebration was overshadowed, though, by the news that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] had fallen to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and the death of [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]. Death Eaters, with the full power of the Ministry behind them, broke the protective spells surrounding the Burrow and [[Apparition|Apparated]] into the reception. Fleur was questioned by them, along with the rest of the [[Weasley family]] on the whereabouts of Harry Potter, but was later free to go.


Fleur and Bill relocated to [[Shell Cottage]], and spent their first Christmas there together, along with Bill's younger brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], who had secretly come to stay with them after abandoning [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] on their [[Horcrux]] hunt.

Following Harry, Ron, and Hermione's escape from [[Malfoy Manor]], Fleur helped to look after them and their fellow escapees: [[Dean Thomas]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Garrick Ollivander]], and [[Griphook]]. She helped Hermione recover from the [[Cruciatus Curse|torture]] she suffered at the hands of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], and healed Griphook's legs with [[Skele-Gro]]. Over the course of the next few weeks, she looked after her unexpected guests, although she disliked Griphook. When Ollivander was well enough to be transferred to Aunt Muriel's, she asked him to take Muriel's tiara back with him as she never had a chance to return it after the wedding. Fleur expressed concern over Harry's plans to leave Shell Cottage on his quest, telling him it was better for him to stay where it was safe.

Battle of Hogwarts
]]
Alongside her husband and his family, Fleur answered [[Neville Longbottom]]'s call to arms to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. During the tense reunion between [[Percy Weasley]] and his family, she led Harry Potter and [[Remus Lupin]] in a side conversation regarding Lupin's son, so they would not intrude. Fleur would have witnessed the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort, thus ending the Second Wizarding War.



Following the war, Fleur and Bill had three children; [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], and [[Louis Weasley]].




Due to her part-[[Veela]] heritage, Fleur was a breathtakingly beautiful witch, and hence caught a good deal of attention from many males. She was tall and willowy, with an air of grace that made her seem like she was gliding when she was walking, and her very presence seemed to "''emanate a faint, silvery glow''". She had long, silvery-blonde hair that fell almost to her waist, large, deep blue eyes, fair skin, and very white, even teeth. 

Her beauty "''usually dimmed everyone else by comparison''". However, on her wedding day, her extreme happiness allowed her beauty to affect everyone near her, making them beautiful as well, to the point where no one could tell that her husband had his face scarred by [[Fenrir Greyback]].

Ron Weasley (who would later become Fleur's brother-in-law) usually made a fool of himself in attempts to get Fleur to notice him and kiss him on the cheek. Ginny Weasley and Hermione Granger usually remarked on this being "''pathetic''."



In her youth, Fleur was arrogant and conceited. Because of her beauty, she saw herself as 'a cut above' most others. For instance, when [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] asked her to go to the Yule Ball with him, she "''looked at him as though he were a sea slug''." Her only redeeming feature seemed to be her genuine concern for her sister ([[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]]), as seen when she fought to return to the water to save her. She fought despite having previously suffered an attack by [[Grindylow]]s in the Second Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]].

Fleur also had a very blunt nature, always speaking her mind. Therefore, she often came off as rude and snobbish. She once made insulting comments about the state of the Hogwarts [[Christmas]] decorations and later made comments about Mrs Weasley (her future mother-in-law)'s home. This snobbish attitude was what made most other women, especially Molly and Ginny Weasley, dislike her.

However, despite her high opinion of herself, Fleur's softer side was warm and caring. She showed this softer side after [[Harry Potter]] saved her sister from the [[Great Lake]]. Her attitude towards him changed and she started treating him with affection and respect. She fretted over the safety of those she loved, and if someone she cared about was in trouble she would always try to help them. She was also not a superficial person. 
 for her husband]]
In [[1997]], after the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] — when her fiancé, [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], was in the hospital wing, Fleur insisted on treating his wounds herself, taking the ointment from [[Molly Weasley]]. When Molly lamented over how the wedding was to be cancelled because of Bill's wounds, Fleur took offence at the implication of her being a shallow person and retorted that she loved Bill for more than his good looks, even stating that his acquired scars were — to her — proof of her husband's bravery. 

This genuine demonstration of her valuing true worth over surface glitter was what made those who initially disapproved of her (such as Molly and Ginny Weasley) finally begin to accept her. She also was also more perceptive than she appeared to be, as she correctly suspected that Molly had hoped Bill's injuries would cause Fleur to reject him and call off the wedding. This meant that she had known all along that Molly (and others) disliked her.

After being married in the summer of [[1997]], one could see more of Fleur's positive qualities: her true courage and fierce loyalty. She had never forgotten that Harry once saved her sister's life; she was fiercely loyal to him and escorted him from [[4 Privet Drive]], risking both her life and that of her fiance's. She also allowed Harry to stay at her [[Shell Cottage|home]] and even honoured his request that the [[goblin]] ([[Griphook]]) be allowed to stay as well. While she played host to Harry, Hermione, Ron, and the others at her home. Harry noticed Fleur had become a lot more like her mother-in-law (Molly Weasley), as she displayed traits similar to Molly's. These traits included worrying excessively and fussing in a maternal fashion over him and his friends.

In 2014, Rita Skeeter referred to Fleur as "doubtless empty-headed", although as Skeeter was a very unreliable source, this statement was likely untrue.



Fleur was a talented and able [[Wizardkind|witch]], which was shown by her selection as the Beauxbatons [[Triwizard Tournament|Champion]] by the [[Goblet of Fire]]. Though circumstances in the Tournament conspired against her, as she was unable to fully showcase her talents, she proved her [[magic]]al skill, by her participation and survival in subsequent battles.
*'''[[Veela]] [[Veela Magic|attraction]]''': As a quarter-[[Veela]], Fleur had the ability to attract men with her beauty. Although her ability was not as strong as that of a full Veela, she was still able to make herself ravishing enough to completely overwhelm unsuspecting individuals if she wanted to. When in an elated or euphoric state, Fleur's Veela attraction enhanced the physical attractiveness of all within a given radius of her, to the point where one could hardly even tell that her husband had his face scarred after he fought [[Fenrir Greyback]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Fleur was shown to have been highly proficient with charm-work. During the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament, she proficiently used both a [[bewitched sleep]] and the [[Water-Making Spell]]. a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability and testament to her talent in charms.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Fleur was capable of performing [[spell]]s nonverbally, which is a mark of superior magical ability as nonverbal magic is very difficult.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Fleur was also a skilful duellist, as proven during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], both of which she both entered and finished in good health.
*'''[[Household magic]]''': At the time Harry, Ron, and Hermione stayed at her and Bill's house, Fleur seemed to have developed a talent for household spells: cleaning and making dinner with magic, just like her mother-in-law.
*'''Bilingualism:''' Fleur spoke her native French, as well as fluent English, albeit the latter with a strong French accent.




*'''[[Fleur Delacour's wand|Wand]]''': The wand of Fleur Delacour was 9½" [[rosewood]], with a [[Veela]] [[Veela hair|hair]] core. The hair was donated by Fleur's grandmother. When the wand was weighed by [[Garrick Ollivander|Mr Ollivander]] during the Triwizard Tournament, in which Fleur was Beauxbatons' champion, he described it as "''inflexible''".
*'''[[Fleur Delacour's dress robes|Dress Robes]]''': These dress robes were worn by Fleur to the [[Yule Ball]] in [[1994–1995 school year|1994]] as part of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] at Hogwarts,
*'''[[Fleur Delacour's wedding dress|Wedding dress]]''': This wedding dress was worn by Fleur at her wedding to [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] on 1 August, [[1997]]. The dress was described as a white dress.
*'''[[Fleur Delacour's medals of bravery|Medals of bravery]]''': Fleur's medals of bravery were awarded to her some point after 2 May, [[1998]] by the British and French Ministries of Magic, respectively, for her participation in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].



Delacour family

, her little sister]]
Fleur seemed to have a pleasant relationship with her parents when they arrived at [[the Burrow]] for [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|her wedding]] with Bill; her [[Veela|half-Veela]] mother, [[Apolline Delacour|Apolline]], proved to be very helpful and had a knack for household spells, and her father was a jovial man who seemed to find everything at the Burrow charming. After the [[Second Wizarding War]], they had three grandchildren through Fleur.

Fleur had a very close relationship with her sister, [[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]]. During the Second Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], Gabrielle was taken into the [[Great Lake|lake]] as the thing Fleur would sorely miss. After [[Harry Potter]] appeared to have saved Gabrielle's life by risking a high score to rescue her from the lake, Fleur warmed to him quite a bit, and took to kissing his cheeks when she saw him. Gabrielle also developed a crush on Harry. At her wedding, Fleur made Gabrielle one of her bridesmaids, along with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] (Much to Ginny's dislike, as at the time she did not much like Fleur and had taken to calling her phlegm behind her back).

Bill Weasley

, her husband and father of her children]]
Fleur first encountered Bill Weasley just prior to the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, when he accompanied [[Molly Weasley|his mother]] to Hogwarts to support Harry Potter. She was attracted to him from the start, eyeing him with visible interest from across the room while in the company of her parents. In the summer of [[1995]], Fleur took a part-time job with [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] to improve her English. Bill had taken a desk job at the bank so that he could assist the [[Order of the Phoenix]], and the two meet and began dating immediately.

They had been dating for a year when Bill asked Fleur to marry him, and she accepted. Although his family — at least, his mother and sister — took an initial disliking of her because of her seemingly snobbish personality, they accepted her when she showed how much she really loved Bill following his scarring at the hands of [[Fenrir Greyback]] in 1997. Before the couple got married, Bill helped Fleur's English at his work at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts Bank]].


They were married on [[1 August]], [[1997]], the same day that the Ministry of Magic fell to Lord Voldemort. Although their wedding was disrupted by Death Eaters, Fleur and Bill were allowed to go free and set up home in [[Shell Cottage]]. Following the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Fleur bore him three beautiful children, (eldest to youngest), [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], and [[Louis Weasley|Louis]].

Children
After the events of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Fleur bore three children; Victoire, who was named after the victory of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and [[Dumbledore's Army]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], because she was born on the anniversary of the battle; Dominique and Louis. In [[2017]], it was implied that Victoire was in a relationship with [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]]. Since Fleur began to emulate her mother-in-law, it is likely she was very warm and caring towards her children and loved them dearly.

Harry Potter

, her friend and future brother-in-law]]
Fleur treated Harry Potter patronisingly at first, partly because she felt he was too young to participate in the Triwizard Tournament, and also because she believed that he must have cheated his way in for personal glory. At one point she even referred to him as a "''little boy''". However, after he rescued her sister from the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]] in the [[Triwizard Tournament#The Second Task|Second Task]] of the tournament, her attitude and treatment towards him grew considerably warmer and she came to respect him very much. By [[1996]], they considered themselves friends and recognised each other as valuable allies.

While Fleur stayed at [[The Burrow]] in the summer of 1996, Harry seemed to be the only male who was unaffected by Fleur's beauty. This was possibly due to the platonic relationship that developed between them over the course of the tournament. At the Burrow, Fleur showed affection for Harry and treated him in a similar way as Mrs Weasley. She once brought him a breakfast tray while he was in bed and would often kiss him on both cheeks twice as a form of greeting and farewell. Like [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Arthur Weasley]], Harry appeared to like Fleur and would defend her, much to the dismay of Molly, Hermione, and Ginny.

Eventually, Fleur joined the Order of the Phoenix and in [[1997]] she put herself in great danger during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], acting as one of Harry's decoys. She was also very loyal to Harry. When her wedding was gatecrashed by [[Death Eaters]], she did not tell them that Harry had been present.

After Harry and several others came to her home at Shell Cottage the same year, Fleur tended to their wounds and generally took care of all of them. Having so many people at her home tested her patience, but she was still kind to Harry, of whom she still had a high opinion because of his efforts to save her sister. Through his marriage to Ginny Weasley, Harry became Fleur's brother-in-law and uncle to her three children. It's quite possible that Harry became close to Fleur's children and in return she became close to his. Due to their common ground as surviving Triwizard Champions, Harry and Fleur share a unique sense of camaraderie. This camaraderie reinforced their familial bond. Harry, as a frequent guest lecturer on [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] at Hogwarts, likely gave Fleur's children a chance to learn from their esteemed uncle in a non-familial perspective.

Weasley family


The [[Weasley family|Weasleys]]' reaction to Fleur, with the exceptions of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]], was initially lukewarm. They became more annoyed with Fleur when she and Bill became engaged, but tolerated her presence for his sake.

Ron always had a soft side for Fleur, he always stuck up for her. Once he asked her to go to the [[Yule Ball]] but ran away before she had a chance to answer him. However, she became his sister-in-law in 1997 and they started having a friendly relationship. While Ron, Harry, and Hermione stayed at her house, Fleur cared about them in a mother-like way.

Molly and Ginny Weasley in particular did not like Fleur, considering her snooty and snobbish. Molly was irked by Fleur's criticism of her household and her favourite singer, [[Celestina Warbeck]], and Ginny called her "''Phlegm''", due to her throaty, French accent, and made fun of her behind her back. However, when Fleur did not break off their engagement following Bill's injuries, the Weasleys saw how deeply she loved Bill, and became much more accepting of her. Molly convinced her Aunt [[Muriel]] to lend Fleur her tiara for the wedding, and Ginny served as one of Fleur's bridesmaids. Muriel herself remarked that Fleur was indeed beautiful, which considering her usual personality was impressive, but of course also expressed disappointment with her French blood.

Hermione Granger

, her future sister-in-law]]
Hermione Granger met Fleur during the Triwizard Tournament. She almost immediately grew to dislike her, as the beautiful French witch had a tendency to complain frequently and loudly about most aspects of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Fleur often compared Hogwarts unfavourably with her own [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|school]]. When Hermione met Fleur again at The Burrow, she found the latter to be arrogant and self-obsessed. This opinion shared by Ginny and [[Molly Weasley]]. The fact that Ron had a very obvious crush on Fleur also didn't do much to improve her standing in Hermione's eyes.

However, Hermione saw Fleur in a much different light after Bill was attacked by [[Fenrir Greyback]], and Fleur made it clear that Bill's now heavily scarred appearance didn't change her feelings for him in the slightest. Fleur later risked her life along with Hermione to act as one of [[Battle of the Seven Potters|Harry's decoys]] in 1997. 

After Hermione was tortured by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] at [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], Fleur tended to her injuries. She also tended the injuries sustained by the others who had been detained there, and generally fussed over all of them in a motherly fashion. The two finally fought alongside one another during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and became sisters-in-law through Fleur's marriage to Bill, and Hermione's marriage to Ron.

Nieces and nephews
Fleur also had many nieces and nephews, through the [[Weasley family]]. Percy and [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey]]'s daughters, [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]] and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]]; George and [[Angelina Johnson]]'s children, [[Fred Weasley II|Fred]] and [[Roxanne Weasley|Roxanne]]; Ron and Hermione's children, [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]]; Ginny and Harry's children, [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]]. It is likely that Fleur was close with all of them. It's unknown if she eventually had any nieces or nephews through her sister Gabrielle.




Olympe Maxime was the headmistress of [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] during Fleur's time at the school. Madam Maxime was indignant at the inclusion of Harry Potter in the Triwizard Tournament, and supported Fleur's efforts to win completely; when Harry saw Maxime when Hagrid showed him the First Task's [[dragon]]s, he had no doubts that Maxime would have told Fleur all about them. Fleur presumably remained in close contact with her headmistress, as she invited her to the wedding.


, Fleur's partner at the Yule Ball]]
During [[1994]], Fleur attended the [[Yule Ball]] as the partner of [[Roger Davies]]. He was apparently too smitten by her [[Half-Veela|part-Veela]] charm to take note of anything she said, most of which was criticism of Hogwarts, while constantly missing his own mouth with the fork during dinner. The two apparently enjoyed their time together, as they had a romantic night within the bushes during the later parts of the Ball. However, they did not keep in contact after the [[Triwizard Tournament]] ended, as Fleur married Bill Weasley.


As [[Viktor Krum]] and Fleur were both the Triwizard champions for their schools, [[Durmstrang Institute]] and [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] respectively, they viewed each other as competition during the Triwizard Tournament. They maintained their friendship and she invited him to her wedding to William Weasley in 1997.



Fleur became a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Her relationship with most fellow members is unknown; it is possible that she and the rest of the order had a good relationship.

She was at least somewhat friendly with [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]], though she seemed to think little of Tonks's efforts in terms of her appearance in [[1996]]. It was also Fleur's public declaration that she would still marry Bill, despite his attack by the [[Werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]], that inspired Tonks to publicly declare her love for Lupin. Fleur fought alongside both in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], she was also thrilled to learn Tonks had given birth to a baby boy. By [[2017]], Tonks and Remus's son, [[Edward Lupin|Teddy]], was seen kissing Bill and Fleur's daughter, Victoire.

Fleur was also clearly fond of [[Alastor Moody]], as she was visibly distraught by his death in [[1997]], and was seen crying.



Fleur cared for a number of people at Shell Cottage following the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]]: she became friendly with [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Dean Thomas]] and [[Garrick Ollivander]], seeming especially fond of the last. Fleur asked the [[wandmaker]] to return the tiara she had worn for [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|her wedding]] to Bill's Aunt [[Muriel]].

Fleur appeared to get on well with her fellow champion [[Cedric Diggory]] as they were seen talking to each other often. Harry theorised that Fleur attempted to ask Cedric to the Yule Ball using her Veela charms but this is not confirmed. 

Fleur disliked the [[goblin]] [[Griphook]], who treated her as if she was a lowly maid; though it was clear to Harry that Griphook's behaviour was frustrating Fleur, she mostly kept her feelings to herself, as Griphook was still in poor health.
