 
'''Ernest "Ernie" Prang'''  was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was the driver of the [[Knight Bus]].



Ernest Prang's origin is unknown. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, and was a member of [[Gryffindor]] house. Eventually, he began driving the [[Knight Bus]]. He worked with [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]], the conductor of the Knight Bus, who sometimes called Ernie by his nickname, Ern. 



[[Harry Potter]] first encountered Prang in [[1993]], when he was picked up by the [[Knight Bus]] after leaving his [[Petunia Dursley|Aunt]] and [[Vernon Dursley|Uncle]]'s [[4 Privet Drive|house]]. When Harry was taken to the [[Leaky Cauldron]] Ernie followed him in and was forced to leave by [[Cornelius Fudge]], the then-Minister of Magic.

Ernie was also present at [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] in [[1997]].


Prang was described as an elderly grey-haired wizard with very thick glasses, giving him an "[[owl]]ish" appearance.


Prang was very clearly committed to his driving, and seldom talked much to passengers on the Knight Bus. (leaving that to Stan Shunpike, preferring to concentrate on his driving). He also was clearly a supporter of [[Albus Dumbledore]], following his decision to attend his funeral, implying he also supported the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and its goals as well.

Prang's driving skills left much to be desired and were in dire need of improvement, as he frequently drove off the road and into objects, such as post boxes, lamp posts and trees. This may have been at least partly due to the bus' extreme speed. Fortunately, due to the bus' magical nature, the objects got out of the way.


Ernie Prang and [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]], the driver and conductor of the [[Knight Bus]], were named after [[J. K. Rowling]]'s grandfathers, Ernest Arthur Rowling and Stanley George Volant, respectively. Ernie's last name is a play on words, as "prang" is English slang meaning "to wreck an automobile".


*In , Ernie is played by the late [[Jimmy Gardner]].
*In the 2004  set 4755 [[Knight Bus]], Prang was replaced by [[Stanley Shunpike]] as the driver of the [[Knight Bus]]. Despite this, Prang was included later in the 2011 remake set 4866 [[Knight Bus]].
