'''Fang''' (b. circa [[1984]]) was an over-sized [[boarhound]] [[dog]], and one of [[Rubeus Hagrid's pets]]. and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. He survived the war and was still alive and well in the late [[2000s]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|Why don't you name him Fang? I've always liked that name for a dog.|A student recommends the name Fang|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
[[File:Fang pup1.png|250px|thumb|left|Fang as a little puppy, fetching a stick]]
Fang was born in around [[1984]], and became [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s pet by [[September]] of the same year. He was seen as a puppy on the school grounds fetching a stick and bolting down the hill back towards [[Hagrid's Hut]].

In [[1985]], Fang was trapped by the same [[Devil's Snare]] which Hagrid had rescued [[Jacob's sibling]] from the year before. Hagrid asked them if they could help him with the Devil's Snare the second time, being aware that using the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]] would only cause the dangerous plant to retreat further into the room in which it had been placed, placing Fang's life in danger.

[[File:Fang.png|250px|thumb|right|Fang relaxing in his master's hut]]Hagrid told Jacob's sibling to help him by brewing a [[Fire-Breathing Potion]]. Hagrid decided not to share what the potion was for, because he was embarrassed about his failure to keep a close enough eye on his pup and merely recited the ingredients. Jacob's sibling, [[Rowan Khanna]], [[Ben Copper]], and [[Penny Haywood]] eventually made the potion. Hagrid then told Jacob's sibling why he needed the potion, and they saved Fang from the Devil's Snare by using the potion. Hagrid then revealed he had not named the puppy yet, and they decide on the name Fang.

At some point during the [[1985–1986 school year]], Fang became afraid of [[cat]]s, mostly due to [[Mrs Norris]]. Jacob's sibling, Rowan, Penny and [[Minerva McGonagall]] helped him overcome his fear and prepare for the [[pet gathering]].

{{Dialogue a-b|Jacob's sibling|You think Fang is brave...?|Rubeus Hagrid|Well, sometimes. When he's not sleepy. Or playful. At any rate, don't test him, alright?|Jacob's sibling and Hagrid discussing Fang in the [[1980s]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
By September [[1986]], Fang enjoyed kipping in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] and hanging out in the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] [[Classroom 1B|Classroom]] because he saw a cat in there once, which was actually [[Minerva McGonagall]] in [[Animagus]] form.

At the beginning of the [[1986–1987 school year]], Fang went missing when he was scared by a [[fairy]] he found in the [[Rubeus Hagrid's pumpkin patch|pumpkin patch]] by Hagrid's Hut. Hagrid once again asked Jacob's sibling to help him. Hagrid then searched the [[Forbidden Forest]], telling them Fang once ran in there and couldn't find the way out.

[[File:Wizard Fang HM720.png|thumb|right|250px|Fang disguised as a wizard]]
During the [[1990–1991 school year]], [[Jacob's sibling]] and their friends disguised Fang as a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] with a pointed wizard's hat and blue shirt, to bring him into [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] to visit a bedridden Hagrid, who had been missing him while hospitalised there. They lied to the hospital staff that Fang was a wizard who had been [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] into a dog sent in for treatment, so he could enter, as [[Creature|animals]] were not allowed inside the hospital.

Later that school year, Fang found Mrs Norris trapped in the roots of the [[Hogwarts Whomping Willow]].

[[File:WB F1 Fang HarryMalfoyFangInForest 11428.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Fang in the Forbidden Forest with Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy]]
In 1992, Fang accompanied first-year students [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Harry Potter]] into the [[Forbidden Forest]] for a detention, only to run away in fear after encountering a [[Tom Riddle|hooded figure]] drinking [[Unicorn blood|blood]] from a dead [[unicorn]]. After running away he soon found Hagrid, and [[Hermione Granger]], who immediately knew that Draco and Harry were in danger.

In [[1993]], Fang accompanied [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and Harry to visit [[Aragog]] in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. He, Harry, and Ron were nearly eaten by [[Forbidden Forest Acromantula colony|Aragog's children]], but they were rescued by the wild [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]] that was previously owned by Ron's father, [[Arthur Weasley]].

[[File:B3C14M1 Buckbeak and Fang in Hagrid's Hut.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Fang and Buckbeak inside Hagrid's hut]]
Fang was present when [[Buckbeak]] was being reviewed by the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. He was seen sulking in his basket during one of the trio's many visits to Hagrid's hut during the [[1993–1994 school year]]. Fang also shared the hut with Buckbeak after Hagrid moved the hippogriff inside after [[Lucius Malfoy]] made his case to the [[Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures]] after Buckbeak attacked his son during a [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lesson that resulted in Draco's arm being injured.

In [[1994]], Hagrid decided not to take Fang with him to see the [[Dragon]]s kept in the Forbidden Forest with Harry, as he thought he would not like them.

In [[1995]], when the trio tried to enter Hagrid's hut and Hagrid initialy did not answer due to being upset about [[Rita Skeeter]]'s article about him being a [[half-giant]], Fang barked and scratched at the door when they knocked. [[Albus Dumbledore]] who was with Hagrid let them in and Hagrid explained to them why he was feeling down. Later that year, Fang went with Hagrid in order to look for [[Bartemius Crouch Senior]] in the Forbidden Forest, after [[Viktor Krum]] had been found [[Stunning Spell|stunned]].

===Second Wizarding War===
In [[1996]], after Hagrid had returned to Hogwarts after his [[Mission to the Giant colony]], Fang was with him in the hut when the trio visited him to hear of his tale, and was very happy to see them. Fang also tried to lick [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s face when she entered, but she snapped at him to get away and waved her handbag at him.

When Hagrid was attacked by [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] [[Three Aurors who tried to arrest Rubeus Hagrid|Auror]]s led by Dolores Umbridge, Fang was hit by a [[Stunning Spell]], when he tried to defend Hagrid, resulting in the responsible party being hurled over ten feet away by an enraged Hagrid. Hagrid took the stunned Fang with him when he escaped into the mountains. After [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s return was made public and Umbridge was sacked, Hagrid and Fang returned to their hut at the edge of the Forbidden Forest.

[[File:Halfblood-03201.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Fang next to [[Harry Potter]] after the funeral of Aragog]]
Fang was present during the funeral of Aragog "''sulking in his basket during the burial''" and afterwards, padded across the floor to them and laid his head in Harry Potter's lap and proceeded to slobber all over his robes. Fang was also inside [[Hagrid's Hut]] when it was set ablaze by [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Thorfinn Rowle]], during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] on 30 June, 1997. He was rescued shortly when Hagrid and Harry doused the fire with the [[Water-Making Spell]]. It can be assumed that Fang was present at [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's funeral]] with Hagrid.

In [[1998]], Fang went with Hagrid and [[Grawp]] to Hogwarts to help in the [[Battle of Hogwarts|defense of the castle]]. However, as soon as the fighting began Fang was startled when a vase nearby was hit by a [[spell]] and exploded, and he ran away in fright, with Hagrid going after him immediately. He survived the battle and continued to live with Hagrid in his hut afterwards.

===21st century===
During the [[2009–2010 school year]], he went wild after hearing the songs of uncontrolled [[Fwooper]]s in [[Hagrid's Hut]]. When a [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|student]] encountered him, he showed him some teeth before passing out.

==Physical appearance==
Fang was described as a giant [[boarhound]] with black fur.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|<nowiki/>'Make yerselves at home,' said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.|Fang's friendly personality|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Fang was a large hound who slobbered constantly. On several occasions he completely soaked [[Harry Potter]]'s robes while laying his head on Harry's lap. Fang was a very friendly, affectionate and sociable dog, and was often very happy to see the [[trio]] whenever they came to see Hagrid and him.

[[File:Fang - PAS.png|200px|thumb|right|Fang as seen in {{PAS}}]]
*In the [[Harry Potter (book series)|novels]], Fang is said to be a boarhound, or Great Dane. In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|movies]], Fang is portrayed by a Neapolitan Mastiff, a very different breed, though one that was also used against boars.
*The dogs who play Fang in the first two movies are [[Hugo]], [[Bully]], [[Bella (dog)|Bella]], and [[Vito]]. A dog named [[Luigi]] played Fang in the second and sixth films. In the 2nd disc special feature of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Head Animal Trainer [http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/File:Julie_Tottman_(HP5_Head_Animal_Trainer).JPG Julie Tottman] shows the new dog who played Fang, and its name is [[Monkey (dog)|Monkey]], while in {{HBP|FA}}, the Neapolitan Mastiff who played Fang is [[Uno]].
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Fang is one of the several characters that can dig up Dig-Spots, including [[Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] (Werewolf), [[Mrs Norris]], and [[Crookshanks]]. Without using Freeplay mode or [[Polyjuice Potion]], Fang is playable in the fifth level of ''The Philosopher's Stone'', "The Forbidden Forest", the fifth in ''The Chamber of Secrets'', "Follow The Spiders", and "Dragons" as the second level in ''The Goblet Of Fire''. Fang is unlocked at the beginning of "The Forbidden Forest", by changing from either Ron or Harry (in Story-Mode) to Fang, and then using Fang to dig underneath the cliff at the start. Fang's Character-Token will be in the tunnel.
*In the video game adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix'', Fang is only heard from outside Hagrid's cabin and shakes the whole house.
*Fang's role is omitted from {{DH|F2}}.
*Fang does make a brief appearance in {{POA|FA}}, though he's easy to miss. He can be glimpsed in the background when Hagrid tells the trio to hurry up and head back to the castle before Buckbeak is executed and Harry is reassuring him that it will be okay.
*In {{HM}}, Hagrid asks the player what he should name the dog and says he is a new puppy. The event happens in Chapter 8 of Year Two during the [[1985–1986 school year]]. However, Fang could be found in the game in Year One as well, which was over a year earlier. It makes no sense that Hagrid would say he was a new puppy when he had had him for at least a year, or that Hagrid would have waited that long to name him.
**The player can choose one of three names for Hagrid's dog: Fang, Hagrid Junior, or Voldemort. If the player selects an option other than Fang, Hagrid will laugh them off and pick Fang anyway. The answer decides whether the player was rewarded with Courage, Empathy or Knowledge points.
