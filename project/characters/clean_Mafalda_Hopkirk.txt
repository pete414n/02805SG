'''Madam Mafalda Hopkirk''' (b. [[19 February]]–[[20 March]], in or before [[1973]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and an assistant in the [[Improper Use of Magic Office]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. She issued notices to many of those who violated the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] or the [[Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]]. This included [[Harry Potter]] on two occasions.

Mafalda was still working in the Ministry on [[2 September]], [[1997]]. She was incapacitated and impersonated by [[Hermione Granger]], by way of [[Polyjuice Potion]] during the [[trio]]'s [[Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic]].





By [[1992]], she was working in the [[Improper Use of Magic Office]] of the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. When [[Dobby]] the [[house-elf]] used a [[Hover Charm]], it was Mafalda Hopkirk who sent a notice to [[Harry Potter]] regarding "his" illegal use of [[magic]] at [[4 Privet Drive]] in the presence of [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]. Under the orders of [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]], she sent a notice to Harry expelling him from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] for his use of the [[Patronus Charm]] in front of his cousin [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]], a Muggle. Later that same evening, when cooler heads had prevailed, she sent Harry a notice withdrawing his expulsion and ordering him to attend a [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|hearing]] ten days later.


On [[1 August]], [[1997]] the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], having been infiltrated by the [[Death Eaters]], was [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|taken over]] in a virtually silent coup d'etat. Hopkirk continued to work for the new regime, still as an assistant in the [[Improper Use of Magic Office]]. However, it was acceptable for her to be set aside for record-keeping. A month later, when Hopkirk [[Apparition|Apparated]] to work, she was ambushed by [[Hermione Granger]] and subsequently [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] and locked away. Some of her hair was pulled to use in [[Polyjuice Potion]]. Hermione took the potion and assumed the appearance of Hopkirk in order to [[Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic|gain entry]] to the Ministry. The impostor Hopkirk was used as a stenographer for the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] and helped free the innocent [[Muggle-born]]s.


Mafalda was described as being a "wispy" [[Wizardkind|witch]] with flyaway grey hair. She was also small in stature and wore spectacles. 


Given the courtesy and formality shown in her warning notices, and that Hopkirk's [[Polyjuice Potion]] was described as having a "pleasant heliotrope colour", it is presumed that she was a kind and good-natured witch.

However, she was assumed to be sent by [[Travers]], a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] with pro-[[pure-blood supremacy]] ideals, to keep record for the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. Given her personality as shown on her Polyjuice Potion's colour, it is unlikely that she was a pure-blood supremacist herself. Since Hermione Granger, when disguised as her, became deeply frightened of Dolores Umbridge's and Yaxley's trial on Muggle-borns, but neither of them suspected anything, it can be presumed that she was forced against her own free will in aiding the Ministry of Magic under Voldemort.


*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most accomplished adult wizards and witches, Mafalda was capable of apparating at will. She used apparition to travel to work at the [[British Ministry of Magic]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Mafalda was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], a highly advanced piece of [[magic]] and a mark of superior magical skill.


"Mafalda" is the Portuguese form of Matilda. It means "strength in battle" or "mighty sword", from the Germanic ''macht'' (might; strength) and ''hild'' (battle; sword). This was the name of the wife of [[Wikipedia:William I of England|William the Conqueror]]. In Argentina, "Mafalda" is better known as the name of a comic strip character created by famed cartoonist Quino.



*Hopkirk was voiced by [[Jessica Hynes]] in . She was recast for , instead portrayed by [[Sophie Thompson]].
*In a [[Wizengamot letters on Harry Potter's trial rescheduling|prop letter]] made for  (that went unused in the final film), Mafalda Hopkirk is referred to as the "Commander-in-Chief" of the [[Improper Use of Magic Office]] — whereas  gives her position as "''an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office''".
**It is possible, however, that Hopkirk was indeed head of the office in 1995, but that following the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic]], the Death Eaters recognised her as an effective employee, so rather than taking her life, [[Corban Yaxley]] used his newfound power invested in him to demote her in favour of putting [[Travers]], a fellow Death Eater, in charge of the division upon his appointment to the office of Head of Magical Law Enforcement.
*In the book Mafalda's hair was grey, but in the film it was brown and greying.
