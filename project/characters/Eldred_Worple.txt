{{Dialogue a-b|Worple|[[Harry Potter]], I am simply delighted! I was saying to [[Professor]] [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]] only the other day, ‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?’... But seriously, I would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months... My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea —|Harry|I'm definitely not interested, and I've just seen a friend of mine, sorry.|Eldred Worple trying to convince [[Harry Potter]] to let him write his biography|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
