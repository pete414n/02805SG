'''Vaisey''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and who [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into the [[Slytherin]] house.


He played [[Chaser]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] during the [[1996â€“1997 school year]]. The day before Slytherin's match against Gryffindor, Vaisey was hit in the head by a [[bludger]] and was unable to play.


*In the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film adaptation]], Vaisey is only seen during the [[Quidditch]] match (the first Slytherin who tries to score a goal by hitting the [[Quaffle]] into the hoop).
