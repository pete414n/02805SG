'''Lily J.''' '''Potter''' (née '''Evans''') ([[30 January]], [[1960]]–[[31 October]], [[1981]]) was an [[England|English]] [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the younger daughter of [[Evans sisters' father|Mr]] and [[Evans sisters' mother|Mrs Evans]], and the younger sister of [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia Evans]]. She learned of her [[magic]]al nature as a child, after [[Severus Snape]] recognised her as a witch and told her of the existence of magic. Lily attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1971]]-[[1978]]. She was Sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]] and was a member of the [[Slug Club]]. In her [[seventh year]] she was made [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Girl]] and began dating [[James Potter I|James Potter]].

After Hogwarts, Lily [[Wedding of James Potter I and Lily Evans|married]] James. Along with their friends [[Sirius Black]], [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Peter Pettigrew]], the couple joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]. She and her husband defied [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] himself three times. Shortly afterwards, Lily and James had a son, [[Harry Potter|Harry James Potter]], of whom they made Sirius the godfather. 

However, the family was forced to go into hiding after a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] was made concerning Lord Voldemort and their infant son. It referred to a boy who would be born at the end of [[July]] in [[1980]], who had the power to defeat [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. She and James were betrayed by Pettigrew and were murdered by Voldemort on [[Hallowe'en]] night in 1981, while trying to protect their son.

Lily briefly appeared again through the [[Resurrection Stone]] to encourage Harry in his own sacrifice during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in May 1998. She appeared along with James, Sirius, and Remus. After the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Lily had three grandchildren through her son: [[James Potter II|James Sirius Potter]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus Potter]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]], the last of whom was named in memory of her.




Lily J. Evans was born to [[Evans sisters' father|Mr]] and [[Evans sisters' mother|Mrs Evans]], two [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] of the Evans family, on [[30 January]], [[1960]]. Her family lived in [[Cokeworth]], England. She had an older sister [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]], whom she was quite close to. At the age of nine, Lily became friends with [[Severus Snape]], who lived down in [[Spinner's End]], which was within walking distance of the Evans' house. However, her family was apparently better off, since Petunia sneered at Snape for coming from that poverty-stricken neighbourhood.


Severus was the first person to tell Lily that she was a witch, and he went on to teach Lily a great deal about the [[wizarding world]] while the two eagerly awaited the time when they could attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] together. Lily's [[magic]]al abilities and friendship with Severus caused problems between the Evans sisters. Envying her sister's abilities, Petunia wrote to [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], asking if she could attend Hogwarts with Lily. However, the headmaster kindly refused her petition. The letter was later found by Lily and Severus.

At the age of eleven, Lily bought [[Lily J. Potter's wand|her wand]] from [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]]. The wand was 10¼ inches, willow, "''swishy''", and according to [[Garrick Ollivander]], good for [[Charms (class)|charm work]]. Shortly before her depart to Hogwarts, Lily and Petunia argued about magic again. Her sister called her a "freak" for possess that power and said it was better that she went to that school so "normal people" would be safe.

At the age of eleven, Lily started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she was Sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house. She became quite skilled at [[Potions (class)|Potions]], attracting the attention of [[Professor]] [[Horace Slughorn]], who made her a member of his Slug Club for the students that he considered talented and possibly succesful in the future.

 sees featuring Lily (in fifth year) standing up to James Potter]]
In her fifth year, Lily stood up for her then best friend, Severus Snape, when he was being bullied by [[James Potter I|James Potter]]. Lily attempted to stop his bullying, addressing James only by his surname and vice versa in this moment. It is implied that such bullying had happened more than once. However, Snape lashed out at her in his humiliation, calling her a "''filthy'' ''[[Mudblood]]''." 

He then begged for Lily's forgiveness, but she asked him if he still intended to join the [[Death Eaters]]. When he didn't deny this, Lily realised that Snape wasn't willing to change for her and didn't understand what was wrong with the Death Eaters. This led to a parting of ways between Lily and Snape, as the former had already become dismayed by Snape's fascination with the [[Dark Arts]] and friendship with his Slytherin house-mates [[Mulciber II|Mulciber]] and [[Avery II|Avery]], both of whom were aspiring Death Eaters.

By Lily's fifth year, James had developed a crush on her, but she didn't reciprocate, calling him an "arrogant toerag" because he bullied other students, particularly her best friend. James's best friend, [[Sirius Black]], later commented that James couldn't resist showing off and making a fool of himself whenever she was around.

 towards the end of her education]]
During their seventh year, James matured somewhat, proving himself to be responsible and brave. However, it is implied that he still had the desire to bully Snape, but was willing to stop actually doing it for Lily's sake. This led to her agreeing to go out with him; gaining genuine affection for him in the process. Due to their academic achievement, skill, and responsibility, the young couple eventually were chosen to be [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] and [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Girl]].

In late [[1977]], Lily and James had a disastrous first meeting with Petunia and her then-fiancé, [[Vernon Dursley]], which presumably took place over [[Christmas]] break, as they were both still at Hogwarts. When Vernon tried to impress James with his car, the wizard in turn boasted of his own material wealth, and a row ensued. The evening ended with both Vernon and Petunia storming out of the restaurant and Lily bursting into tears, with an ashamed James promising he'd apologise and make it up (which, due to his and Lily's untimely deaths, never happened). 

Petunia was married by the end of 1977. Lily and James were invited to the wedding, her sister refused to have Lily as a bridesmaid, which upset her deeply. At the reception, Vernon wouldn't talk to James, but described him as "''some magician''" within his earshot.




Marriage
After graduation (at only eighteen years old) James married Lily Evans and Sirius served as their best man at the wedding. It was a quiet ceremony because of the dangers of the [[First Wizarding War]]. Lily's older sister [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] did not attend, for she was highly against Lily being a witch and marrying a wizard. 

It is highly likely that [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Peter Pettigrew]] attended, as they were best friends of James. Both James' parents, [[Fleamont Potter|Fleamont]] and [[Euphemia Potter]] attended the wedding. It's unknown as to whether either of Lily's parents attended as well.

Order of the Phoenix

Living off James' family fortune, the Potters became full-time members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation dedicated to fighting [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]], along with their friends Sirius, [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Peter Pettigrew]]. During the war, Lily and James defied Voldemort on at least three occasions, the first being when they refused to join his cause when he tried to recruit them.

Life in hiding

 shortly after getting married]]
Lily became pregnant in the autumn of 1979. Around the same time, [[Sybill Trelawney]] made a prophecy in front of [[Albus Dumbledore]], predicting that "''the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches''" and would be "''born to those who have thrice defied him''". The first part of the prophecy was overheard by Lily's friend, Snape, who had since become a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. He loyally reported what he had heard to his master, but became horrified when Voldemort came to believe that Lily's son was the subject of the prophecy.  

It was the threat to Lily that led Snape to change sides, warning Dumbledore of the Dark Lord's plans, and vowing to do anything to keep the woman he still loved safe. It was Snape's continuing devotion to Lily, that made Dumbledore certain of his double agent's true loyalties. 


The Potters went into hiding while Lily was still pregnant. The couple also chose Sirius to be their son's godfather. Lily sent a birth announcement to [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]]; it was to be the last piece of information she ever sent her sister, though Petunia would later send Lily a vase for that Christmas. 

In a letter to Sirius dated around Harry's first birthday in [[July]] [[1981]], Lily mentioned that the family had a pet cat and relayed a story about Harry flying on the toy broomstick Sirius had given him as a birthday present, in which she shared a tea with [[Bathilda Bagshot]]. The [[Fidelius Charm]] was placed on their home in [[Godric's Hollow]]. Their [[Secret Keeper|Secret-Keeper]], Peter, was chosen as a less-likely target for the Death Eaters than Sirius, but he betrayed the Potters by telling Voldemort of their whereabouts barely a week later.

Death

]]
On [[Hallowe'en|31 October]], [[1981]] Voldemort entered their home. James told Lily to take Harry and leave while he held him off, although he and his wife were wandless and thus couldn't defend themselves. James was murdered before Lily and Harry could escape the cottage. Trapping mother and son in Harry's nursery, Voldemort, honouring Snape's request to spare her life, offering Lily a chance to step aside. However, she steadfastly refused to stop shielding her son, so Voldemort murdered her.


Because Lily's death was a pure [[Sacrificial protection|loving sacrifice]] (she intended to die and wasn't hoping to save herself, despite having the choice to), Harry was marked with the protection of her [[love]] and Voldemort's [[Killing Curse]] rebounded off the one-year old. The rebounded curse destroyed the Dark Lord's body and temporarily defeated him. Harry was left unscathed, except for a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead. Thus, Harry became known as the "Boy Who Lived", and his fate was sealed.



After Lily and James were murdered, [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] (Lily's sister) was the one to arrange the funeral, as James had no family left. Afterward, she grudgingly cared for her sister's only child.

Harry's first year at Hogwarts

In an attempt to stay hidden from [[Argus Filch]], the school [[Hogwarts Caretaker|caretaker]], Harry stumbled upon the classroom where the mirror was being stored. Upon looking into it, Harry saw his late parents, Lily and James Potter. Over the next few days, Harry proceeded to visit it as often as he could to see [[James and Lily Potter|his parents]]' faces. The Mirror also occupied his thoughts beyond anything else, to the extent that he disregarded Ron's warning that he was growing obsessed with it.

Harry only stopped visiting the mirror after Dumbledore found him one night. Dumbledore found Harry and  explained what the mirror was all about. Dumbledore told him that the mirror was to be moved and requested that Harry not go looking for it. 1992 was the last time Harry saw his parents faces in the mirror. Later, at the end of Harry's [[1991–1992 school year|first year]], [[Rubeus Hagrid]] gave Harry a special [[Harry Potter's photo album|photo album]] containing pictures of his parents.
Dementor attacks
In his third year, whenever Harry encountered a [[Dementor]], he was forced to relive his parents' deaths. The death he was particularly forced to relive was Lily's. This could be due to Harry being in the same room as Lily when she died, while James was murdered in the hallway. Therefore, Harry did not witness nor hear James' death.

Little Hangleton

]]
In Harry's fourth year, Wormtail had placed Voldemort's rudimentary body into a [[cauldron]] containing the nearly finished [[potion]]. He added the first two ingredients: his hand and Harry's blood, as Voldemort believed it would make him stronger and make his enemy touchable. This was because he indirectly received Lily's [[sacrificial protection]]. However, this action also bound Harry's life to Voldemort [[Horcrux|again]] but inversely: Harry couldn't die as long as Voldemort still lived, which ironically meant he couldn't kill the boy.

During Harry's [[Duelling|duel]] with [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] in the [[Little Hangleton]] graveyard, they experienced Priori Incantatem. Shades of his mother and father, and others whom Voldemort had murdered came out of [[Tom Riddle's wand|Voldemort's wand]], encouraging Harry and distracting Voldemort so the younger wizard could escape from the graveyard.

Occlumency
In his fifth year, Harry entered [[Severus Snape]]'s memory of being bullied by James and Sirius via the use of [[Pensieve]], and saw his mother standing up for Snape. He also witnessed Snape calling Lily a Mudblood, which instigated the end of their friendship. This was considered Snape's worst memory.

Resurrection Stone

In 1998, Harry relived that same memory of Snape's, as well as many others containing his mother, in the Pensieve after Snape's death. The memories revealed that she and Snape had been best friends since their childhood and brought to light Snape's unrequited and continuing [[love]] for Lily, years after her death.

]]
Finally, during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], when Harry believed himself to be walking to his own death, he used the Resurrection Stone to bring back the spirits of Lily, James Potter, Sirius, and Remus. Both James and Lily told Harry that they were "''so very proud of him''" for his outstanding courage and strength, and assured him that they would stay with him until the very end. Harry described their very presence as his courage, the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other, with Lily smiling at him and James nodding encouragingly.

After the war
Many years after Lily died, her son married [[Ginevra Weasley]] and fathered three children. Harry's only daughter, [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]], was named in memory of her paternal grandmother.


Lily was a beautiful woman with thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders, and almond-shaped, bright green eyes. Apparently, her eyes were extremely distinctive, because every person who knew Lily would always see them in her son, [[Harry Potter|Harry]]. When the aged Harry travelled back to the past, he commented that even in the face of death, she was still beautiful.



Lily was known for being a vivacious, talented, and popular student. [[Remus Lupin]] once described her as an uncommonly kind person with a habit of seeing the best in others, even when they could not see it themselves.

Lily was a woman of sound moral principles and would stand by them no matter what it cost her, though her actions sometimes were ineffective. On at least one occasion, she called out [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and [[Sirius Black]] for their bullying of her best friend, [[Severus Snape]]. When she realised Snape's devotion to Voldemort's genocidal cause (of which she was a target at the time) and increasingly deep fascination with the [[Dark Arts]], caused her to end her friendship with him permanently.

]]
Though she had a sharp tongue and had no problems in standing up to others when she was in a temper, Lily was still the type of person who would give others a second chance when they had proven themselves worthy of it. The most notable instance of this quality would be how she finally agreed to date James after he had matured out of his bullying ways, despite the fact that she didn't have a good opinion of him during their early school years.

Lily's and her husband's most celebrated virtues were their courage and capacity for self-sacrifice: defying [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] three times as members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and even dying to protect their son [[Harry Potter|Harry]]. It was noted by [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] that Lily was very much like her son, especially in [[Love|strength]]. Her strength is further commented on by her grandson [[Albus Potter|Albus]] in that she would understand her fate and the fact that she would never see her son grow up.


]]

Since even Lord Voldemort was willing to overlook Lily's Muggle-born status and ask her to join him, this is proof that she was a truly powerful and accomplished witch. She was noted for her particular talent in [[Potion|Potion-making]] and was able to conjure a corporeal doe Patronus, a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability.
*'''[[Love]]''': Lily displayed a tremendous amount of love throughout her life. When she was only 21 years old, she lovingly [[Sacrificial protection|sacrificed her own life]] for her only son despite being given the choice to leave him behind and live. It was this very sacrifice that enabled Harry to survive the [[Killing Curse]], which [[counter-charm|rebounded]] off him and destroyed [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s body. It protected her son from her murderer for 16 years after her death, especially due to their [[bond of blood charm|blood connection]].
*'''Control of [[underage magic|Underage Magic]]''': Before attending Hogwarts, Lily already had a level of control over her magic — once she literally flew into the air after jumping off a swing. She then subsequently slowed her descent and lightly land on the ground. She also went on to manipulate a flower to open and close its petals like ''"some bizarre, many-lipped oyster"''.
*'''[[Potion]]s''': According to Slughorn, Lily was an excellent potioneer who impressed him. She had an ''"instinctual understanding"'' of the [[Potions (class)|subject]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Lily excelled in charm-work — her wand was described as being ''"nice for Charms work". '' and effectively conjure a corporeal [[Deer|doe]] [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], which is an incredibly advanced piece of protective magic.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Lily was revealed to have been proficient in transfiguration. When she came home from Hogwarts for the holidays, she ''"[[Teacup to Rat|turned teacups into rats]]". '' She also [[Trans-Species Transformation|transfigured]] a lily petal [[Piscifors|into a fish]], which Slughorn described as "''beautiful magic, wondrous to behold''".
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Along with her husband James, Lily was able to defy and escape Lord Voldemort three times, which showcased her remarkable talent in [[martial magic]].


*'''[[Lily J. Potter's wand|Wand]]''': Lily's wand was 10¼" long, made of [[willow]], and had an unknown [[Wand core|core]]. The wand was described as "swishy" and "''nice for Charms work''" by [[Garrick Ollivander]].
*'''[[Potter cottage|Potters' Cottage]]''': Lily owned this cottage in [[Godric's Hollow]] along with her husband [[James Potter I|James]] during the final weeks of the [[First Wizarding War]]. This is where she and her husband were murdered and her son [[Harry Potter|Harry]] was marked as the "Boy Who Lived". The cottage still stands as a reminder of what happened that [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|Hallowe'en night in 1981]].
*'''[[Potters' cat|Cat]]''': This was a pet of the Potter family. What happened to it after the attack is unknown.



Evans family

Lily had a happy home life and a close relationship with her parents. They were very proud to learn that Lily was a witch and apparently favoured her over her older sister Petunia.

, her older sister]]
Lily initially had a close relationship with Petunia, whom she often played with. When Lily began demonstrating [[magic]]al ability, Petunia was "''torn between curiosity and disapproval''". Her sister was disdainful of the friendship Lily struck up with [[Severus Snape]], the poor wizard who had taken to spying on Lily and informed her that she was a [[Wizardkind|witch]]. In turn, Snape was quite insulting to Petunia for being a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]. When Lily was invited to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Petunia wrote to the headmaster, [[Albus Dumbledore]], requesting that she be permitted to do the same. Although his refusal was kind, Petunia became very bitter and jealously deemed her sister a "freak", even saying that their separation would be better for her safety.


Their relationship seems to have deteriorated greatly and become distant afterward, especially after they dated and eventually married very different men. Despite the bitterness on Petunia's end, the two sisters appeared to still be in contact when Harry was an infant, was said to have "''smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent [Lily] for Christmas''". Petunia also grudgingly took her sister's son, [[Harry Potter|Harry]] in, at Dumbledore's request, after Lily's death. However, even as an adult, Petunia resented that her parents were proud of Lily's magical abilities and took out her enmity on Harry.

James Potter

, her husband and father of her son|left]]
Lily's relationship with [[James Potter I|James Potter]] was initially a volatile one. They first met on the [[Hogwarts Express]] just before the start of their first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], at which time Lily was angered by James' and [[Sirius Black]]'s mockery of her best friend, Severus. Although James was a talented [[Quidditch]] player and well-liked by most, Lily considered him an ''"arrogant bullying toerag"'' and treated him with contempt, mostly for his bad habit of [[hex]]ing innocent students for fun and his hostile relationship with Snape. However, she didn't hate James, admiring how he stood up for his friends and other people who were cruelly treated by aspiring-[[Death Eaters]].

By his fifth year, James started to have romantic feelings for Lily and would show off to try to impress her, without success. It is not known whether he asked her out more than once. It seems that, by that time, James had "''deflated his head a bit''" and "''stopped [[hex]]ing people for the fun of it''". However, it is implied that James still had the desire to bully Snape, but was willing to stop actually doing it for Lily's sake.


By her seventh year, Lily began to give James a chance and eventually grew to fall in love with him as well. The two had similar positions in Hogwarts as [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Girl]] and [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]]. Shortly after their graduation, Lily got [[Wedding of James Potter I and Lily Evans|married]] and joined  [[Order of the Phoenix]] with their friends, fighting at his side several times. They eventually had a child, [[Harry Potter|Harry James Potter]]. Her [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] took the shape of a [[Deer|doe]], while her husband's was a [[Deer|stag]].

Harry Potter


On [[31 July]], [[1980]], Lily and James' first and only child, Harry, was born. They loved their son more than anything, hiding for months so he could survive from the [[prophecy]] concerning his fate with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. On [[Hallowe'en]] in [[1981]] they sacrificed themselves at 21 years old in order to save him from when he was just an infant. [[Albus Dumbledore]] always maintained that the [[love]] his parents had for him (and in return Harry's love for them) was his greatest power. Harry grew to resemble both of his parents greatly, his personality being more similar to Lily's. He also endured mistreatment from Petunia, though much harsher.

Harry barely knew them, but nevertheless regarded them with great reverence and fiercely defended their memory if anyone spoke ill of them. In 1995, he punched [[Draco Malfoy]] for insulting his mother, and he was frequently at odds with [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], who taunted Harry that James was not the great man others made him out to be. An incident that Snape would have delightfully used as an example was witnessed by Harry in the spring of 1996, when Harry accidentally watched James bullying Snape with no provocation (other than the already-existing animosity between them) in one of Snape's own memories, during his [[Occlumency]] lessons. Harry began to question how his mother even came to marry James when she clearly despised him for acting in such a way, though Remus and Sirius later assured Harry that his father had changed his ways, having matured enough to become [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] and eventually win Lily over.

, and grandchildren|left]]
The few times Harry ever saw his parents were in pictures given to him by [[Rubeus Hagrid]], through a vision within the [[Mirror of Erised]], as spectral forms which came out of Voldemort's wand during ''[[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]]'', as stored memories within the Pensieve, and again as spectral forms when he "recalled" them during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], by using the [[Resurrection Stone]]. Lily's spirit was described as looking at Harry as if she couldn't do so enough, and Harry asked his mother to stay close to him as he approached the [[Death Eaters]]' camp and certain doom. Both James and Lily told Harry that they were tremendously proud of him for being so brave and strong despite all the pain and suffering he had endured, and gave him the support he needed to sacrifice himself to Voldemort. Harry later avenged his mother when he killed Voldemort at the end of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

Harry eventually named two of his children after his late parents and godfather, [[James Potter II|James Sirius]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]], whom was named in memory of her. When her youngest grandson, [[Albus (disambiguation)|Albus]], time-traveled to the day before her death he noticed the love in which she placed the blanket over her son and that she clearly treasured and loved her son deeply.



, her once best friend]]
Severus Snape lived near the [[Evans family]] when he was a child and soon began spying on Lily after he noticed that she was a witch. The two became friends when he started telling her about the [[wizarding world]], being excited of attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] together. They were best friends until their fifth year at Hogwarts, despite being sorted into different houses. Similarly, both Lily and Severus were the top students in [[Potion]]s.

However, Lily became increasingly dismayed by Snape's friendships with people such as [[Avery II|Avery]] and [[Mulciber II|Mulciber]], who disdained Muggle-borns and who practised the [[Dark Arts]]. When Snape called Lily a "''filthy [[Mudblood]]''" in a fit of anger and humiliation when she defended him from his bullies (including James and Sirius), it was the last straw for Lily. When she later asked him if he still intended to become a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and he did not deny it, she expressed feeling betrayal and ended their friendship. Rowling revealed in an interview that Lily reciprocated some romantic feelings for Snape, and if he wasn't so involved in the Dark Arts and hadn't become a Death Eater, Lily likely would have pursued him. 


Despite the ending of their friendship, Snape still loved Lily. He had believed that when he joined the Death Eaters, this would impress Lily and she'd want to be with him. When he realised that it was Harry who Voldemort had fixated on as his enemy mentioned in [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|the Prophecy]], Snape begged him to spare Lily's life. However, he showed no concern for the life of her son or husband. Voldemort agreed to this request and offered Lily several chances to step aside. Her refusal to do so even though she had a choice is what created the [[Sacrificial protection|magic that protected Harry]].

The deep [[love]] Snape held for Lily for almost all of his life also influenced his [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], which took the form of a silver doe - the same as hers, caused him to spy on Voldemort for Albus Dumbledore. He also protected her son until his own death, where he told Harry "''Look at me''", wishing to see Lily's eyes once more before he died as it was the only part of Harry that resembled his mother, the rest looking very much like his father. Lily's second grandson, Albus Severus, has both Lily and Harry's eyes and was named in honour of Snape.



 (left to right): Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black, James Potter, and Remus Lupin]]
Lily met [[Sirius Black]] on the [[Hogwarts Express]] at the same time she met James. She disliked them both, as they quickly began teasing Severus, Lily's best friend at the time, though it was Snape who had initiated the argument by mocking the other boys' preference of [[Gryffindor|House]]. When Lily and Sirius were both sorted into Gryffindor House she remembered him from the train and turned her back on him when he made room for her at the Gryffindor table.

Lily eventually married Sirius's best friend. She, Sirius, and the Marauders became members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[First Wizarding War]] and fought in several battles against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. When [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] casted a [[Fidelius Charm]] to hide the Potter family from Voldemort, the couple originally wanted to make Sirius their [[Secret Keeper]], knowing he could be completely and utterly trustworthy. Lily sent him at least one letter written in a cheerfully tone and a photograph of her family during her time in hiding. However, Sirius had proposed that [[Peter Pettigrew]] be made Secret Keeper instead, thinking that Voldemort would not expect a "''weak, talentless thing''" like Peter to be given a such crucial role. This turned out to be a fatal mistake, as Peter had turned traitor and become a spy for the Death Eaters. Barely a week after the Fidelius Charm was performed, Peter betrayed James and Lily to Voldemort, leading to them being tragically murdered.

Sirius was deeply devastated for his friends' death; attacking Peter and attempted to kill him. He was godfather to Lily's son, [[Harry Potter]]. They shared an intimate relationship; Harry regarded Sirius as a mixture of friend and older brother, and Sirius viewed Harry as an exceptionally brave and matured adult with rights to knowing difficult truths, fully capable of shouldering burdens that many wizards much older and wiser than he could not.

Lily's relationship with [[Remus Lupin]] is not known in the books, although they are portrayed as friends in movies. When Snape insisted there was something strange about Remus, Lily answered that she didn't care about what the Marauders did. Most likely, she had also realised that Remus was a [[werewolf]], but didn't care. After graduating from Hogwarts, Remus helped James and Lily hide, and would have willingly died for his friends rather than betray them to save his own skin. When James and Lily died, Remus was devastated and initially believed, along the rest of the [[wizarding world]], that Sirius had been a traitor.

Later on, Remus grew close to Lily's son, Harry Potter. He taught Harry the [[Patronus Charm]] and protected him throughout the [[Second Wizarding War]], while Harry ended up becoming godfather to Remus's son, [[Edward Lupin|Teddy]].


Despite [[Peter Pettigrew]]'s cowardly nature, Lily became more friendly with him as she warmed to James, even affectionately referring to Peter as "''Wormy,''" from his nickname "Wormtail." When James and Lily went into hiding from Lord Voldemort, the couple trusted Peter enough to make him their Secret Keeper, though only at Sirius' suggestion to use someone less obvious than himself for the role. By then, however, Peter had already become a spy for Voldemort and betrayed his dearest friends out of fear for his own life. One time Peter saw Lily and James while they were in hiding, Lily noted that he "''seemed down.''"

After Voldemort murdered Lily and James, it is possible that Pettigrew felt some regret for his treacherous, heartless betrayal. In [[1998]], Pettigrew unintentionally saved Harry from [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], who was trying to kill the boy through Pettigrew's [[Peter Pettigrew's silver hand|silver hand]], by briefly hesitating when Harry reminded him of his [[life debt]]. This one, tiny impulse of mercy, however, led to Pettigrew being killed by the same hand.



, her former professor]]
During her time at Hogwarts, Lily demonstrated extraordinary talent in potions, becoming one of [[Potions Master]] Horace Slughorn's "''all-time favourites''" and a member of his [[Slug Club]]. He considered her to be one of the brightest students he had ever taught (while being known to also teach students like Tom Riddle) and knew her to be a vivacious, charming, talented, if sometimes cheeky girl. Slughorn even stated, "''I don't imagine anyone who met her wouldn't have liked her...very brave...very funny...''", though he was surprised by her Muggle lineage.

In the films, Lily gave Slughorn a present, probably as a token of her respect and love for him as her teacher: a bowl of water, on which a petal from a lily floated, and as the petal sank, it transformed into a fish, just before it reached the bottom. He named the fish [[Francis]]. When Francis suddenly disappeared one day, Slughorn realised that Lily had died. Her death haunted him for many years. Her son Harry used Slughorn's sympathy and grief for his mother's death to his advantage while under the effects of [[Felix Felicis]], persuading Slughorn to give him the true memory of [[Tom Riddle]]'s inquiry about [[Horcrux]]es, by encouraging him to be as brave as his mother was and claimed that it would undo whatever great wrong he had done.


Lily was on close terms with her neighbour and fellow witch [[Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda]], by the time the latter was in her older years and herself in hide with her family. Bathilda was the only one to join the Potters during Harry's birthday tea when he turned one year old, doting her son. Bathilda even spoke to the younger woman on the closeness between Grindelwald and Dumbledore, though Lily remained somewhat sceptical given the strange statement and Bathilda's possible senility.



, her former headmaster|left]]
Albus Dumbledore was Lily's Headmaster when she was a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. When Dumbledore invited Lily to attend Hogwarts, her sister Petunia became jealous and sent a letter to Dumbledore requesting to be enrolled in Hogwarts as well. He answered Petunia that she could not, though in a way Lily found to be "''very kind''". During Lily's years at Hogwarts, Dumbledore became very fond of her, seeing her as a talented witch with a pure, kind heart, and eventually appointing her [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Girl]].

After Lily and her friends graduated from Hogwarts, they became members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation Dumbledore founded and led. When James and Lily became targets of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], Dumbledore offered to be their Secret Keeper in an attempt to protect them, but the role went to [[Peter Pettigrew]] instead, at Sirius' suggestion. This turned out to be the couple's death sentence, as Peter betrayed them to Voldemort, who found them and killed them. 

Dumbledore was deeply upset by their deaths and dedicated the rest of his life to keeping their [[Harry Potter|son]] safe, though he knew [[Death|what]] might be necessary to fulfil the Prophecy. He eventually became Harry's mentor, often telling Harry of the love and goodness of his parents and continually insisting that Harry's love for his parents was his greatest strength and a source of incredible power — "''the power the Dark Lord knows not"''.



, her former head of house and professor]]
Minerva McGonagall was the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] Professor and also the [[Head of Gryffindor House]] while Lily attended Hogwarts. She would have been unable to become Head Girl if she wasn't approved by her Head of House, which implies that McGonagall trusted her. After Lily left Hogwarts, both she and McGonagall became allies of the first [[Order of the Phoenix]] and fought against Voldemort and his [[Death Eaters]].

After Voldemort found and killed the Potters, McGonagall was devastated to learn of Lily and James' death, to which she actually broke down into tears. Professor McGonagall was fond of [[Harry Potter|Lily's son]] and protected him as best as she could throughout his time at Hogwarts.


, her allies|left]]
During the [[First Wizarding War]], Lily was a member of the Order of the Phoenix and  fought alongside many of its members during the First Wizarding War. She appeared to be friendly with some members, such as [[Rubeus Hagrid]], [[Elphias Doge]], and [[Marlene McKinnon]]. She appeared to be very upset when she learned about the [[McKinnon family|McKinnons]]' death, crying all night.

The given name ''Lily'' comes from the name of the flower, which is a symbol of purity. The flowers continue to be representative of purity and [[love]] in Europe. Specifically, the lily is often associated with the Blessed Virgin Mary; one type of the flower is known as the [[Wikipedia:Madonna lily|Madonna lily]]. Greek mythology also links lilies to the Muses and to the goddess Hera. In China, lily means "forever in love" and were thought to be capable of averting evil.

Lily's maiden name was Evans. "''Evans"'' is a Welsh or English surname derived from the given name "''Evan"''. As a Welsh name, [[Wikipedia:Evan|Evan]] means "young warrior". Interestingly, this could have been foreshadowing the birth of her son, Harry, who was described as a "young warrior". Lily herself was also a young warrior, having fought in the First Wizarding War at age 21. "Evan" can also be considered a form of the name ''John'', (named after the apostle John), meaning "God is gracious and merciful". Her surname was inspired by a famous writer Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under pseudonym . 

Lily's married surname is Potter. It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. [[Wikipedia:Potter|Potter]] is a very common surname of English origin. J.K Rowling has also commented that she has liked this name since childhood, due to a relationship with two friends who were named Ian and Vikki Potter. [[Wikipedia:Beatrix Potter|Beatrix Potter]] was a well-known English children's author, which might be a reference to Rowling. [[Wikipedia:Potter's Field|Potter's Field]] is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans." It is first mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew, the Potter family had many members that fit that description. The [[Wikipedia:Potter Box|Potter Box]] is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University.

) in LEGO form]]
*In the films, [[Geraldine Somerville]] plays Lily as an adult, [[Susie Shinner]] plays her as a teenager, and [[Ellie Darcey-Alden]] plays an even younger Lily in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|film adaptations]] of  and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptions. J.K. Rowling was asked to play Lily in the [[Mirror of Erised]] scene in , but she refused the part because she said that she was "not cut out to be an actress because she'd mess-up somehow."
*Technically, [[Geraldine Somerville]] is one of just over a dozen actors and actresses to have appeared in all eight Harry Potter films and played the same character, one of only three adult actors to do so (the others being [[Robbie Coltrane]] and [[Alan Rickman]]). However, several films do not feature new footage of her and are simply short clips from other films.
*[[Ellie Darcey-Alden]] who plays young Lily Potter in , actually has brown eyes, unlike how Lily's eyes are described, [[Daniel Radcliffe]]'s eyes or [[Geraldine Somerville]]'s eyes.
*Lily is portrayed by British actress Annabel Baldwin (alternating the role of Moaning Myrtle as well) in the original West End production of .
*[[Susie Shinner]] did not appear as Lily in the "Snape's Worst Memory" segment of , although a promotional image showed her in costume.
*In the Harry Potter novels, Lily is mentioned to have died aged twenty-one, yet in the films she appears much older. This could be that she is seen with Harry in the mirror at the age she would be at the time, had she been alive (31), though this doesn't make sense as she still appears to be older than 21 in memory-flashbacks, photographs and during the Priori Incantatem scene. So it's most likely that just like [[Severus Snape]] in the films (the character is in his 30s, Alan Rickman is in his 50s-60s) the character herself is still in her 20s. However she merely looks like she is in her early 30s.
*In the novels it is often mentioned that Lily had bright green eyes and that Harry had the same eyes. In the films it is often remarked that Harry has his mother's eyes, but it is never stated what colour they are. Also in the films, Harry has blue eyes and young Lily has brown eyes.
*Lily's initially negative opinion of James is not shown in the films, and the purely strong and close romantic attraction between them seemed to develop much sooner.
*In , [[Remus Lupin]] mentions that Lily had been there for him at a time when no one else was. This statement may or may not be canon, as the books never imply that Lily knew Lupin well until after she started dating James.
*In , Voldemort taunts Harry by calling Lily "your filthy [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] mother" rather than "[[Mudblood]]", even though she's a [[Muggle-born]] witch. Note that in , the [[Tom Riddle]] coming out of his [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|diary]] uses the term Mudblood. Although, it should be noted that Voldemort, believing in total blood purity, wouldn't care for technicalities and likely considered Muggle-borns as "bad" as Muggles themselves.
*In , there is an additional sequence after [[Aragog]]'s [[Funeral of Aragog|funeral]] where [[Horace Slughorn]] describes a gift given to him by Harry's mother, Lily. One day, he'd found a bowl in his office with a small amount of water in it, upon which floated a single petal from a lily. As he watched, the petal sank into the water, and just before it reached the bottom, it transformed into a fish. Slughorn was delighted by what he considered a beautiful piece of magic, and kept the fish for many years, naming it [[Francis]]. On the night of [[31 October]], [[1981]], the night Lily Potter died, Francis disappeared from his bowl, and Slughorn knew right then and there what had happened to Lily.
*In the films, particularly  and , Lily has a habit of calling Harry "sweetheart".
*In European folklore and in the infamous treatise on witchcraft, '''', the combination of dark red hair and bright green eyes was considered the mark of a witch, thus it is notable that Lily Evans possesses this exact colouring.
*Lily's name continues a pattern of flower names in the series. For instance, in the generation during the First Wizarding War, there was her and [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia Evans]]. A lily and a petunia are both flowers. In the generation of the Second Wizarding War there was [[Narcissa Malfoy]], [[Pansy Parkinson]], [[Fleur Delacour]], [[Poppy Pomfrey]] and [[Lavender Brown]], and, although likely just a coincidence, [[Hannah Abbott]]'s first name sounds almost identical to the Japanese word for flower, "Hana" (花). In the generation after the war there was Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger's daughter, [[Rose Granger-Weasley]]. There was also Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley's daughter, [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]].
*Lily Evans' life bears some resemblances to that of the character Lilias Craven in Marsha Norman's [[Wikipedia:The Secret Garden (musical)|stage musical adaptation]] of Francis Hodgson Burnett's novel '''', having died prematurely, been part of an unrequited love triangle, and having passed her eyes on to a young relative.
*Other than [[Minerva McGonagall]], Lily is the only known [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Girl]]. It can however be assumed that, like prefects, one head girl is chosen out of the 7th years every year by the headmaster.
*Rubeus Hagrid revealed that Lord Voldemort tried to recruit James Potter and Lily Evans before they left Hogwarts. While this is understandable for James, it was revealed by Rowling that Muggle-borns such as Lily ''can'' be permitted to join the Death Eaters, but only in extremely rare circumstances.
*When asked if Lily knew the effect she would have standing in front of Harry, J. K. Rowling stated in an interview; "''No - because as I've tried to make clear in the series, it never happened before. No one ever survived before. And no one, therefore, knew that could happen.''" Additionally, when asked if Voldemort or anyone else using the [[Killing Curse]] ever gave someone a choice, and they took the option to die, she said "''They may have been given a choice, but not in that particular way.''"
*Though Harry bears a great resemblance to his father, it is often noted that he has Lily's bright green eyes. In a , Rowling stated, "''Harry has his father's and mother's good looks. But he has his mother's eyes and that's very important in a future book''". That future book was . In Snape's death scene in that novel, after having passed on his memories to Harry, he whispers to Harry: "Look... at... me..." In one of Snape's memories, it is revealed that Dumbledore persuades Snape to protect Harry after Lily's death by mentioning the fact that he has "precisely" the same eyes as his mother. His last words to Harry were simply a desire to see Lily's eyes before he died.
*Lily and [[Order of the Phoenix]] member, [[Nymphadora Tonks]], are very similar. They both are related to Muggles (Lily's parents and Nymphadora's paternal grandparents), They both married a Marauder (Lily married James, and Nymphadora married Remus Lupin) and have one son (Harry Potter and [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]]) who was only a baby when his parents died fighting Dark forces. Both sons have inherited something from their mothers: Harry his mother's eyes, Teddy his mother's Metamorphmagus abilities.
*Lily and her daughter-in-law Ginny also are very very similar to each other. They both have red hair, they both were popular in school, both weren't afraid to stand up for their friends (Lily when the Marauders harassed Severus Snape, and Ginny when people ridiculed Luna Lovegood by calling her Loony Lovegood) and they both married a Potter: Lily married James; Ginny married Harry.
*Lily and her grandson [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus Potter]] are also very similar. They are both the second born child of their families. Albus inherit her bright green eyes through her son Harry who also has her green eyes. Both have been antagonised by their older sibling, Petunia was jealous of her magical abilities and called her a freak, Albus is picked on by his brother James.
*So far, Lily is the only named muggle-born in canon who was offered to join the Death Eaters, which is known to be rare.
*Lily and her husband are one of two pairs of relatives killed by Voldemort. The second is that composed by [[Gellert Grindelwald]] and [[Bathilda Bagshot]]. However, unlike the latter, they were killed on the same day.
