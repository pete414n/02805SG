{{Quote|Obviously, she is feeling very sad, because of [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] dying. Then I expect she's feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can't work out who [''sic''] she likes best. Then she'll be feeling guilty, thinking it's an insult to Cedric's memory to be kissing Harry at all... And she probably can't work out what her feelings are towards Harry anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that's all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she's afraid she's going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she's been flying so badly.|Cho's grief, confusion, and guilt|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Cho Chang''' (b. [[1978]]/[[1979]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1990]]-[[1997]] and was sorted into [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]]. She was a [[Seeker]] for the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]] and a popular student. She was also one year ahead of the famous Harry Potter.

In Cho's [[fifth year]], she began dating [[Cedric Diggory]] while he was a Champion in the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Unfortunately, Cedric became one of the first casualties of the [[Second Wizarding War]], when he was murdered by [[Peter Pettigrew]] on [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s order in June of [[1995]]. His death greatly upset Cho and made her determined to fight against the recently returned [[Dark Wizard|Dark Lord]].

In her sixth year, against her parents' wishes, she joined [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]]. In the same year she also began a romantic relationship with Harry. However, Cho's best friend [[Marietta Edgecombe]] betrayed the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]]. After her friend's betrayal, Cho and Harry's relationship fell apart. She remained loyal to her school and to the D.A., returning after she had graduated to participate in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

Cho survived the [[Second Wizarding War]] and eventually married [[Cho Chang's spouse|a Muggle]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Cho was born into a wizarding [[Chang family|family]],<ref name="blood status" /> the daughter of [[Cho Chang's father|Mr]]. and [[Cho Chang's mother|Mrs Chang]] between September [[1978]] and August [[1979]]. She became a great [[Quidditch]] fan at the age of six, and cheered for the [[Tutshill Tornados]].

===Hogwarts years {{C|1990–1997}}===
====Early years====
In [[1990]], at the age of eleven, Cho began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was Sorted into [[Ravenclaw]] house. She soon tried out for her [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team|house Quidditch team]], and attained the position of [[Seeker]]. She became friends with fellow Ravenclaw [[Marietta Edgecombe]].

====Fourth year====
{{Quote|Their seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team.|Harry Potter seeing Cho for the first time|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Cho.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Cho Chang and an owl at Hogwarts]]
During a [[Gryffindor]]-[[Ravenclaw]] [[Quidditch]] match in her fourth year, Cho first met [[Harry Potter]], who was a year below her and a fellow [[Seeker]]. Harry noticed she was very pretty and she made his stomach "''feel funny''". Cho's impression of Harry was favourable, and when she later wished Harry good luck before Gryffindor had a Quidditch match against [[Slytherin]], Harry went bright red.

During the match against Ravenclaw, Cho began to tail Harry rather than find the [[Golden Snitch]] herself. Harry soon caught on to her strategy and attempted to trick her into thinking he had spotted the Snitch. As he dove, he saw the Snitch for real. Cho then gasped at the sight of a trio of [[Dementor]]s.

Harry managed to unleash a powerful [[Patronus Charm]] as well as snag the Snitch; the dementors were actually: [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Vincent Crabbe]], [[Gregory Goyle]], and [[Marcus Flint]] in disguise. Ravenclaw did not win the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] that year with Gryffindor winning it instead of Slytherin.<ref name="POA">{{POA}}</ref>

====Fifth year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|D'you — d'you want to go to the ball with me?|Cho Chang|Oh! Oh Harry, I'm really sorry, I've already said I'll go with someone else.|Harry asks Cho to the [[Yule Ball]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Cho and Fleur.jpg|250px|thumb|Cho sitting next to [[Fleur Delacour]] after the arrival of [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]]]]
On [[25 August]] [[1994]], Cho went to the [[Quidditch World Cup]] [[1994 Quidditch World Cup#Finals|Finals]], presumably with her family. While there, she exchanged greetings with [[Harry Potter]], who had a crush on Cho by this time, having been developing feelings for her since the previous year when he first saw her during a [[Quidditch]] match against the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]]. He considered her to be very pretty and a good [[Seeker]].

She was friendly towards Harry throughout the year, but probably did not return his romantic feelings. She had already accepted [[Cedric Diggory]]'s request to be his date to the Yule Ball. Cedric was a year above Cho and a champion in the [[Triwizard Tournament]].

[[File:Yule ball5.gif|250px|thumb|left|Cho and Cedric dancing at the Yule Ball]]
Despite this, Cho refused to treat Harry poorly, as the majority of the school did because the [[Goblet of Fire]] had also selected him; she refused to wear one of [[Draco Malfoy]]'s ''Support Cedric Diggory'' badges, something Harry was grateful for. He asked Cho to attend the [[Yule Ball]] with him, and she let him down kindly, even apologising for being unable to accept his offer; he still spent most of the ball watching Cho, who either soon began or was already dating Cedric. She was the <nowiki>'</nowiki>''thing''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Cedric would miss most and thus became his hostage during the [[Triwizard Tournament#Second Task|Second Task]] of the Tournament; he employed the [[Bubble-Head Charm]] to save her from [[Great Lake|Hogwarts' lake]].<ref name="GOF">{{GOF}}</ref>

That June, Cedric was murdered by [[Peter Pettigrew]] on [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s orders. Cho was devastated and openly cried at the memorial service at the end of the school year.

====Sixth year====
{{Dialogue|Harry Potter|Look, let's not talk about [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] right now... let's talk about something else.|Cho Chang|I thought, I thought you'd u-u-understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n-need to talk about it too! I mean, you saw it happen, d-didn't you?|Cho's need for closure in regards to Cedric's death|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Cedric's death made Cho believe Harry's claim that Voldemort had returned despite the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' branding him a liar or insane. She sought Harry out several times and attempted to engage him in conversation, probably motivated by both a desire to learn the circumstances of Cedric's death and a growing fondness for Harry. Unfortunately for Harry, these encounters did not go well. The first time Cho found him covered with [[Stinksap]] that was accidentally let off by [[Neville Longbottom]]'s [[Mimbulus mimbletonia]]. The second time, she ended up arguing with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] about Quidditch teams. On the third try, when Cho entered the [[Owlery]] to send a letter to her mother for her birthday while Harry was there, she defended him from a suspicious [[Argus Filch]].<ref name="OOTP"/>

[[File:ChoWithHarryCastingSpell.jpg|250px|thumb|Cho training with [[Dumbledore's Army]]]]
When invited by [[Hermione Granger]] to join Dumbledore's Army, Cho went against the advice of her parents, who wished her to remain on [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s good side, as her mother worked at the Ministry. She also brought her best friend and fellow Ravenclaw [[Marietta Edgecombe]] along, despite the other girl's reluctance to join due to her mum's position at the Ministry as well. Cho joined because she was determined to fight against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]] after what happened to Cedric in the previous year.<ref name="OOTP"/>

However, as a D.A. student she had her ups and downs. At first, she got nervous and performed her spells poorly whenever Harry was nearby. This indicated that her romantic feelings for him had grown since the previous year. Later, though, she was able to conjure a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] in the shape of a [[swan]]. However, she did have some trouble with a [[Disarming Charm]], saying ''Expellimellius'' instead of the actual incantation, causing Marietta's sleeve to catch on fire. She also mentioned that she had never been able to stun anything before Harry taught her and commented that he was a good teacher.<ref name="OOTP"/>

[[File:Harry and Cho kiss.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The kiss between Cho and Harry]]
Cho initiated a kiss with Harry under some [[mistletoe]] shortly before [[Christmas]] after a D.A. session. However, she soon ended up in tears, confused and guilty because of her conflicting feelings for Harry and Cedric. This kiss was something that Harry did not enjoy much and described as being "''wet''", because of all the tears and a repeat kiss did not happen. Despite this, she and Harry went on a date in the wizarding village of [[Hogsmeade]] on [[Valentine's Day#1996|Valentine's Day]] where the couple sent their time at [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]]. The tea shop made Harry uncomfortable, as it reminded him of Umbridge's too pink office.<ref name="OOTP"/>

[[File:Harry And Cho PM Valentines In Madam Puddifoots.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Harry and Cho on a date inside [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]]]]
Cho's continuing grief over Cedric's death, her ill-founded jealousy over Harry's friendship with [[Hermione Granger]] (who, ironically, tried to advise Harry on how to handle girls), and Harry's overall inexperience with girls soured the experience. Cho became jealous when Harry mentioned his plans to meet Hermione later in the day, and she tried to gauge Harry's feelings for her by mentioning that [[Roger Davies]] had asked her out, but this only bewildered Harry. She ended up in tears after Harry refused to discuss Cedric's death with her.<ref name="OOTP"/>

Later in the year, Cho's friend Marietta betrayed the D.A. to Umbridge, and, as a result, was afflicted by the [[Dumbledore's Army parchment jinx|jinx]] performed by Hermione on the [[Dumbledore's Army parchment|piece of parchment]], signed earlier by all members of the D.A. The hex made purple pustules spell <nowiki>'</nowiki>''SNEAK''<nowiki>'</nowiki> across her face that could not be removed, something Cho considered a <nowiki>'</nowiki>''horrible trick''<nowiki>'</nowiki>. When Harry scorned Marietta for the betrayal and Cho defended her, their relationship went downhill.<ref name="OOTP">{{OOTP}}</ref>

====Seventh year====
{{Dialogue|Ron Weasley|Michael — but — But you were going out with him!|Ginny Weasley|Not anymore. He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.|Harry, Ron, and Ginny discussing Cho dating [[Michael Corner]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
At the beginning of her seventh and final year at Hogwarts, Cho caught a glimpse of Harry on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. She did not speak with him, instead hiding back in her compartment with [[Marietta Edgecombe]]. Harry commented that she was the only one not staring at him, he also noticed that her friend Marietta still had the word SNEAK written in pimples on her face.<ref name="HBP"/>

[[File:Students at the base of the tower.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Cho and others standing at the base of the Astronomy Tower after Dumbledore's death]]
Harry and Cho had almost no interaction for the rest of the year; according to Harry, they simply <nowiki>'</nowiki>''fell apart''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, too embarrassed to even look at one another.<ref name="HBP">{{HBP}}</ref> That year Harry began dating [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], while Cho dated [[Michael Corner]],<ref name="OOTP" /> who coincidentally had previously dated Ginny and had then offered Cho comfort after their sixth year Quidditch House Cup loss.

Cho did not participate in the battle that took place inside the castle after Death Eaters successfully infiltrated the Hogwarts, as she did not keep her D.A. coin on her person at all times. Cho was also present in the courtyard after [[Albus Dumbledore]] died. She and the rest of the students raised their wands as a farewell to their former [[headmaster]]. It is possible that Cho attended [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's funeral]] with her parents, seeing as she was a Dumbledore supporter and was most likely saddened by his death.<ref name="HBP"/>

===After Hogwarts {{C|1997–}}===
====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
{{Dialogue|Cho Chang|If you'd like to see what the [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|diadem]]'s supposed to look like, I could take you up to our common room and show you, Harry. Ravenclaw's wearing it in her statue.|Ginny Weasley|No, [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]] will take Harry, won't you, Luna?|Cho offers to help Harry during the Battle of Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:DA 1998.jpg|250px|thumb|D.A. members in [[1998]]]]
When Hogwarts was attacked, Cho demonstrated her loyalty by reuniting with other members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] and joining the final battle against Voldemort and the [[Death Eaters]]. She appeared amicable and friendly with Harry. She offered to lead him to the [[Ravenclaw Tower|Ravenclaw Common Room]] in search of [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]'s diadem. However, in an unwarranted act of jealousy, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] recommended [[Luna Lovegood]] to accompany Harry in Cho's place.

[[File:Padma Leanne Katie Cho.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Cho with [[Katie Bell]], [[Leanne]], and [[Padma Patil]] in the Great Hall after the Battle of Hogwarts]]
Cho was present when Lord Voldemort falsely announced that Harry was dead. During the second stage of the battle Cho and the other defenders of Hogwarts were pushed back into the Great Hall. She witnessed Harry Potter's final defeat Lord Voldemort, thus ending the Second Wizarding War. After the battle, Cho reunited with her freinds. She was seen sitting with [[Katie Bell]], [[Leanne]], and [[Padma Patil]] in the aftermath of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Voldemort's Last Stand|defeat]].<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

====Marriage====
After the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Cho later married a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Cho Chang's spouse|individual]].<ref>[http://blog.nola.com/living/2007/10/new_orleans_students_give_rowl.html J.K. Rowling New Orleans book tour report]</ref> She most likely kept her [[Dumbledore's Army coin|D.A. coin]], as a badge of honour, as did other D.A. members. It can be assumed that she attended the [[2014]] reunion of Dumbledore's Army.

==Physical appearance==
Cho was described to be an extremely pretty girl with long, shiny dark hair, a freckled nose, and being a head shorter than [[Harry Potter]]. For her date with Harry, she tied her hair back into a ponytail, to which he described as very pretty. Because of her beauty, she attracted a considerable amount of male attention during her Hogwarts years, most notably: [[Cedric Diggory]], [[Roger Davies]], [[Michael Corner]], and of course Harry.

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b|Ron Weasley|You're well out of it, mate. I mean, she's quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.|Harry Potter|She's probably cheerful enough with someone else.|Ron Weasley and Harry Potter discussing Cho|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Katie Leung as Cho Chang (GoF-promo-06).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cho in her fifth year]]
Generally polite, sweet, and well-mannered, Cho was easy to get along with and was a popular student at Hogwarts, with a large group of friends and many boys who admired her for her extreme beauty (including Harry Potter himself).

Having been sorted into [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]], Cho was presumably intelligent, enforced by her mastery of all [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|defence magic]] that Harry taught her, including the Patronus Charm, though she did admit that she was unable to stun anything before Harry taught her. She was also an avid [[Quidditch]] fan (having supported the [[Tutshill Tornados]] since she was six years old) and a good athlete, playing [[Seeker]] for her House's team.

She was also loyal and brave, having been loyal to the Tutshill Tornados for many years as opposed to jumping the bandwagon, joining [[Dumbledore's Army]] in defiance with the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] both out of support of Harry and in order to avenge the death of her late boyfriend [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]], sticking up for her friend [[Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta]] when the rest of the group ousted her for her treachery, and returning to Hogwarts in her [[seventh year]] in order to fight alongside her comrades and defend the school from Death Eaters.

For the most part, Cho was often found around Hogwarts with a gaggle of girlfriends, though after one of her emotional breakdowns over Cedric's death, they apparently left her during her depression. Despite this, Cho was a very loyal person (perhaps even to a fault); when she and her friend [[Marietta Edgecombe]] joined Dumbledore's Army, she insisted on bringing her friend along even when her friend expressed disinterest and cynicism to the club's effects.

Later, even though Marietta eventually sold out the DA to Umbridge and the Ministry of Magic, Cho stood by her and insisted to the accusatory Harry that Marietta was a 'lovely person' who 'just made a mistake'. Her loyalty and courage were shown again when she came back to Hogwarts to fight even after she had graduated, and offered to show Harry up to the [[Ravenclaw Tower]], indicating that she harboured no hard feelings against them despite their previously fallen out romantic relationship.

Cho was perceived by [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] to be excessively emotional, though as Hermione stated, much of this characterisation was attributed to her behaviour and actions directly after her boyfriend's death, pushing her way through the trauma and grief that is only observed from the periphery. During her grief, she was prone to many crying spells and a difficult control over her emotions, leading to a prying sort of aggression when she dated Harry to get the details of Cedric's death.

Cho also felt irrational jealousy and paranoia when Harry would bring up [[Hermione Granger]] for what Cho saw to be flippant insensitivity from Harry's end. Hermione, for her part, did not seem to blame Cho at all, understanding her grief and depression and stating that it had interfered with many aspects of Cho's life, including Cho's grades and her position on the Quidditch team.

Cho has also said that she and Roger Davies used to date; after Ravenclaw's loss of the House Cup in 1995, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] said that Michael Corner had gone to comfort Cho. Later in life, she married a Muggle.

==Magical abilities and skills==
[[File:Patronus Swan2.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Cho's corporeal swan [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]]]
{{Quote|She's a fourth year, and she's good....|Cho's talent at flying|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Cho flew excellently, so much so that she was chosen to play the position of [[Seeker]] on the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]].<ref name="POA"/> However, Cho's flying skills suffered intensely due to her grief over Cedric's death, to the extent where she was actually afraid she would lose her position on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.<ref name="OOTP"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Cho appeared to be proficient in charm-work, given how in [[1996]] she learned how to successfully conjure a fully corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] in her sixth year, which is a very advanced piece of [[magic]] and a sign of superior magical ability and talent. Her Patronus took the form of a [[swan]].<ref name="OOTP">{{OOTP}}</ref>
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Considering she trained with the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]], Cho would have been capable in defensive and offensive magic. However, her track-record with defensive learning spells was uneven, as she struggled to learn the [[Disarming Charm]] effectively.<ref name="OOTP"/> She seemed to have improved her abilities based on her fighting in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Death Eaters]] in [[1998]], and surviving both the battle and the [[Second Wizarding War]] (assuming her survival had not just been owing to simple good luck of course).<ref name="DH"/>

==Possessions==
[[File:Cho chang's wand.jpg|150px|thumb|Cho's wand]]
*'''[[Cho Chang's wand|Wand]]''': Cho's wand was of unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. Like most [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] in [[Great Britain]], she most likely purchased it at the age of eleven from [[Garrick Ollivander]] before beginning her education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in 1990.
*'''[[Cho Chang's dress robes|Dress robes]]''': Cho wore silver East Asian-style robes to the [[Yule Ball]] in 1994, which she attended with Cedric Diggory.
{{Quote|It means they're not real fans, they're just jumping on the bandwagon —|Ron regarding Cho's badge|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
*'''[[Tornados badge]]''': Cho Chang was a great fan of the Tornados Quidditch team and showed her support by owning and wearing one of their badges.
*'''[[Comet 260]]''': Cho owned this model of broom and used it while on the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]]. She was seen riding it in her match against [[Harry Potter]] in 1994.

==Relationships==
===Family===
Cho's relationship with her parents was unknown, but it was revealed that, during the [[1995–1996 school year]], both her [[Cho Chang's mother|mother]] and [[Cho Chang's father|father]] wanted her to stay on [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s good side. Though Cho went against their wishes by joining [[Dumbledore's Army]], she did send her mother a [[Cho Chang's letter to her mother|parcel]] for her birthday, showing affectionate care. Their relationship after the school year was unknown.

===Roger Davies===
[[File:Roger Davies.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Roger Davies]], her ex-boyfriend]]
Some time during Cho's life, she dated a fellow [[Ravenclaw]] — [[Roger Davies]], who also served as her [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] on [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team|their house's Quidditch team]] — but it didn't last long since he eventually got [[Roger Davies's girlfriend|a new girlfriend]] while Cho moved on with either Cedric or Harry. Davies asked Cho out sometime after Cedric's death, though Cho rejected him in favour for Harry; regardless, she used this to gauge Harry's feelings for her, and looked at Roger and his girlfriend as though they were setting a standard to which Cho expected Harry to live up.

===Cedric Diggory===
[[File:Cedric Diggory Profile.png|200px|thumb|[[Cedric Diggory]], her late boyfriend]]
In her [[fifth year]], Cho was asked to the [[Yule Ball]] by Cedric Diggory, a [[Hufflepuff]] student a year above her; the two began dating as late as after this. Because Cho was the person Cedric would miss most, she served as his hostage during the Second Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name="GOF" /> Cho and Cedric also had a date at [[Puddifoot|Madam Puddifoot]]'s [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop|Tea Shop]]. Cho was devastated when Cedric was murdered that June.

The following year was very difficult for her; in addition to missing Cedric, she was the subject of gossip regarding her burgeoning romance with [[Harry Potter]], the only witness to Cedric's murder who was widely regarded as being either a liar or a nutter for claiming that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned. Cho's grief and depression led her to almost constantly crying and causing her Quidditch abilities to suffer.<ref name="OOTP" /> This was probably compounded by a lack of closure, as Harry was the only person who knew what had happened to Cedric and did not want to discuss it with Cho.

Given how, in spite of her genuinely intense grief, Cho managed to go on to date others, and eventually married a Muggle after the Second Wizarding War, it can be said that she learned to move on from the pain of losing Cedric.

===Harry Potter===
{{Dialogue a-b|Ron Weasley |You haven't ever chucked anyone, have you? You and Cho just —|Harry Potter|Sort of fell apart, yeah.|Harry Potter and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] on the end of the former's romance with Cho|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Harry Potter movies hbp promostills 6.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]], her ex-boyfriend]]
Harry Potter was drawn to Cho's good looks and developed a crush on her when she was in her fourth year,<ref name="POA" /> and asked her to the Yule Ball in the next, though she had already agreed to attend with Cedric. Still, Cho treated Harry kindly, such as in refusing to wear a [[Potter Stinks badge|''Potter Stinks''/''Support Cedric Diggory!'' badge]] during the [[Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name="GOF" />

In her sixth year, Cho began to return Harry's feelings, though she felt somewhat guilty for doing so, considering the recent murder of [[Cedric Diggory]]. She joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and became nervous whenever Harry was nearby, something Harry also exhibited. They shared a kiss under the mistletoe around Christmas, but this was spoiled by Cho beginning to cry, and Harry being at a loss for how to respond.

The two went on a date in [[Hogsmeade]] on Valentine's Day, but Cho's feelings for Harry were confused because of her continuing grief over Cedric's death and Harry's discomfort with discussing it. She also became jealous of Harry's friendship with [[Hermione Granger]], convinced they had feelings for each-other, and in a moment of weakness and insecurity, ditched the date. Harry, who was inexperienced with girls, found Cho's behaviour very confusing, especially when she tried to make him jealous and to gauge his feelings for her by mentioning that [[Roger Davies]] had asked her out, and ultimately leaving him in [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]] for the other customers to stare at him astonishingly.

[[File:Cho-chang-kiss.gif|250px|thumb|Cho and Harry kissing under some mistletoe]]
Unimpressed with her attitude and for souring his experience of a first date, Harry grew angry at her. Though they eased up a bit after Cho read Harry's interview in ''[[The Quibbler]]'', the strike that broke the relationship was when [[Marietta Edgecombe]] betrayed the D.A. and Cho stood up for her, angering Harry, who in turn again became angry with Harry and paranoid that he and Hermione were in a relationship.<ref name="OOTP" /> After that, their relationship simply 'fell apart'.<ref name="HBP" />

When Cho saw Harry on the [[Hogwarts Express]] at the end of the 1995–1996 school year, and again at the start of the 1996-1997 school year, she avoided him both times, as she was too embarrassed (and possibly still angry), for them to look at each other, let alone talk to each other.<ref name="OOTP" /><ref name="HBP" /> On the other hand, Harry found himself not caring about Cho anymore due to his godfather [[Sirius Black]]'s death being far more devastating to him than their break-up,<ref name="OOTP" /> seemingly disregarding Cho with indifference as opposed to embarrassment. As for Marietta, he sneered at her limited success of hiding her disfigurement.<ref name="HBP" />

However, by 1998, any negative feelings on Cho's part seemed to have vanished, as she offered to escort Harry to [[Ravenclaw Tower]] just before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. She was disappointed when [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] fiercely suggested that [[Luna Lovegood]] escort him instead, suggesting that Cho may have appreciated some alone time with Harry, whether because of any lingering feelings or just because she would've liked to talk with him since after their fallout. Harry, on the other hand, did not so much as hesitate in accepting Ginny's suggestion and Luna's escort, indicating that he was still angry and/or indifferent towards her and had no interest in mending their relationship (though it is also possible that the then tense and desperate situation with Voldemort and his forces left Harry with little time or emotional energy to devote to Cho).<ref name="DH" />

{{Quote|Women! What did she want to talk about Cedric for, anyway? Why does she want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe?|Harry angry at Cho's constant crying|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
One of the reasons for Harry's attraction to Ginny was due to her being rarely weepy when she was upset.<ref name="DH" /> This contrasts with Cho, whose depression after her boyfriend's death led to her crying frequently, which Harry did not know how to handle. Harry had always envisioned that any time they spent together would involve Cho enjoying herself, not crying on his shoulder, showing that he had little desire in spending time comforting her to begin with. Eventually, Harry implied that Cho's depression and crying were things that he had to 'cope' with, leading her to storming away due to this insensitivity.<ref name="OOTP" />

At the end of her [[1996|sixth year]], after the end of her relationship with Harry, Cho began dating Michael Corner, a [[Ravenclaw]] student a year below her. Michael's ex-girlfriend, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], said that this happened shortly after she chucked Michael when he became sulky over a Ravenclaw-Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] match. Michael seems to have offered Cho comfort.<ref name="OOTP" /> They may have continued to date even after Cho graduated from Hogwarts, as she went to sit by his side in the [[Room of Requirement]] upon returning to the school for the [[Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]].<ref name="DH" /> However, they must have broken up at some point because she eventually married a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]].

===Marietta Edgecombe===

[[File:Marietta Edgecombe.png|200px|thumb|[[Marietta Edgecombe]], her best friend]]
Marietta Edgecombe was Cho's friend and a fellow [[Ravenclaw]]. Marietta joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] mainly because Cho wanted her to; she was uncomfortable with opposing [[Dolores Umbridge]] because her [[Edgecombe|mother]] worked at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Cho thought no less of her for either Marietta's cynicism about the club nor Marietta's ultimate betrayal, seeing it as a forgivable mistake and being emphatically more upset that Hermione's jinx would cause an acne scar on Marietta's face for the rest of her life. She is more upset and defensive of this when she and Harry eventually talked about it, which became the straw that broke the camel's back in their relationship.<ref name="OOTP" />

===Other friendships===
Cho was, until the beginning of her sixth year, very popular. She had an entire group of Ravenclaw girl friends, who were constantly giggling, Marietta being one of them. However, as because of Cho's depression and grief-induced mood swings, all the others fell by the wayside. Being a Quidditch star and very pretty, she was the centre of the group, having a handful of friends accompany her even to the bathroom, and up until her sixth year she was never seen without them. At the welcoming feast in her sixth year, Cho chatted animatedly with her friends but later on she was mostly by herself or with Marietta.<ref name="GOF"/><ref name="OOTP"/>

===Dumbledore's Army===

[[File:Dumbledore's Army.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Dumbledore's Army]], her friends and allies]]
Cho became a member of Dumbledore's Army in [[1995]]. It was an organisation led by [[Harry Potter]], in order to oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Cho's relationship with the other members of the army is unknown, but it is possible that they were all friends. Some members of [[Ravenclaw]], such as [[Michael Corner]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Padma Patil]] and [[Luna Lovegood]] were members of the army, as well.

Other members were [[Zacharias Smith]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Hannah Abbott]] and [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] from [[Hufflepuff]], and [[Alicia Spinnet]], [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Lee Jordan]], [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Parvati Patil]] (Padma's twin), [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], and [[Colin and Dennis Creevey]] from [[Gryffindor]]. She may also have been friends with [[Katie Bell]] as the two girls were in the same year and were seen chatting to one another after the Battle of Hogwarts.

Cho was not fond of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] however; she did not trust Harry's closeness and friendship with Hermione, generally suspicious that Harry had feelings for her as well. This was one of the reasons that Cho and Harry fell apart. Ironically, Hermione was trying to give advice to Harry on building a successful relationship with Cho. As for Ron, he was tactless when Cho came to Harry, accusing her of being biased in supporting the [[Tutshill Tornados]] while being ignorant of her desire to talk to Harry alone. Naturally this did little to endear her to Ron. Furthermore, as Harry would discuss Cedric's death with both Ron and Hermione, while refusing to do the same with Cho, this only increased Cho's dislike of Harry's best friends.

[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] seemed relatively neutral about Cho, (though for obvious reasons she was not supportive of her and Harry's relationship), mentioning to Harry out of suggestion that maybe he should talk to her about Marietta instead of the long periods of avoidance from his end.

When the entire DA ostracised Marietta for betraying them, Cho alone stood up for her, putting her at odds with the rest of the group. This did not, however, appear to prevent her from retaining membership with the DA, and she fought with Dumbledore's Army during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], most of them surviving the war.

==Etymology==
*Cho is a common Sinitic and Korean name. Chang is a Chinese family name, depending on the character meaning 'prosperous' [昌], 'common' [常], 'bright' [昶], 'to sing/chant' [唱] or 'unhindered' [暢]. In Chinese, ''chóu chàng'' [惆悵] means 'melancholy'.<ref>[https://www.mugglenet.com/books/name_origins.shtml MuggleNet Name Origins]</ref> This may allude to Cho's fragile emotional state following [[Cedric Diggory]]'s murder.
*In the Chinese translations of the [[Harry Potter (book series)|''Harry Potter'' series]], the name 'Cho Chang' is translated into 張秋 'Zhāng Qiū' (pronounced 'Jah-ng Chee-oh'; in most Eastern languages, the surname precedes the given name), with 'Zhāng' being a common Chinese surname and the official pinyin transcription of 'Chang', and 'Qiū' meaning 'autumn'. 'Cho Chang' is one possible direct romanisation of 張秋 in Hong Kong, due to its dual Cantonese and British influence (for more on this, see [[Wikipedia:Hong Kong name|Hong Kong name]]). Cho Chang is portrayed in the films by [[Katie Leung]], who is of Hong Kong descent and a fluent Cantonese speaker.

*Over 3,000 girls turned up to audition for the role of Cho Chang.
*Cho was portrayed in the fourth, fifth, and sixth films and the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|two-part film adaptation]] of {{DH}} by Scottish actress [[Katie Leung]], who portrayed her as a Scot, although this is never mentioned in the books (although it would appear to have been the filmmakers' intent, since during auditions, the casting director specifically asked if any of the auditionees for the role were from Scotland).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110819075256/http://katieleungfan.com/archives/article_089.php What Katie Did Next]</ref> Katie speaks with a pronounced Glaswegian accent.
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, the character of [[Marietta Edgecombe]] does not appear, and instead it is Cho who betrays the D.A. under the influence of [[Veritaserum]]. This is also the reason for her break-up with Harry in the film, instead of her continuing grief over [[Cedric Diggory]], jealousy of [[Hermione Granger]], and defence of Marietta, as in the book. Harry, Ron, and Hermione don't know this until it is confirmed by [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]].
*In the films, Cho is in the same year as Harry which was first brought up in {{OOTP|FA}} (similar changes were made for [[Romilda Vane]] and [[Katie Bell]] in {{HBP|FA}}). This explains why she is still at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in {{DH|F2}}. In the books she is a year older than Harry and graduated at the end of the ''Half-Blood Prince''.
*Also in {{OOTP|FA}}, it was mentioned that Cho's mother worked for the Ministry, whereas in the book it was Marietta's mother that worked for the Ministry. This change was due to Marietta's removal from the film.
*In {{HBP|FA}} Cho appears in several scenes and has no speaking lines in this film.
*Cho's known [[Quidditch]] record against [[Gryffindor]] is 0-3. This includes two straight defeats playing head to head against [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]].
*Cho Chang is well known for being [[Harry Potter]]'s first crush, first kiss, and first girlfriend in the Harry Potter books and films.
*Ironically, Ginny's first boyfriend, Michael Corner, and Harry's first girlfriend, Cho, begin dating in [[1996–1997 school year|1997]].
*Katie recently portrayed Cho again, for one of [[Jessie Cave]]'s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4tEpSx0mdY Pindippy videos].
*In {{DH|F2}}, Cho appears as one of the many students of Hogwarts suffering under the Death Eater regime run by Snape and the Carrows. When Harry returns, it seems that all hard feelings about her betrayal of Dumbledore's Army have been forgotten (or forgiven) when she is one of the many people to embrace him. She is also one of the many who stand up for Harry against Pansy Parkinson's claim that they should grab him after Voldemort's ultimatum and is seen with Neville and Seamus receiving instructions from Professor McGonagall to blow up the bridge. Finally, she is seen by Harry recovering from the battle in the Great Hall. They smile at each other.
