{{Quote|I said to him, I said — Ced, that’ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will.... You beat [[Harry Potter]]!|Amos's immense pride in his son [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

'''Amos Diggory'''<ref name="GoF6" /><ref name="GoF9">{{GOF|B|9}}</ref> was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who worked for the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] in the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="GoF6" /> He and [[Cedric Diggory's mother|his wife]] lost their son [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] in [[June]] of [[1995]] during the last and third task in the [[Triwizard Tournament]], when he was murdered by [[Peter Pettigrew]] on [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s orders.<ref name="GoF32">{{GOF|B|32}}</ref>

After the events of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Amos still had not made peace with the death of his son. In [[2020]], he sought a meeting with [[Harry Potter]], in the hopes of saving his deceased son via a new [[time-turner]] that was discovered.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Amos was born into the wizarding [[Diggory family]] and was the only child of his parents.<ref name="Act3Scene18">{{CC|B|3|18}}</ref> He presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy]] in his youth, where he would have received his [[magic]]al education. 

He ended up working in the [[Ministry of Magic|British Ministry of Magic]] and by the [[1980s]], he worked for the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]].<ref name="HM1">{{HM|1|Happy Birthday, Hagrid!}}</ref>

===Hogwarts visits===
During the [[1984–1985 school year]], Amos came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to celebrate [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s [[Rubeus Hagrid's birthday celebration|birthday]]. Shortly before the celebration, he allowed [[Jacob's sibling]] to choose between a [[fire crab]], a [[Murtlap]] and a [[Porlock]] as a birthday present for Hagrid.<ref name="HMPP">{{HM|1|Party Planner}}</ref>

During the [[1987–1988 school year]], Amos came to Hogwarts once again to assist [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]] recapturing magical creatures at large all around the castle.<ref name="HMMC">{{HM|4|Magical Creatures Everywhere}}</ref>

=== Head of Student Programme ===
[[File:Enchanted windows.png|left|thumb|250x250px|Amos and Jacob's sibling standing in the All-Purpose Room]]
For the [[1990–1991 school year]], [[Hogwarts Headmaster|Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore]] arranged with the Ministry of Magic for some interested [[seventh year]] students to visit the premises for a [[Ministry of Magic student programme|student internship]]. When the students arrived at the Ministry, they were made to report to the All-Purpose Room for orientation. In the room Ministry officials handed out of the recquired credentials permitting students limited, supervised access to designated areas elsewhere at the Ministry. 

The initial head for the student programme was Amos, an investigator<ref name="HM1HB">{{HM|1|Hagrid's Birthday}}</ref> at the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], until he lost the position to [[Wilkie Twycross]] of the [[Department of Magical Transportation]].

===The 1994 Quidditch World Cup===
{{Quote|This is Amos Diggory, everyone. Works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.|[[Arthur Weasley]] introducing Amos to his children|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[File:B4C6M1 boot Portkey to Quidditch World Cup.png|250px|thumb|Amos travelling to the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]]|alt=]]

The [[Diggory family]] lived either in or near to the village of [[Ottery St Catchpole]], near the [[Weasley family|Weasley]] and [[Fawcett family|Fawcett]] families.<ref name="GoF6" /> In [[1994]], Amos and his family attended the Quidditch World Cup.<ref name="GoF6" /> After a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] riot broke out, a team of [[Wizardkind|witches and wizards]], including Amos, found the [[house-elf]] [[Winky]] lying beneath the [[Dark Mark]] and questioned her about what happened.<ref name="GoF9" />

He performed ''[[Reverse Spell|Prior Incantato]]'' on the [[Harry Potter's wand|wand]] of [[Harry Potter]] to deduce who had used the ''[[Morsmordre]]'' [[spell]].<ref name="GoF9" /> Later, he asked [[Arthur Weasley]] to help [[Alastor Moody]] out of trouble;<ref name="GoF11">{{GOF|B|11}}</ref> unbeknownst to him, this was the day Moody was kidnapped by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]].<ref name="GoF35">{{GOF|B|35}}</ref> Amos simply thought it was another false alarm from the paranoid Moody and wanted to ensure that the former [[Auror]]'s new job at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] would not be jeopardised.<ref name="GoF11" />

===The Triwizard Tournament===
{{Quote|He suffered very little then. And after all, Amos ... he died just when he'd won the tournament. He must have been happy.|Mrs Diggory comforting her grief-stricken husband Amos after Cedric's tragic death|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[File:AmosCedric.jpg|240px|thumb|Amos wishing his son good luck in the third task|alt=|left]]

That same year, Amos's son [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] was selected as Hogwarts's champion in the [[Triwizard Tournament]], something of which Amos was extremely proud.<ref name="GoF17">{{GOF|B|17}}</ref> However, [[Harry Potter]]'s name also came out of the [[Goblet of Fire]].<ref name="GoF17" /> Many people erroneously believed that Harry intentionally tried to cheat Cedric and [[Hufflepuff]] house out of their deserved glory, as he was too young to be selected and received the most publicity.<ref name="GoF17" /> Amos was openly rude to Harry before the tournament's Third Task.<ref name="GoF31" /> He made snide remarks about points to Harry's face. This infuriated [[Molly Weasley]], with whom Amos almost had a public confrontation, but his [[Cedric Diggory's mother|wife]] restrained him.<ref name="GoF31" />

[[File:Amos Diggory's grief.png|250px|thumb|Amos's devastated reaction to Cedric's lifeless body|alt=]]

Harry and Cedric considered themselves to be equally winners at the end of the tournament, thus they both touched the [[Triwizard Cup]], unwittingly taking a [[Portkey]] as part of the trap [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] set for Harry. Harry and Cedric arrived in a graveyard and Voldemort ordered his servant [[Peter Pettigrew]] to murder Cedric. Pettigrew murdered Cedric with the [[Killing Curse]], he died instantly and painlessly. Harry's and Voldemort's wands connected and Cedric's echo asked Harry to return his corpse to Amos.<ref name="GoF32" /> 

[[File:B4C37M1 Great Hall mourning Cedric's death.png|thumb|250px|Great Hall mourning Cedric's death with a memorial in his honour|left]]

Harry managed to escape the graveyard and honoured Cedric's request, returning him to his devastated parents (Amos openly sobbed later while Harry explained what happened). Amos thanked Harry for returning Cedric's body, and assured him that they did not blame Harry for his death. Harry tried to give them the prize money that came with winning the tournament, but they refused it.<ref name="GoF37">{{GOF|B|37}}</ref> It is possible that Amos and his wife attended the memorial feast held in Cedric's honour. 

===Second Wizarding War===
Amos subsequently appeared to have little to do in the [[Second Wizarding War]] waged by the [[Order of the Phoenix]] against Lord Voldemort; his son was ultimately avenged when Voldemort was defeated.

===St Oswald's Home===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Amos Diggory|Two months pass, I receive an owl, '<nowiki/>''Mr Diggory, I'm awfully sorry, but Mr Potter has been called away on urgent business, we're going to have to shift things around a little, are you available for an appointment in, let's see, in two months' time.''<nowiki/>' And then it repeats again, and again ... You're shutting me out.|Harry Potter|Of course I'm not. It's just, I'm afraid, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement I'm responsible —|There's plenty you're responsible for.|Sorry?|My son, Cedric, you do remember Cedric, don't you?|Amos expressing his frustration towards Harry Potter regarding Cedric's death|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child}}
[[File:Amos Diggory with Albus Potter and Scorpious Malfoy.png|thumb|275x275px|Amos Diggory with [[Albus Potter]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy]]]]
By [[2020]], Amos was living at [[St Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards]]. One of his carers was [[Delphini]], who affectionately called him uncle. One day, Amos heard about how [[Harry Potter]] may have found a [[time-turner]]. He decided to schedule a meeting with him. However, each meeting kept getting changed to a later date at the last minute. Several months later, Amos decided to visit Harry at his home in the middle of the night. Delphini helped Amos and he apprehended Harry when he returned home.

Amos begged Harry to use the time-turner to go back in time and save Cedric. Harry politely declined, stating he couldn’t meddle with time. Amos thought Harry was partly responsible for Cedric's death, because Voldemort never wanted Cedric. He was devastated to hear that Voldemort considered Cedric to be “the spare”. Harry lied to Amos and told him the story about a new time-turner was untrue. Amos thought Harry to be cold.<ref name="CC16">{{CC|B|1|6}}</ref>

Unbeknownst to Amos, the conversation was overheard by [[Albus Potter]]. Albus decided to visit him and tell him that he and his friend [[Scorpius Malfoy]] would be happy to go back in time and save Cedric. Amos did not take them seriously at first considering they were only children, but he was convinced they could when Delphini persuaded him and made him see even children could change the future by reminding him of the great things that happened in the [[Second Wizarding War]].<ref>{{CC|B|1|14}}</ref>

The [[Plot to restore Lord Voldemort|plan]] to save Cedric inevitably changed the future, but not to the better one Amos had hoped for. It is unknown what happened to him in the changed timelines, but they were eventually undone. This left Amos without a son again. It is not known how he felt after this, but he still lamented about Cedric and would have no choice but to accept Cedric was gone.<ref name="CC">{{CC}}</ref>

Amos was later visited by Harry and [[Draco Malfoy]], who believed that he was responsible for their sons going missing again. They found out that Amos had sent them owls, which Amos denied and said he had no idea about their whereabouts. They told Amos that the children were last sighted with his niece Delphini, which surprised Amos, since he told them that he does not have a niece.<ref>{{CC|B|3|18}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
Amos was described as being "tall"; he had a ruddy face and a "scrubby" brown beard.<ref name="GoF6" />

== Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman... but the best man won, I'm sure Harry'd say the same, wouldn't you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, it doesn't take a genius to tell which one's the better flier!|Amos regarding his son's [[Broomstick|flying skills]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

Amos was extremely proud of his son, Cedric, to the point of boasting about his accomplishments at every given opportunity.<ref name="GoF6" /> He became quite angry and disrespectful when Cedric was not even given a mention in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' story about the [[Triwizard Tournament]], whereas [[Harry Potter|Harry]] got a whole page to himself, though this was understandable, given that Cedric was meant to be the only [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] champion.<ref name="GoF31" />

[[File:AmosDiggoryWavingCampsite Still.jpg|245px|thumb|Amos waving enthusiastically to the Weasleys]]

Amos was quite genial and friendly when walking through the woods with the Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione Granger. He was rather paternal, but came off as somewhat haughty and rude due to his loud voice and boastfulness of his son's accomplishments.<ref name="GoF6" />

He was also quite emotional, roaring with joy when discussing Cedric winning a [[Quidditch]] game<ref name="GoF6" /> and roaring with anger at [[Winky]] the [[house-elf]] when interrogating her.<ref name="GoF9" /> He sobbed openly when he saw Cedric had died and when he was interviewed about his son's death, but at least didn't blame Harry for it, and contrary, believed Harry's claim of Voldemort's return and thanked him for returning Cedric's body.<ref name="GoF37" />

{{Quote|You’ve been caught red-handed, elf! Caught with the guilty wand in your hand!|Amos accusing Winky of having conjured the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup campsite|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

By the time Amos was an old man, with him stating to be dying, he was still incredibly grief-stricken to even greater levels than before. He lamented deeply about his "beautiful" son and no longer respected or cared for the memorization of Cedric to the whole wizarding world as a man who died bravely, only wanting to see him at least one last time, and showed no hesitation in attempting to meddle with time to bring him back. He displayed a level of impatience but coupled with strong determination to the point after months of relentlessly sending owls to Harry turned out to be useless, he resolved firmly to go round to his house without caring Harry had just arrived home and was about to prepare his children for a new school year, showing he had became somewhat apathetic to the needs of others in his bitterness. 

Even though he once said he didn't think Harry was responsible for Cedric's death and thanked him for bringing Cedric's body back, he changed his mind by the time he found out about a new time-turner. He thought Harry to be partly responsible since Voldemort wanted to kill him really, not Cedric. Amos would angrily declare Harry to be a stone-cold Ministry man when he would not go back in time. He was also considered a "miserable old sod" by his carers at his home.<ref name="CC" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|'Deletrius!' Mr Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke.|Amos Diggory using the [[Eradication Spell]] to erase the [[Dark Mark]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

*'''[[Magizoology]]''': As a member of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], Amos Diggory had a high level of knowledge regarding [[magic]]al [[creature]]s. He knew how to [[Ministry of Magic Classification|classify]] them and the various laws regulating the ownership of such creatures, such as [[Ban on Experimental Breeding]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Amos could produce a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]],<ref name="LEGO" /> a mark of superior magical ability and talent given the immense difficulty of performing the charm. He could also successfully cast other charms, such as the [[Eradication Spell]], which he used to eradicate the [[Dark Mark]] in the sky after it was conjured after the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], along with both [[Stunning Spell]], and its [[Counter-charm]] the [[Reviving Spell]]. He could also perform the [[Reverse Spell]], which he used to reveal that the last spell cast with [[Harry Potter]]'s [[Harry Potter's wand|wand]] during the [[Reappearance of the Dark Mark]].<ref name="GoF9" />

==Relationships==
===Diggory family===
[[File:Cedric Diggory Profile.png|250px|thumb|Cedric Diggory, his son|left]]{{Quote|A memorial? I am not interested in a memorial — not anymore. I am an old man — an old dying man — and I am here to ask you — beg you — to help me get him back.|An elderly Amos begging Harry Potter to help him see Cedric again|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child}}

Amos and his [[Cedric Diggory's mother|wife]] appeared to be a happily married couple, but she could get displeased with his often arrogant and boastful behaviour.<ref name="GoF31" /> His wife comforted Amos after the death of Cedric, remarking that he must have been happy when he died.<ref name="GoF37" />

[[Cedric Diggory]] was Amos's son. He was extremely proud of Cedric and his accomplishments, often boasting about them, making Cedric embarrassed,<ref name="GoF6" /> and was pleased by him being chosen to be in the Triwizard Tournament.<ref name="GoF17" /> Amos was devastated by his son's death and in 2020, asked Harry Potter to go back in time and bring him back, but then had to accept that Cedric was gone.<ref name="CC" />

===Weasley family===
{{Quote|Amos, think about it ... precious few wizards know how to do that [[Morsmordre|spell]].... Where would she have learned it?|Arthur Weasley disagreeing with Amos's accusations against Winky|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[Arthur Weasley]] knew Amos from the Ministry of Magic. They were quite friendly,<ref name="GoF6" /> but could be at odds, especially during Winky's interrogation.<ref name="GoF9" />

Amos's relationship with the other Weasleys is unknown, but almost had a public confrontation with [[Molly Weasley]] about Harry being in the Tournament.<ref name="GoF31" />

===Harry Potter===
{{Quote|[[Merlin's beard]]. Harry? Harry Potter?|Amos meeting Harry Potter for the first time|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[File:HBP promo side Harry cropped.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry Potter]]

[[Harry Potter]]'s relationship with Amos was rather mixed. Amos was amazed to first meet Harry Potter, but was also unintentionally rude to Harry, mostly when boasting about how [[Cedric]] beat him at Quidditch.<ref name="GoF6" /> Before the Third Task, Amos was not pleased about Cedric not being mentioned and Harry getting a whole page to himself.<ref name="GoF31" /> Despite this, Amos thanked Harry for bringing Cedric's body.<ref name="GoF37" />

{{Quote|There you are, are you? Bet you're not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric's caught you up on points, are you?|Amos angrily confronting Harry Potter before the Third Task|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
However, by [[2020]], Amos's increased grief made him blame Harry partially for Cedric's death and outright demanded Harry to bring him back through [[time]] travel and was angry and bitter when Harry refused to, declaring him a "stone-cold" Ministry man.<ref name="CC" />

===Bartemius Crouch Senior===
[[File:Barty Crouch Senior GOFF promo.jpg|250px|thumb|Barty Crouch Senior|left]]

{{Dialogue a-b|Barty Crouch Senior|Perhaps Amos is suggesting, that I routinely teach my servants to conjure the Dark Mark?|Amos Diggory|Mr Crouch ... not ... not at all ...|Barty having an angry exchange with Amos at the Quidditch World Cup campsite|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Amos's relationship with [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]] happened to be a rather strict one. When Amos thought Crouch's house-elf [[Winky]] had conjured the [[Dark Mark]], Crouch was offended by this and reprimanded Amos, especially since Crouch had proved and demonstrated throughout his long career that he detested and despised the [[Dark Arts]] and those who practise them.<ref name="GoF9" />

===Ludo Bagman===
Amos's relationship with [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] is mostly unknown, since they were only seen together after the conjuring of the Dark Mark.<ref name="GoF9" /> It is possible that their relationship was positive.

== Etymology==
"Amos" is one of the twelve minor prophets of the {{W|Old Testament}}; it means "carried" in Hebrew.<ref name="BTN">[http://www.behindthename.com/name/amos Amos] on [http://www.behindthename.com/ Behind the Name]</ref>

It is believed that the surname "Diggory" was chosen by [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] in honour of [https://narnia.fandom.com/wiki/Digory_Kirke Digory Kirke], a character created by {{W|C. S. Lewis}}, one of her favourite authors.

==Behind the scenes==
