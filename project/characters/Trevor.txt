'''Trevor''' was [[Neville Longbottom]]’s pet [[toad]], whom he frequently lost during his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Trevor was a gift from Neville’s Great Uncle [[Algie Longbottom|Algie]] in recognition of the first time Neville showed [[magic]]al ability and thus gaining admission to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Eventually, Trevor wandered off and joined the other amphibians in and around the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Family Longbottom.jpg|thumb|left|Neville with his grandmother and Trevor]]
[[Neville Longbottom|Neville]]'s great uncle [[Algie Longbottom|Algie]] used to own Trevor until he gave him to Neville as a gift from him for receiving permission to go to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].

===1990s===
[[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] lost Trevor many times. For example, the first time he came to Hogwarts on the [[Hogwarts Express]], Neville lost Trevor but was soon helped by [[Hermione Granger]] who met [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] during her search.

Neville eventually found Trevor once reaching Hogwarts in one of the boats after Hagrid asked Neville about Trevor.

[[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] once made Trevor fly around his [[Charms (class)|Charms]] classroom to skilfully demonstrate the [[Levitation Charm]].

During the night Harry, Ron and Hermione went to penetrate the [[Underground Chambers]], the trio left the common room but was confronted by Neville and a croaking Trevor until Hermione froze Neville using the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]].

In Neville's [[1993–1994 school year|third year]], Trevor was part of the [[Frog Choir]] when they performed ''[[Double Trouble]]'' on [[1 September]].

Later on the school year, [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] made Neville test his [[Shrinking Solution]] on the toad with the warning that if made incorrectly, it would likely be [[poison]]ous. After Trevor drank the [[potion]], he successfully transformed into a tadpole, much to Neville's delight. However, Professor Snape was displeased and spitefully deducted five points from [[Gryffindor]] because Hermione had helped Neville create the [[potion]].

Harry used Trevor to practise the [[Summoning Charm]] in his and Neville's [[fourth year]].

When Harry encountered Neville in the last carriage of the Hogwarts Express in their [[fifth year]], Neville had a one-handed grip on a struggling Trevor. Later, Neville dumped the toad into Harry's lap so that he could demonstrate the [[Stinksap|defensive mechanism]] of his [[Mimbulus mimbletonia|Mimbulus Mimbletonia]]. This was to Harry's regret when [[Cho Chang]] then visited the compartment, as "he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and [[Luna Lovegood]], clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap."

In [[1996]], Trevor made a bid for freedom on the Hogwarts Express, but Neville caught him again.

===Later life===
At some point, Trevor escaped into the [[Great Lake|Lake]]. Both the pet and the owner felt a sense of relief.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Trevor-Toad-Harry-Potter.jpg|210px|thumb|right|The smooth sided toad that played Trevor in the first three films]]
*The species of toad used for Trevor in {{PS|FA}} and {{POA|FA}} is a smooth sided toad.
*Trevor also appears briefly in {{COS|FA}} in front of Neville after [[Professor]] [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonnagall]] demonstrates a transfiguration spell on her pet hornbill.
*[[Matthew Lewis]], the actor of [[Neville Longbottom]], said that he's had plenty of experience with [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s while growing up.
*A fan-proposed theory stated Trevor was the Animagus form of Neville's Uncle Algie, but this was said to be false by [[J. K. Rowling]].
*In the Spanish translations of the books, Trevor has been translated to be a [[turtle]] instead of a [[toad]].
*In the scene when the trio leaves the common room to save the Philosopher's Stone, Trevor is mistakenly referred to as a female in the German version. All other times he is mentioned, including all other books, he is male.
**In the Polish version, Trevor was referred to as a female too.
*In the initial PC release of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', when Harry has a broomstick battle with Malfoy to retrieve Neville's [[Remembrall]], Neville, upon Harry's retrieval of the Remembrall, learns that Trevor is in the [[Hogwarts greenhouses|Herbology greenhouse]] and runs to find him, due to the greenhouses containing carnivorous plants.
*In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Neville finds Trevor in one of the boats (with a little help from [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]). In {{PS|FA}}, Neville finds Trevor on the top stair leading to one of the hallways to the Great Hall while [[Minerva McGonagall]] is discussing the Sorting Ceremony with the first years.
