{{Quote|"Who else had a key, then? There's been a spare key hanging in the gardener's cottage as long as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping...|Cook at the Hanged Man|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

The '''cook''' working at [[The Hanged Man]] was a resident of [[Little Hangleton]] in [[1943]]. When all three [[Riddle family|Riddles]] living in the area were murdered in their own [[Riddle House|house]], and [[Frank Bryce]] was framed for the murder (the real murderer being [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]) the townsfolk gossiped about it all around town. That night, many residents converged at the Hanged Man, the local tavern, to voice their opinions, the cook being one of them. He, like the rest, believed Frank had committed the murder.<ref>{{GOF|B|1}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*His statement about knowing of a key hanging in Frank's shed implies that he had visited the place at least once.
