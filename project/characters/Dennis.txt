{{Quote|Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader.|Description of [[Dudley Dursley's gang]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
'''Dennis''' (born c. [[1980]]) was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] and, in his youth, a member of [[Dudley Dursley]]'s [[Dudley Dursley's gang|gang]]. Dennis, along with the rest of the group, was described as "big and stupid".

During the summer months of [[1991]], Dennis would go to [[4 Privet Drive|Dudley's house]] every day, along with his friends [[Piers Polkiss]], [[Malcolm]] and [[Gordon]]. This forced [[Harry Potter]] to spend as much time as possible out of the house, as they were fond of [[Harry Hunting|bullying him]].<ref name="PS3">{{PS|B|3}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Dennis" comes from Denys or Denis, the medieval French forms of Dionysius. Saint Denis was a 3rd-century missionary to Gaul who was beheaded in Paris. He is credited with converting the Gauls to Christianity and is considered the patron saint of France.
