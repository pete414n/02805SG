{{Quote|This one, name o' Tenebrus, he's my special favourite, firs' one born here in the forest â€”|Rubeus Hagrid introducing Tenebrus|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Tenebrus''' was a [[Thestral]] who lived in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. Part of the [[Hogwarts Thestral herd|Hogwarts Thestral Herd]], he was the first Thestral to have been born in the Forest, presumably to the male and one of the five females initially acquired.<ref name="OOTP21"/>

==Biography==
He was the personal favourite of [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|gamekeeper]] [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. In [[1995]], when Hagrid introduced his [[Fifth year]] [[Care of Magical Creatures]] students to Thestrals, Tenebrus was the first to appear after he called for the herd.<ref name="OOTP21">{{OOTP|B|21}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Tenebrus is presumably derived from the English adjective ''tenebrous'', which means "dark", "gloomy", or "obscure".<ref>"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tenebrous Tenebrous]" on Dictionary.com</ref> This word is itself derived from the Latin ''tenebrae'', meaning "darkness".<ref>"[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=tenebrous&searchmode=none Tenebrous]" on The Online Etymology Dictionary</ref>
