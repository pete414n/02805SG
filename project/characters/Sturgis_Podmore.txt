{{Quote|Sturgis Podmore? He's that bloke who looks like his head's been thatched, isn't he? He's one of the Ord —|[[Ronald Weasley]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Sturgis Podmore''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] who fought in both [[First Wizarding War|First]] and [[Second Wizarding War]]s. He was also a member of the [[Advance Guard]]. In [[1995]], Podmore was put under the [[Imperius Curse]] by [[Death Eaters]], who made him attempt to break into the [[Department of Mysteries]]. He was sentenced to six months in [[Azkaban]] for attempting to break in.

==Biography==
===Early life {{c|1950s-1960s}}===
Sturgis Podmore was born at some point between [[8 September]] [[1956]] and [[7 September]] [[1957]], eventually acquiring a [[wand]] and being trained in the [[magic]]al arts.

===First Wizarding War {{c|1970s-1981}}===
{{Quote|Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he looks young...|[[Alastor Moody]] points Sturgis out in the [[Order of the Phoenix photograph]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250x250px|thumb|left|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]
Sturgis Podmore was a member of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]]. The order was an organisation founded and led by [[Albus Dumbledore]], in order to oppose [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]] during the [[First Wizarding War]]. Podmore managed to survive the war since Lord Voldemort's first downfall.

===Second Wizarding War {{c|1995-1998}}===
{{Quote|Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum Gardens, Clapham, has appeared in front of the Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August. Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watchwizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to force his way through a top-security door at one o’clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to speak in his own defence, was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban.|''[[Daily Prophet]]'', [[1 September]] [[1995]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}After [[Rebirth of Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort's return]] to full power in [[1995]], Sturgis Podmore returned to the regrouped Order of the Phoenix, contributing to their efforts during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. By this time, Sturgis lived in [[2 Laburnum Gardens]], in [[Clapham]].

====Escorting Harry Potter====
[[File:B5C3M1 Advance Guard at Privet Drive.jpg|250x250px|thumb|The [[Advance Guard]] inside 4 Privet Drive, preparing to excort Harry Potter to safety]]

Sturgis was a part of the [[Advance Guard]] — together with [[Alastor Moody]], [[Remus Lupin]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Elphias Doge]], [[Dedalus Diggle]], [[Emmeline Vance]], and [[Hestia Jones]] — that safely brought [[Harry Potter]] from [[4 Privet Drive]] to [[12 Grimmauld Place]], headquarters of the Order. Upon meeting Harry, Podmore winked at him and, while he went upstairs to get his trunk, examined the Dursleys' [[microwave]] with [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]].

====Imprisonment in Azkaban====
On [[12 August]], [[1995]], which was, incidentally, the day of [[Harry Potter]]'s [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|disciplinary hearing on the charge of magic in presence of a Muggle]], Sturgis Podmore was on Order of the Phoenix duty standing guard beside the entrance to the [[Department of Mysteries]], to prevent [[Death Eaters]] from stealing [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|The Prophecy]]. [[Lucius Malfoy]] was at the Ministry that day, and he put Podmore under the [[Imperius Curse]].

Still under the influence of Malfoy's [[Imperius Curse]], Podmore was back on guard duty at the Ministry on [[31 August]], [[1995]]. Under the control of the [[Death Eaters]], Podmore broke into the [[Department of Mysteries]], a highly classified area, and attempted to steal the Prophecy. However, he was discovered at 1 am during the attempt and was arrested by [[Eric Munch]], a [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] [[watchwizard]], and was sentenced to six months in [[Azkaban]], after refusing to speak in his defence.

[[Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] was irritated when Podmore did not return his [[Invisibility cloak]] and that he did not turn up to help transport [[Harry Potter]] safely to [[King's Cross Station]], not knowing Sturgis had been Imperiused and, by that time, arrested.

====Vindication====
After he was released from [[Azkaban]], in March of [[1996]], he rejoined the Order.

==Physical appearance==
Sturgis was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] with a square jaw and thick straw-coloured hair. These features give the impression that his head was thatched.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al skills''': Being a long-standing member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and surviving both the [[First Wizarding War]] and the [[Second Wizarding War|Second Wizarding War,]] Sturgis was a talented [[wizardkind|wizard]]. However, Sturgis was not strong enough to throw off the [[Imperius Curse]], a feat which few wizards could pull off.
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Sturgis was a skilled and accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer, being a member of the [[Advance Guard]] who successfully escorted [[Harry Potter]] to [[12 Grimmauld Place]] via broomstick flight.

==Relationships==
===Order of the Phoenix===
Sturgis' relationship with the other members of the order is unknown; it is possible that they had a good relationship. Sturgis seemed to like [[Harry Potter]], when he first met him. Harry was very upset learning that Sturgis attempted to break into the [[Department of Mysteries]], and thought it was unfair that Sturgis was imprisoned. [[Alastor Moody]] was firstly angry with Sturgis for taking his Invisibility Cloak. However, they were all upset, learning about Sturgis's imprisonment. Sturgis might have been also friendly with [[Remus Lupin]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Hestia Jones]], [[Emmeline Vance]], [[Elphias Doge]] and [[Dedalus Diggle]], as they were all members of the [[Advance Guard]] in [[1995]]. He was described as a "great friend" of [[Albus Dumbledore]], the founder of the Order.

==Behind the scenes==
*Sturgis Podmore was omitted from the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|film]] and [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game]] adaptations of {{OOTP}}.
*Sturgis Podmore may be related to Sir [[Patrick Delaney-Podmore]] of the [[Headless Hunt]].
*Sturgis Podmore was the inspiration for the satirical Harry Potter podcast of the same name, [http://tbnlpodcast.com/series/sturgis-podmore Sturgis Podmore].
*Although not confirmed, it is very likely that Sturgis fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] like most other Order of the Phoenix members. If so, he likely survived as The Order members who died were all singled out in the narrative.
*If he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Sturgis would have been a student there from [[1968]] to [[1975]]. As such, his education would have overlapped with that of the [[Marauders]] and [[Severus Snape]] by a few years.
