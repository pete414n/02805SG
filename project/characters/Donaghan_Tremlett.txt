'''Donaghan Tremlett''' (b. [[1972]]) was a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]],<ref name="fwc"/> who played [[bass]] for the popular wizarding band [[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]].<ref name="COSG"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Donaghan Tremlett was born in [[1972]] to [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Tremlett family|parents]].<ref name="fwc" /> He started playing the bass guitar at some point in his childhood, and was noted to be talented at it during his Hogwarts years.<ref name="HM2WS">{{HM|2|The Weird Sisters!}}</ref>

Donaghan began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1983]] or [[1984]].<ref>[http://harrypotter.tokenzone.com/set_2001/tokens/token_11.swf Flash card] from Harry Potter Magical Trading Cards</ref> During his Hogwarts years, he saw the [[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]] perform their song ''[[Do the Hippogriff]]'' and auditioned to become the new bass player of the band. Donaghan became a member of the band, replacing [[Jacob's sibling]], as he could actually play the bass without the use of [[magic]].<ref name="HM2WS"/>

Donaghan's favourite [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch team|team]] was the [[Kenmare Kestrels]].<ref name="fwc" />

===Later life===
[[File:Donaghan Tremlett playing bass.png|thumb|left|140px|Donaghan Tremlett playing at the Yule Ball]]
On [[25 December|Christmas Day]] in [[1994]], the band attended the [[Yule Ball]] at Hogwarts,<ref name="GOF23">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref> where they played classic hits like "[[Magic Works]]" and "[[This Is the Night]]", as well as a new song titled "[[Do the Hippogriff]]".<ref name="GOFF">{{GOF|F}}</ref>

Donaghan married [[Donaghan Tremlett's spouse|an individual]] in September [[1995]]. The wedding was mentioned in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' on [[7 September]].<ref name="OOTP14">{{OOTP|B|14}} - "'No,' she sighed, 'just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married. ...'"</ref>

[[File:Funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|right|The [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore]] that Donaghan attended]]

After the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|taken over]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in September 1997, Donaghan, as a [[Muggle-born]], presumably faced charges before the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. He may have been sent to [[Azkaban]], or else gone into hiding, like many others of his heritage.
