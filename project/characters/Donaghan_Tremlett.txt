'''Donaghan Tremlett''' (b. [[1972]]) was a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], who played [[bass]] for the popular wizarding band [[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Donaghan Tremlett was born in [[1972]] to [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Tremlett family|parents]].

Donaghan began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1983]] or [[1984]]. During his Hogwarts years, he saw the [[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]] perform their song ''[[Do the Hippogriff]]'' and auditioned to become the new bass player of the band. Donaghan became a member of the band, replacing [[Jacob's sibling]], as he could actually play the bass without the use of [[magic]].

Donaghan's favourite [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch team|team]] was the [[Kenmare Kestrels]].

===Later life===

On [[25 December|Christmas Day]] in [[1994]], the band attended the [[Yule Ball]] at Hogwarts, where they played classic hits like "[[Magic Works]]" and "[[This Is the Night]]", as well as a new song titled "[[Do the Hippogriff]]".

Donaghan married [[Donaghan Tremlett's spouse|an individual]] in September [[1995]]. The wedding was mentioned in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' on [[7 September]].

In June [[1997]], Donaghan attended the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] of [[Albus Dumbledore]], and was one of several familiar people [[Harry Potter]] noticed among the crowd.

After the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|taken over]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in September 1997, Donaghan, as a [[Muggle-born]], presumably faced charges before the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. He may have been sent to [[Azkaban]], or else gone into hiding, like many others of his heritage.

==Physical appearance==
Donaghan was described as "hairy" and, like all members of the Weird Sisters, wore "artfully torn" black robes when onstage.

==Behind the scenes==
*Donaghan Tremlett was portrayed by [[Steve Mackey]] in {{GOF|FA}}.
*Depending on his month of birth, he may have been in the same year as [[Charles Weasley]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Jacob's sibling]], among others.
