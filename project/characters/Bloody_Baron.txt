The '''Bloody Baron''' (d. [[11th century]]) was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[Hogwarts founders|Founders]]' time and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].

After Hogwarts, he fell in [[love]] with [[Helena Ravenclaw]], but she did not love him in return. He was sent by [[Rowena Ravenclaw]] to find Helena in [[Albania]], but Helena refused to return with him and so he killed her in a rage. When he realised what he had done, the Baron stabbed himself with the same knife and died by suicide.<ref name="DH31"/>

After his [[death]], he became one of the ghosts that haunts [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and the ghost of Slytherin House. Covered in Helena Ravenclaw's blood to this day, he earned himself the moniker of "Bloody Baron".<ref name="DH31"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|The baron was always a hot-tempered man.|[[Helena Ravenclaw]] relaying the Baron's personality prior to his death|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
The Baron was born into nobility, no earlier than [[First millennium A.D.|982]].<ref name="birthdate" />

At the age of eleven, the Baron became part of one of the first generations of students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[Scotland]], which, at that time, was still being run by its original Founders. He was sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] and was educated in the magical arts by [[Salazar Slytherin]] for the seven years that followed.<ref name="House" />

Sometime around this time the Baron met [[Helena Ravenclaw]], daughter of [[Rowena Ravenclaw]], whom he fell in love with, though she always rejected his advances.<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

===Death===
{{Quote|He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became violent. The baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me... When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence... as he should.|Helena telling [[Harry Potter|Harry]] the story of her and the Baron's death|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Later on in his life, Helena, after stealing a [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|diadem]] belonging to her mother that increased the intelligence of the wearer, ran away to [[Albania]]. Around this same time, [[Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena]] fell fatally ill,<ref name="DH31" /> although legend has it that it was a broken heart,<ref name="WotM">{{JKRS}} - ''[[Wizard of the Month]]''</ref> possibly caused by her daughter abandoning her. Rowena ordered the Baron to go after her, which he did, eventually finding her hiding in a forest.<ref name="DH31"/>

After he had found her, the Baron tried to compel her to return with him, but she refused, and, in a fit of rage, he killed her. Overcome with grief, he proceeded to take his own life with the same weapon he used to stab Helena.<ref name="DH31" />

===Post-mortem===
{{Quote|Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.|Description of the Baron|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Ghosts_of_Hogwarts.jpg|245px|thumb|left|The Bloody Baron in his blood-stained clothes standing next to the other House [[Ghost]]s]]
The Baron, as well as Helena, now known as the [[Helena Ravenclaw|Grey Lady]], both returned from the dead as ghosts, and returned to [[Hogwarts Castle]], where they became the house ghosts of their former Houses, [[Slytherin]] and [[Ravenclaw]] respectively.<ref name="PS7" /> 

The Baron had been remorseful of his actions ever since, and carried heavy chains as a sign of penance.<ref name="DH31" /> Nobody else seemed to know why he was covered in blood, not even the other two [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[ghost]]s.<ref name="PS7" /> For unspecified reasons, presumably related to his apparently violent, dangerous nature, the Baron had gained [[Peeves]]'s respect and was the only one, besides Professor Dumbledore, who could give him orders.<ref name="PS7" />

According to [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]], groaning and clanking in the [[Astronomy Tower]] was a favourite pastime of the Baron's.<ref name="HBP23">{{HBP|B|23}}</ref> Also according to Sir Nicholas, the Bloody Baron had many times frightened a young Slytherin student in the [[Slytherin Common Room]].<ref name="HM3NHN">{{HM|3|Nearly Headless Nick}}</ref>

====[[1988–1989 school year]]====
[[File:Bloody Baron speaking to students HM56.png|250px|thumb|right|The Bloody Baron speaking to several Slytherin students in the Potions Classroom]]
In their search for the [[Marauder's Map]], [[Jacob's sibling]], along with Slytherin students [[Merula Snyde]], [[Ismelda Murk]], [[Barnaby Lee]] and [[Liz Tuttle]], went to the [[Potions Classroom]] to ask the Bloody Baron about [[Duncan Ashe]]. The Baron revealed that Duncan was a ghost.<ref name="HM56">{{HM|5|6}}</ref>

Later during the year, Merula and Jacob's sibling spoke to him in the [[Slytherin Common Room]] to ask if he had seen [[Peeves]]. However, he refused to part with any information about Peeves and was not much help to them.<ref name="HM521">{{HM|5|21}}</ref>

====[[1991–1992 school year]]====
{{Quote|So — new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row!

[[File:Bloody_baron_ps.jpg|250px|thumb|The Baron at the [[1991]] [[Start-of-Term Feast]]|alt=|left]]
On [[1 September]] [[1991]], the Baron attended the Start-of-Term Feast, where he sat next to first year [[Draco Malfoy]], who did not look too pleased with the seating arrangements.<ref name="PS7" />

A while before midnight on [[12 September]] 1991, the Bloody Baron passed twice by the Fat Lady's Corridor, frightening [[Neville Longbottom]], who was sleeping in the corridor because he had forgotten the new password to get into [[Gryffindor Tower]].<ref name="PS9">{{PS|B|9}}</ref>

Shortly prior the [[Hallowe'en feast]] on [[31 October]], the Baron haunted the [[Dungeons]].<ref name="PSpc">{{PS|G}} - PC version</ref>

In the evening of [[4 June]] during their quest to save the Philosopher's Stone from Lord Voldemort, [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]], all under the [[Cloak of Invisibility]], were intercepted by [[Peeves]] who threatened to call [[Argus Filch]] if whoever that was there did not show themselves. Harry Potter, in a hoarse whisper, proceeded to impersonate the Baron.<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

====[[1992–1993 school year]]====
{{Quote|They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts.|Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

It can be assumed that the Baron attended the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] with the other ghosts, as they seem to do every year. 

On the evening of [[31 October]] [[1992]], the Baron attended [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]]'s [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|five-hundredth Deathday Party]]. The other ghosts appeared to avoid him during the celebration.<ref name="CS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref> This was most likely due to his ghoulish blood-stained appearance and the shackles he wore.

He spent [[Christmas]] day strolling the [[Slytherin Corridors|dungeons]] by the [[Slytherin Dungeon]].<ref name="CSpc">{{COS|G}} - PC version</ref>

====[[1994–1995 school year]]====
{{Quote|Peeves, of course. The usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the feast — well, it's quite out of the question, you know what he's like, utterly uncivilised, can't see a plate of food without throwing it. We held a ghost's council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his foot down.|The ghost council and their issues with [[Peeves]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

In the afternoon of [[1 September]] [[1994]], the Hogwarts ghosts [[Ghost's council|gathered]] to decide whether [[Peeves]] should be allowed to attend the [[Start-of-Term Feast]]. The [[Fat Friar]] wanted to give him another chance, but both [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] and the Bloody Baron decided against it. As a result, [[Peeves]] wreaked havoc in the [[Hogwarts kitchens|kitchens]], spilling soup all over the place and scattering pots and pans everywhere.<ref name="GF12">{{GOF|B|12}}</ref>

Later in the year, the Baron encountered [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] in the [[North Tower]], while they were talking about [[Sybill Trelawney]]'s alleged predictions of Harry's death.<ref name="GF21">{{GOF|B|21}}</ref>

[[File:Bloody Baron in Potions Classroom HM56.png|250px|thumb|left|The Bloody Baron in the Potions dungeon]]
By [[1995]], there was a [[Portrait|tetraptych]] of the Baron hung in the [[Hogwarts Basement|dungeon cupboard]]. He would frequently haunt this area of the [[Dungeons]] during this school year.<ref name="OPg">{{OOTP|G}}</ref>

During the [[Start-of-Term Feast]], on [[1 September]] [[1995]], [[Ronald Weasley]] managed to inadvertently insult [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]], by saying the ghost was afraid of the Bloody Baron when he said he would never dream of seeking an argument with the Baron.<ref name="OP11">{{OOTP|B|11}}</ref>

A week later, on [[7 September]], [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] looked for the Baron to see if he could dissuade [[Peeves]] from dropping a bust of [[Phillipus von Hohenheim|Paracelsus]] on top of anyone who passed the corridor in which the bust stood.<ref name="OP14">{{OOTP|B|14}}</ref>

{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Where is he?|Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it's a favourite pastime of his —|A gloomy favourite pastime of the Baron|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

In the early hours of [[22 April]], [[1997]], the Bloody Baron saw [[Albus Dumbledore]] return to the Castle from one of his missions to find [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es, and reported it to [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]]. He later retreated to the [[Astronomy Tower]] where he liked to groan and clank.<ref name="HBP23" />

=====[[1997–1998 school year]]=====
On [[2 May]] [[1998]], the Battle of Hogwarts ensued after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] learned [[Harry Potter]] was in the premises. The ghosts, likely including the Baron, attended a gathering in the [[Great Hall]], in which [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] gave instructions on evacuation of underage students and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] organised the participants for battle.<ref name="DH31" /> 

Later on, the ghosts gathered at the [[Great Hall]], joining the mass mourning over the dead.<ref name="DH12">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>

==Physical description==
[[File:PM Hogwarts ghost Bloody Baron.gif|200px|thumb|The Bloody Baron's ghoulish appearance, bound in his chains]]
{{Quote|The Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent spectre covered in silver bloodstains.|Description|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
As a ghost, the Baron was very pale,<ref name="PS10" /> pearly-white and slightly transparent.<ref name="PS7" /> He had wide, staring,<ref name="GF21" /> black eyes<ref name="PS7" /> and a gaunt face.<ref name="PS7" /> He dressed in robes covered in silver bloodstains,<ref name="GF12" /> and carried chains in a final act of penitence for having murdered [[Helena Ravenclaw]].<ref name="DH31" /> 

He sported a curly powdered wig, fashions closer to the 17th century than the 10th, and carried his sword.<ref name="PSf13">{{PS|F}} - Chapter 13 (''Nick and Other Residents'')</ref> He spoke in a hoarse whisper.<ref name="PS16" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b|Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Well, now, you shouldn't take that attitude. Peaceful cooperation, that's the key. We ghosts, though we belong to separate houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.|Ronald Weasley|Only because you're terrified of him.|An exchange between [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] and [[Ronald Weasley]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
During his lifetime, the Baron was described by [[Helena Ravenclaw]] as a "''hot-tempered man''". He insisted on having his way in interactions, responding with violent uncontrolled anger when contradicted.<ref name="DH31" /> As a ghost, he was frightening and most people did not seem to enjoy his presence,<ref name="PS7" /> not even his fellow [[ghost]]s.<ref name="CS8" /> 

However, he seemed to have a cordial, if not friendly, relationship with the ghost of [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington]],<ref name="HBP23" /> despite [[Ronald Weasley]]'s allegations of the latter being "''terrified''" of him.<ref name="OP11" /> The Baron seemed to be intolerant towards [[Peeves]], who was scared of him,<ref name="PS16" /> and could not bear his lack of civilisation, putting "''his foot down''" over the [[Poltergeist]]'s potential presence at the [[1994]] [[Start-of-Term Feast]].<ref name="GF12" /> 

He also seemed to have a great deal of House pride; before [[Harry Potter]]'s arrival at Hogwarts, [[Slytherin]] had won the House Cup for six years in a row, and the Baron had become "''unbearable''" according to [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]].<ref name="PS7" />

==Behind the scenes==

[[File:Bloody Baron LEGO.jpg|150px|thumb|The Bloody Baron in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
[[File:Baron_Pop.jpg|thumb|The Bloody Baron as a [[POP! Vinyl]]]]
*In the Welsh translation, the Baron's name is given as Waldo.
*Though the Bloody Baron committed suicide, it did not stop him from returning as a ghost.
*The Bloody Baron is the only Hogwarts house ghost in the books without any on-'screen' dialogue.
*In {{PS|FA}}, the Bloody Baron is portrayed by [[Terence Bayler]].
*In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], the Baron is depicted as being quite mirthful, in stark contrast to the solemn and quite terrifying character in the books. In the video games, however, the Baron resumes his "book" persona. Another notable change in the films is that the bloodstains are made red instead of silver, likely so that it would be visually noticeable and immediately identifiable (rather than having to differentiate silver on a pearly-white ghost).
**His [[POP!]] miniature also has red blood stains.
*In all of his media appearances, the Bloody Baron appears in late seventeenth century attire. This wardrobe was chosen for {{PS|FA}}, when the Baron's death date was uncertain. This, of course, is not consistent with {{DH}}, in which he is revealed to have died in the eleventh century.
**His epithet, the Bloody Baron, may also be an anachronism, as feudalism was not introduced in the British Isles until after the Norman conquest in 1066, and therefore there were no barons until this time (unless he died shortly after the conquest). This is probably explained by it, along with Helena Ravenclaw's title of 'the Grey Lady', and the Fat Friar, being a nickname he acquired later on.
*In {{PS|FA}}, the Bloody Baron resembles Captain James Hook (as played by Dustin Hoffman) in the film ''Hook''. Coincidentally, that film features [[Maggie Smith]], who plays [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], as well as a music score by [[John Williams]].
*The Baron is encountered in the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (PC, Mac)|PC/Mac version of ''Philosopher's Stone'']] walking the labyrinthine dungeon corridors where [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] sends [[Harry Potter]] to find four crucial [[potion]] ingredients. In the next generation version of Chamber of Secrets, the Baron can be seen walking the path from the dungeons through the entrance hall to the teacher's lounge corridor, every night, the chilling sound of his footsteps echoing through the hall each time as he approaches.
*In {{COS|GA}}, it is mentioned he cannot speak.
*In the credits of {{PS|FA}}, his name is misspelt as "Bloody Barron".
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (PS2)|PS2 version of the video game adaptation]] of {{POA}}, there is a large statue of the Bloody Baron on the [[North Wing]].
*In chapter 19 of year 6 of {{HM}}, the Bloody Baron will attend the [[memorial ceremony for Rowan Khanna]] in the [[Great Hall]], if [[Rowan Khanna]] was chosen as a [[Slytherin]] in the game.<ref name="HM619">{{HM|6|19}}</ref>
