{{Quote|Lucius, my slippery friend. I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius.|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] regarding Lucius's dual nature|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
'''Lucius Malfoy''' (b. [[1953]]/[[1954]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[pure-blood]] [[wizardkind|wizard]], and son of [[Abraxas Malfoy]], husband of [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Black]], the father of [[Draco Malfoy]] and the grandfather of [[Scorpius Malfoy]]. As well as a member of the [[Malfoy family]]. Lucius was educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], where he was made a [[prefect]] in [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. As an adult, Lucius was an aristocratic wizard and patriarch of the [[Malfoy family]], believing strongly in notions of blood purity and the [[Pure-blood supremacy|superiority of pure-blood]] wizards. He joined the [[Death Eaters]], who shared his views on blood purity, and participated in the [[First Wizarding War]], becoming Voldemort's second-in-command. However, he was replaced by Bellatrix Lestrange in the Second Wizarding War.

After [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s first defeat, Lucius managed to avoid imprisonment by lying that he had been acting under the [[Imperius Curse]]. He and his family remained members of the social elite, though Lucius continued to demonstrate his prejudice. He attempted to sabotage [[Arthur Weasley]]'s career by slipping Arthur's daughter an old school diary of Tom Riddle's, opening the [[Chamber of Secrets]] in [[1992]], and in [[1994]], he participated in the humiliation of a [[Roberts family|Muggle family]] after the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]].

When Voldemort [[Return of Lord Voldemort|returned]], Lucius once again served him as a Death Eater, leading the efforts to obtain [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|the prophecy]] Voldemort sought. In the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|battle]] that ensued, the prophecy was destroyed, and Lucius and his comrades were imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] in [[1996]]. Although Voldemort broke them out of prison in [[1997]], he was displeased with Lucius for his failures and treated the Malfoys with much disdain and abuse. Lucius and his family finally rebelled against Voldemort's tyranny and defected before the end of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], with them all surviving the [[Second Wizarding War]].

Because he and his family defected from the [[Death Eaters]] they were pardoned for their crimes after Voldemort's final defeat and did not serve a stint in [[Azkaban]]. He and Narcissa later had a grandson, [[Scorpius Malfoy]], after Draco married [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]].

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1953/1954–1965/1966}}===
Lucius Malfoy was born in [[1953]] or [[1954]] in [[Great Britain]] and raised in the lap of luxury at the ancestral home of [[Malfoy Manor]] in the county of [[Wiltshire]] in [[England]]; a magnificent mansion that had been in his family's possession for around a thousand years. Historically rather well-known for their cast-iron belief in [[Wizarding supremacy|wizards' superiority]] over [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and espousal of [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood values]], Lucius adopted the unfeigned contempt for the [[Non-magic world|Muggle world]] of his elders from a young age and was encouraged to make friends '[[Blood status|of the right sort]]' when the time came for him to attend school, a sentiment Lucius would later follow to the point where he viewed those who openly [[Blood traitor|associated themselves]] with Muggles to be a "''disgrace to the name of wizard''". 

Descending from a long line of cold, brutal fathers that produced cold, brutal sons, while it is unknown just how close he was with his parents during his formative years, quite arguably the biggest influence in his young life was that of his father. A proud member of the social elite that commanded great respect in certain circles, [[Abraxas Malfoy]] was, in addition to a harshly demanding parent with high expectations and known to have kept a collection of dark magical artefacts harking back to family history, also a man of considerable (and much resented) influence at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[London]]; all things that Lucius would eventually go on to emulate later in life.

===Hogwarts years {{C|1965/1966–1972/1973}}===
Lucius was educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from around the year of [[1965]]/[[1966]] to [[1972]]/[[1973]], once there he honoured his family's tradition of being [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]], a place where many other like-minded young idealists was often found. It was during this time that he first met his future wife, a proud member of the [[House of Black|Noble and Most Ancient House of Black]]; one of the most prominent pure-blooded wizarding families in Great Britain, and, like the Malfoys, one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]. 

Lucius's [[third year]] also saw the premature retirement of [[Nobby Leach]], the first [[Muggle-born]] [[Minister for Magic]] to ever hold office, after he fell ill with a mysterious illness. Before long, a number of conspiracy theories were circulating regarding what actually happened to him, and for a time, Lucius's own father fell under suspicion of having had a hand in the shady plot that led Leach to resign, although nothing was ever proven against him.

[[File:Slug Club3.png|250px|thumb|left|Lucius as a member of the [[Slug Club]] in his student years]]
The scion of an old wizarding family noted for its wealth and influence, Lucius was ultimately a model student that lead by example and became a voice of authority among his peers, and who effectively managed to uphold his family's name, be a credit to Slytherin House and master the art of keeping up appearances all in one fell swoop when he was named a [[Prefect]] in his [[fifth year]], and by being invited to join the out-of-hours dining and social club hosted by their always talent-scouting [[Potions Master]], [[Horace Slughorn]], known as the '[[Slug Club]]'. 

In [[1971]]. Lucius also became the first person apart from [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] to ever extend [[Severus Snape]] a hand of friendship when he warmly welcomed him into the [[Slytherin|fold]] after the latter's sorting into the same house; a gesture that marked the beginning of a lifelong, mutual respect and camaraderie between the two young wizards. Which was not to say, however, that his magical education was by any means an uneventful one.

Lucius's arrival at school coincided with a recent [[First Wizarding War|increase in dark magical activity]] throughout [[Great Britain]]; while few knew what lay behind the mounting attacks and sightings, the truth was finally revealed in the form of a [[Dark wizard]] of immense power. But whereas [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]] were swiftly becoming a source of widespread fear by a most of his own [[Wizardkind|kind]], Lucius, on the other hand, found himself rather agreeing with their views regarding the [[Magic is Might|treatment]] that the non-magical community deserved.

Over the course of his schooling, Lucius also developed a strong dislike for the school's [[Head of Transfiguration]]. Not only a shamelessly vocal pro-Muggle activist, [[Albus Dumbledore]] was also quickly becoming the biggest symbol and rallying point for opposition to the Dark Forces, thus representing everything that Lucius despised. As such, when Dumbledore succeeded [[Armando Dippet]] as [[Hogwarts Headmaster|headmaster]], Lucius saw it as the worst thing ever to have happened to Hogwarts; a sentiment he would carry with him into to adulthood.

===First Wizarding War {{C|1972/1973–1981}}===
{{Quote|Malfoy's been giving generously to all sorts of things for years... gets him in with the right people... then he can ask favours... delay laws he doesn't want passed... Oh, he's very well-connected, Lucius Malfoy.|[[Arthur Weasley]] regarding Lucius's former influence at the Ministry|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Lucius graduated from Hogwarts around the year of [[1972]]/[[1973]], and being independently wealthy and with no need to work for a living, continued to inhabit the family estate; free at last to enjoy full-time the creature comforts that their ancestral home had provided him throughout his privileged upbringing. At some point, he also became romantically involved with [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Black]], a fellow wealthy pure-blood and [[Slytherin]] student back at Hogwarts with whom he had a lot in common; not least of all their shared anti-Muggle sentiments, fondness for the lavish and privileged lifestyle that their rich family vaults afforded them. In due time, the uppish couple entered what was seen as a very respectable, pure-blood [[marriage]], and took up residence at [[Malfoy Manor]]. 

In doing so, Lucius also officially assumed both the patriarchy of the [[Malfoy family]], ownership of their [[house-elf]], [[Dobby]], and gained the possession of a prized [[Lucius Malfoy's walking stick|family heirloom]] that had been passed down for many generations. This, he began to carrying around with him, both as a status symbol and as a replacement for his original wand. Heir apparent to a long line of wily beneficiaries of political patronage in the magical community, Lucius also wasted little time in carrying on the family tradition of frequenting the headquarters of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[London]], where he successfully used his family name and fortune to curry favour with a number of high-ranking Ministry officials, and became a very well-connected man.

That was not to say, however, that this was all he aspired to do with his life, because even though his former teachers had done an adequate job of sheltering their charges from the storm that had only continued to brew in the world beyond [[Hogwarts Castle]] in the years that he had resided there, and despite the [[Curse-to-kill|strong-arm tactics]] that the [[Auror Office]] had been [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|authorised]] to employ in the effort to suppress it, it was nevertheless the case that the Dark Lord's campaign of violence had just grown ever fiercer. Throughout the entirety of his magical education, Lord Voldemort and his followers had only been gaining in strength, until finally the ongoing conflict culminated in the [[First Wizarding War]]. 

In the motley collection that made up Lord Voldemort's innermost circle of followers, Lucius most certainly fell into the category of "''the ambitious seeking some shared glory''". By the time Lucius left Hogwarts, rumours had also began to circulate that the Lord Voldemort, who had indulged in all manner of [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]] in an attempt to make himself invincible, had somehow made himself [[Immortality|immortal]], thus further cementing the idea that he was unstoppable. And, being no less enthralled by their quest for the purification of the wizarding race than before, not to mention very much in favour of the idea to rid the world of [[Muggle-born]]s and putting [[pure-blood]]s in charge, Lucius eventually swore his eternal allegiance to the Dark Lord and, officially joined the ranks of the [[Death Eaters]] in earnest.

Although never made privy to the names of every one of his new comrades, they were all still able to tell each other apart when it mattered by the masks they wore to conceal their identities; which were all unique to the individual using them. Not only was he ideally positioned supply his brothers-in-arms with important information directly from the Ministry itself, but nor did he, as an advocate for violence and unafraid to use it himself, shy away from lending an extra wand in actually waging the war either. More than willing to turn his talents to [[Imperius Curse|coercion]], [[Cruciatus Curse|torture]], [[Killing Curse|murder]] and other atrocities in order to carry out his Master's bidding if called upon to do so, Lucius quickly proved himself a most valuable servant to the Dark Lord. 

[[File:Masked Death Eaters (Concept Artwork for the HP4 film).jpg|250px|thumb|Lucius Malfoy and his fellow Death Eaters]]
By the height of the war, Lucius had risen ambitiously through the ranks of the Dark Lord's followers and even placed in charge of his fellow Death Eaters, becoming second-in-command to their Master himself; a time Lucius would later go on to call their family's "glory days".

And just when victory seemed to be within reach, and Lucius his family were at the very cusp of authority and prestige the likes of which his family had never known, Narcissa gave birth to their son and only child, [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]], in [[1980]]. Around the same time, Lucius was entrusted the Dark Lord's [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|old school diary]], which he was told had been cleverly bewitched so that whenever smuggled into [[Hogwarts Castle]], it would reopen the legendary [[Chamber of Secrets]] and send the [[Serpent of Slytherin|monster]] living inside to finish [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s "noble work" of cleansing the school of all [[Muggle-born]] students, a plan he was supposed to carry out only when he had been told to do so by Voldemort himself.

When, however, by then fellow Death Eater and spy for the Dark Lord, [[Severus Snape]], revealed that he had eavesdropped on a job interview between [[Albus Dumbledore]] and a prospective [[Divination]] Professor by the name of [[Sybill Trelawney]] at the [[Hog's Head Inn]] and learned of a [[prophecy|foretelling]] of their Master's downfall, Lord Voldemort concluded that [[Harry Potter]] were the child who had been prophesied to bring about his destruction and subsequently marked the [[Potter family|Potters]] for death shortly afterwards. Securely hidden by the powerful [[Fidelius Charm]], however, it was only when one of their own friends and [[Secret Keeper]], [[Peter Pettigrew]], joined them out of fear and disclosed their whereabouts that this new enemy could be dealt with.

Upon learning this, the Dark Lord personally left to bring about the destruction of this one, inexplicable threat, only for his [[Killing Curse]] to rebound back at himself, obliterating his body instead. Following the apparent demise of what had appeared to be their almighty leader, the Death Eaters were left shocked and distraught. Subsequently, the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and the [[Ministry of Magic]] were able to round up many of his followers. By no means inclined to risk his own social standing and the reputation of the [[Malfoy family]] in a [[Duelling|duel]] with the [[Auror]]s; he had already went on a careful campaign of bribery, blackmail, and flattery to win his freedom.

This meant that by the time he was brought in front of the [[Council of Magical Law]] to answer charges relating to his activities as a Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy had so many high-placed Ministry officials in his pocket that the official story, namely that he had been acting under the influence of the [[Imperius Curse]], was a little more than a formality. Thus, even though many like [[Arthur Weasley]], the Head of the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]], never believed his version of the events, Lucius nevertheless became one of the first to "come back" to the right side and released from custody.

===Between the wars {{C|1981–1995}}===
{{Quote|They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] talking about Lucius's involvement with Voldemort|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Lucius Malfoy at Malfoy Manor with his dogs.jpeg|left|thumb|250x250px|Malfoy at [[Malfoy Manor|his manor]] in [[Wiltshire]]]]
Lucius lived a rather good life with his family. Independently wealthy and therefore without any need to work, he was more than content with a settled life, preoccupying himself with upholding his influence in the [[Ministry of Magic]] and maintaining a collection of dark artefacts harking back to family history. Lucius eventually went on to raise his son in an atmosphere of regret that the [[Dark Wizard|Dark Lord]] had not succeeded in taking command of the wizarding community. Lucius did not search for Voldemort after his sudden disappearance, believing him to have died that night in [[Godric's Hollow]].

Despite his high standing in the ranks of the Dark Forces, his loyalties were primarily towards the ''cause'' rather than to the man representing it, as shown by how he still associated with some of his former comrades who, like him, avoided [[Azkaban]], many of whom became close friends of the family. Indeed, he even remained in touch with [[Igor Karkaroff]], who had won his freedom after capture by cowardly putting a numerous amount of Lucius's old comrades into Azkaban in his place. The most prominent evidence for his initial disinterest in revisiting his past and lack of faithfulness to the Dark Lord himself was how Lucius disregarded rumours of Lord Voldemort's survival as wishful thinking, and instead took interest in potentially allying himself with the very person who had brought about their former Master's downfall. 

Many different theories regarding how [[Harry Potter|The-Boy-Who-Lived]] had survived the Dark Lord's attack were made over the years, the most persistent of them being that the boy himself was a great [[Dark Wizard]]. This assumption was one Lucius prescribed to most eagerly, even taking comfort in the thought that he one day might get a second chance of world domination if [[Harry Potter]] grew up to become another, and greater, [[pure-blood]] champion.

As the time of Draco's magical education grew ever closer, Lucius informed his wife that it was his wish for their son to attend [[Durmstrang Institute]], where Karkaroff now was Headmaster. The school did not allow [[Muggle-born]]s to attend, and it was also argued that Durmstrang took a 'far more sensible line' about the [[Dark Arts]] than Hogwarts, which was still headed by [[Albus Dumbledore]], whom Lucius held in no higher regard after the war than he had during it for the man's advocacy for Muggle rights and other values that went against their own. His wife, on the other hand, did not like the idea of Draco going to school so far away; thus they decided that he would go to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] after all.

====Joining the Board of Governors====
{{Quote|Any work of fiction or nonfiction that depicts interbreeding between wizards and Muggles should be banned from the bookshelves of Hogwarts. I do not wish [[Draco Malfoy|my son]] to be influenced into sullying the purity of his bloodline by reading stories that promote wizard-Muggle marriage.|Malfoy's requesting "''The Fountain of Fair Fortune''" to be banned from Hogwarts|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
[[File:Malfoy family.jpeg|250px|thumb|The Malfoy family portrait]]
It was presumably in order to influence the day-to-day running of Hogwarts as much as possible and undermine Dumbledore's authority and influence which led him to join the [[Hogwarts Board of Governors]]. As a governor, Lucius submitted a demand to the Headmaster to have ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' banned from the Hogwarts library, as it depicted a love between a [[Amata|witch]] and a [[Sir Luckless|Muggle]]. Malfoy claimed that he did not want his son, [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]], to be influenced into sullying his pure-blood by reading a story that promoted marriage between wizards and Muggles.

Dumbledore's refusal to allow the book to be removed was backed by a majority of the other Governors, and Dumbledore wrote back to Malfoy saying that pure-blood families maintained their so-called purity by disowning, banishing, or lying about [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and [[Muggle-born]]s in their family trees, and then ask for works that dealt with these truths to be banned. Dumbledore considered it illogical and immoral to remove works dealing with the mixture of wizard blood and Muggle blood for the knowledge of the students. [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s response prompted several further letters from Lucius, consisting of "opprobrious remarks" on Dumbledore's sanity, parentage, and hygiene. This also marked the beginning of Malfoy's long campaign to have him removed from the post of Headmaster of Hogwarts.

During the [[1985–1986 school year]], he arrived at the school for a surprise inspection, which he claimed was on instructions of the board, bringing Draco with him. He questioned several teachers and students, including [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Ben Copper]]. Lucius entrusted [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Merula Snyde]] to babysit Draco, having specifically requested those two students as Jacob's sibling was said to be the best student in their year and Merula was the scion of two of Lucius's Death Eater comrades and thus considered the "appropriate" kind of person for Draco to socialise with. The decision did not rub off well with any of the three, as the two older students were irritated and disgusted by the younger Malfoy's snobbishness and prejudiced remarks.

During the inspection, [[Lucius Malfoy's wand|Lucius's wand]] went missing. He refused to leave without it and initially blamed the theft on their [[house-elf]] [[Dobby]], as the perpetrator knew Lucius kept his wand inside his [[Lucius Malfoy's walking stick|walking stick]], which wasn't common knowledge. Jacob's sibling investigated and discovered that Draco had taken his father's wand, as he was too young to have his own and wanted to perform magic after seeing Merula perform the [[Jelly-Legs Curse]] on Jacob's sibling. They successfully convinced Draco to tell them where the wand was, and returned it to Lucius.

====Opening of the Chamber of Secrets====
{{Quote|Here, girl —  take your book — it's the best your father can give you —|Lucius slipping [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's diary]] into [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]'s school books in Flourish and Blotts|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
In [[1992]], during his son's return home from his first year at Hogwarts, Lucius was informed of Harry Potter's refusal of Draco's offer for friendship in favour of his allegiance to the Weasleys through their youngest [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]]. Despite his disappointment that the wild hopes of the ex-[[Death Eaters]] — that Harry was another, and better, Voldemort — were completely unfounded, he nevertheless discouraged Draco from seeming "less than thrilled" about the Potter boy, since open hostility towards him could prove potentially disadvantageous to their social standing, as Draco spent a lot of his time away from Hogwarts talking badly of Harry and him being placed on the Quidditch Team as a first year.

[[File:Harry-potter2-movie-screencaps.com-2858.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lucius's confrontation with Arthur Weasley in Flourish and Blotts]]
Over the summer, [[Arthur Weasley]] began conducting raids on several wizarding households to confiscate Dark or illegally enchanted objects under his recently proposed [[Muggle Protection Act]]. Before his home could be raided, Lucius sold several of his more incriminating possessions at [[Borgin and Burkes]]. The items sold included several dangerous cursed objects of unknown effects. He then set in motion the old task that Voldemort assigned him which involved reopening the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. Although his master fell before the plan came to fruition, Lucius still had [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's Diary]] in his possession. 

Therefore, he could still make excellent use of it by not only purging Hogwarts of Muggle-borns but also by sabotaging Weasley's reputation, eliminating an incriminating Dark artefact all at once and hopefully even exploiting the forthcoming chaos to have Dumbledore removed from his position at the school. While in Flourish and Blotts Lucius got into a physical altercation with Arthur. Lucius then slipped the diary into [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]'s schoolbooks after meeting the Weasleys at [[Flourish and Blotts]] just before the start of the school term.

Only the Malfoys' [[house-elf]] [[Dobby]] was aware of the diary's true nature, but Lucius did not believe his servant would interfere since house-elves were unable to disobey the commands of their masters. Unbeknownst to him, Dobby took this to his advantage by attempting to warn [[Harry Potter]] against returning to Hogwarts.

Early this school year, Lucius bought the whole [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] [[Nimbus 2001]] broomsticks. The Nimbus 2001 was an highly advanced broom and the top of the line, therefore his gift was very expensive. He did this as bribe in order to get Draco instated as the team's [[Seeker]]. He was present at the match where Harry was being chased by a rogue Bludger.

[[File:Lucius-Fudge-Dumbledore.jpg|250px|thumb|Lucius sacking Dumbledore]]
Students, [[Mrs Norris|animals]], and [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|ghosts]] were systematically [[Petrification|petrified]] by the Basilisk that a possessed Ginny released as the diary's grip on her became gradually stronger. Lucius used the ensuing terror (as well as threats of [[Curse|cursing]] their families if they failed to cooperate) to influence the school's [[Hogwarts Board of Governors|Board of Governors]] to discredit and vote to dismiss [[Albus Dumbledore]] as Headmaster for his poor governance of the school. Harry followed to save Ginny and killed the Basilisk with [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's sword]]. He then destroyed the diary with a Basilisk fang, which (though he did not know it was a Horcrux at the time) also destroyed the piece of Voldemort's soul inside.

[[File:DumbleHarryLucius.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry with Dumbledore and Mr Malfoy after having defeated the Basilisk in the [[Chamber of Secrets]]]]
Harry proved Ginny's innocence and pointed an accusing finger at the true culprit — Lucius. Lucius challenged the boy to prove his claims, but Dumbledore who had returned to Hogwarts at the request of the governors, stated that would be impossible with the diary beyond repair. However, he warned Lucius not to sell any more of Voldemort's school things, as Arthur Weasley would likely trace them back to him. 

Subsequently (and adding insult to injury) Harry in gratitude to Dobby managed to trick Lucius into setting Dobby free. He accomplished this by wrapping the diary in his own sock before handing it back to Lucius. Dobby then caught the sock after Lucius carelessly tossed it aside; therefore, he was no longer forced into the servitude of the Malfoy family.

[[File:Dobby protecting Harry Potter.gif|250px|thumb|Lucius being magically blasted back by Dobby for attempting to assault Harry]]
In a fit of rage upon both losing his servant and being tricked by a much younger adversary, Lucius lost his normally controlled and calculating demeanour and tried to attack Harry. However, he was stopped by Dobby, who blasted him down a flight of steps. Lucius had no choice at that moment but to leave. While his role in the opening of the Chamber of Secrets could not be successfully proven, Lucius was ultimately stripped of his title as a Hogwarts school governor for threats against his eleven other colleagues. Despite his sacking, he still maintained strong ties with the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

====The Buckbeak case====
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|You'll have to put up a good strong defence, Hagrid. I'm sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe.|Rubeus Hagrid|Won't make no diff'rence! Them Disposal devils, they're all in Lucius Malfoy's pocket! Scared o' him!

[[File:B3C16M2 Buckbeak's execution.png|250px|thumb|left|Ministry officials arriving to execute Buckbeak, a direct result of Lucius's pettiness]]
During the [[1993–1994 school year]], Lucius's son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] was attacked by the [[hippogriff]] named [[Buckbeak]]. Draco was attacked after he provoked the hippogriff during a [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lesson. Lucius took the case to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]'s [[Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures]]. Once he was before the committee he insisted that the hippogriff be put to death. 

Buckbeak's owner, gamekeeper [[Rubeus Hagrid]], desperately tried to defend him. Hagrid had the assistance of [[Hermione Granger]], arguing that Buckbeak had been provoked by Draco and had attacked in self-defence. Despite his actions, Malfoy still won the case and Buckbeak was sentenced to death. However, before Ministry executioner [[Walden Macnair]] could carry out the execution, Buckbeak was saved by Harry and Hermione (with the help of Hermione's [[Time-Turner]]), and subsequently came to be owned by [[Sirius Black]].

====1994 Quidditch World Cup====
[[File:Malfoys in Top Box.jpg|250px|thumb|Lucius with his son at the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]]]
In 1994, Lucius attended the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] with his family, sitting in the [[Top Box|luxury box]] of [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]]. Though he was disgusted that Arthur Weasley was there in the Top Box with his children along with Harry and Hermione, Lucius and Arthur restrained themselves due to being in Fudge's presence. In the aftermath of the cup, Malfoy and some other former Death Eaters were involved in the torture and humiliation of the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] site manager of the stadium and his family, though it was not known at that time to the public and officials. He fled when the [[Dark Mark]] was launched into the sky.

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-screencaps.com-14816.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lucius in the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]] during the return of Lord Voldemort]]
When Lord Voldemort rose again in the summer of 1995, Malfoy returned to him on his summons. He arrived in Little Hangleton Graveyard and claimed that he had done everything he could all along to find Voldemort. He also insisted that he did everything to help him rise again. Voldemort believed that Malfoy had not truly renounced his old ways, but mildly doubted his loyalty because Malfoy had fled the Dark Mark at the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]].

Even though Harry witnessed Malfoy's declaration of loyalty to Voldemort, almost nobody in the Ministry believed him. Malfoy continued maintaining strong ties to very high places in the Ministry, most prominently in the form of financial support, as he had been doing in the past. This was key position that insured that the Death Eaters were privy to insider information regarding the goings on within the Ministry.

====Continued connection with the Ministry====
In 1995, after the trial of Harry Potter, Malfoy and Fudge encountered Harry, and it was implied that Malfoy was giving money to the Ministry. Malfoy appeared doing shady dealings with [[Cornelius Fudge]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]] just prior to Harry's trial.

[[File:Fudge Lucius.jpg|250px|thumb|Minister Fudge talking with Lucius at the Ministry]]
Malfoy's frequent excursions to meet with Fudge were also used as excuses to place the [[Imperius Curse]] on Ministry officials such as [[Broderick Bode]] and [[Order of the Phoenix]] member [[Sturgis Podmore]] on Voldemort's orders. These curses were placed in a bid to obtain [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy]]. However, these attempts were short-lived, as Bode failed to obtain the prophecy, therefore causing Voldemort to murder Bode, and Podmore was arrested for attempting to break into the [[Hall of Prophecy|Hall of Prophecies]].

Lucius also gave his support of the formation of [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three]], which was to create the post of [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]] for [[Dolores Umbridge]] to inspect the teachers' performance. During an interview about this post, he used this to discredit Dumbledore, under the false pretence of caring for the future of the school and fearing Dumbledore's "eccentric decisions".

====Battle of the Department of Mysteries====
{{Main|Battle of the Department of Mysteries}}
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Lucius|Potter, your race is run. Now hand me the [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] like a good boy....|Harry Potter|Let — let the others go, and I'll give it to you!|You are not in a position to bargain, Potter. You see, there are ten of us and only one of you ... or hasn't Dumbledore ever taught you how to count?|Lucius making threats during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-Prophecy.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Lucius insisting that Harry hand him the prophecy]]
After the failure of his previous attempts to obtain the prophecy, Voldemort successfully attempted to lure Harry to the [[Hall of Prophecy|Hall of Prophecies]] by planting a vision of his godfather being tortured in his mind. Malfoy — along with [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], her husband [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]] and her brother-in-law [[Rabastan Lestrange]], and fellow Death Eaters [[Augustus Rookwood]], [[Antonin Dolohov]], [[Nott]], [[Mulciber II|Mulciber]], [[Jugson]], [[Crabbe]], [[Walden Macnair]], and [[Avery II|Avery]] — was involved in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, when they were sent to pry the prophecy from Harry's hands. [[File:DeathEatersBattle.jpg|250px|thumb|Lucius and Dolohov battling the [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]
However, Harry and the five friends who accompanied him, all [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members, managed to hold off the Death Eaters until several members of the Order of the Phoenix arrived. Lucius and the other Death Eaters battled the Order members until Dumbldore arrived and they all were captured. All the Death Eaters (expect Bellatrix Lestrnage) were rounded up and bound together. At one point during the battle, Lucius was knocked unconscious by a [[Stunning Spell]] cast by [[Nymphadora Tonks]].

====Imprisonment and fall from grace====

They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!|Harry Potter calls out Lucius's wife [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] in [[Malkin|Madam Malkin]]'s [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions|shop]].|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:LuciusAzkaban.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Lucius incarcerated in [[Azkaban]]]]
Lucius's mission to retrieve the prophecy ultimately failed when [[Neville Longbottom]], under the influence of the [[Dancing Feet Spell]] cast by [[Antonin Dolohov]], accidentally broke the prophecy. Lucius was seen by a myriad of [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] officials called by [[Albus Dumbledore]] to the scene; now with irrefutable evidence pointing to his identity as a Death Eater, Lucius was promptly sent to Azkaban prison, as was the rest of the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] squad, the sole exception being [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], who escaped with Voldemort.

After the events in the Department of Mysteries, Voldemort mainly blamed Lucius for the failure. He blamed Lucius because Lucius had been the commander of Voldemort's small task force, even though Dumbledore himself had entered the fray.

Lucius Malfoy's failure at the [[Department of Mysteries]], combined with his accidentally destroying the part of Voldemort's soul contained within the diary of [[Tom Riddle]], resulted in his loss of any standing with the Dark Lord. Some believed (such as Albus Dumbledore) that he was safer in Azkaban than being free, as he was away from Voldemort's wrath. Marked as prisoner ᛟᚫ537, Lucius was sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban.

====Escape from Azkaban====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Lord Voldemort|No volunteers? Let's see ... Lucius, I see no reason for you to have a wand any more.|Lucius Malfoy|My Lord?|Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.|Voldemort stripping Lucius of his wand|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Meeting at Malfoy Manor DHF1.jpg|250px|thumb|Lucius attending the Death Eater meeting that took place in his manor]]
In the summer of 1997, nearly a year after being imprisoned, Lucius and all the other incarcerated [[Death Eaters]] escaped [[Azkaban]] with the help of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], who never bothered to get him out after all that time. It was mentioned that Lucius might have been secretly glad to have been incarcerated in Azkaban, as he was away from Voldemort and his terrible wrath. 

Voldemort was convinced to do so by [[Draco Malfoy]]'s success in the plot to assassinate [[Albus Dumbledore]]. In actuality, this was a further attempt to punish Lucius. Voldemort really did not think that Draco would succeed in this mission and would thereby dispose of Draco and possibly the other Malfoys as well.

[[File:DH1 Voldemort and Lucius Malfoy.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lord Voldemort disgracing Lucius during a Death Eater meeting]]
However, because Draco didn't kill Dumbledore himself, the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] were no longer held in high regard by the Dark Lord, who commandeered their home as his base of operations, and his favour fell on [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], Lucius's sister-in-law, and Severus Snape, Lucius's former protégé, since he killed Dumbledore. Voldemort openly mocked the family at a Death Eater meeting in the summer of 1997, taking Lucius's wand and deriding their relation to werewolf [[Remus Lupin]] through Narcissa's niece [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. In short, Lucius had become reduced to nothing more than a servant.

====Skirmish at Malfoy Manor====
{{Main|Skirmish at Malfoy Manor}}
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Lucius|Well, Draco? Is it? Is it Harry Potter?|Draco Malfoy|I can't — I can't be sure.|But look at him carefully, look! Come closer! Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv—|The Malfoy family attempting to identify Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
The Malfoys were desperate for a chance to be forgiven, and thus were excited when a group of [[Snatchers]] led by [[Fenrir Greyback]] brought Harry Potter and his friends to the Manor in the spring of 1998. Lucius pressed his reluctant and fearful son to identify Harry, and identified [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] as one of [[Arthur Weasley]]'s sons. However, Draco denied knowing who Harry was.[[File:Malfoy family DH1.jpg|250px|thumb|Lucius preparing to summon the Dark Lord after the discovery of [[Harry Potter]]]]He then argued with his sister-in-law about who would be the one to call Voldemort with their [[Dark Mark]]s, but they held off when Bellatrix noticed [[Sword of Gryffindor|Gryffindor's Sword]], which she had believed to be in her [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] [[Lestrange Vault|vault]], among their possessions. Subsequently, Bellatrix tortured [[Hermione Granger]] for information about the sword with the [[Cruciatus Curse]] while the others were taken to the cellar downstairs.

After Hermione lied about the sword being a copy and [[Griphook]] went along with her story, Bellatrix signalled [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], but [[Dobby]], the Malfoys' former house-elf, came to the rescue of the prisoners. Harry and Ron ran back upstairs, and the former stunned Lucius and [[Fenrir Greyback|Greyback]]. After their escape, the Malfoys and Bellatrix were severely punished by Voldemort and were confined to the manor.

====Malfoy Manor massacre====
{{Quote|The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified: [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and Lucius Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup — |Voldemort ruthlessly massacres the Goblins with the [[Killing Curse]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Slaughter at Malfoy Manor.png|250x250px|thumb|left|The result of the massacre at Malfoy Manor]]
Lucius was present when Voldemort was informed by several goblins from Gringotts that the [[Trio]] had robbed the [[Lestrange Vault]]. This caused Voldemort to panic, and when he was informed that [[Hufflepuff's Cup|a small golden cup]] had been stolen, he flew into a rage. Realising at that moment that Harry was hunting his Horcruxes, Voldemort unleashed the [[Elder Wand]] while [[Nagini]] watched. The rest of the witnesses fled, Lucius and even Bellatrix were pushing others aside in their haste to leave the room.

The Dark Lord smote each [[goblin]] on the floor in their turn until he was left alone amongst the dead with his followers. His followers were slowly and fearfully approaching the carnage.
====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
{{Dialogue|Lucius|My Lord... please... my son...|Voldemort|If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins...|Lucius begging Voldemort to let him find Draco|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Death eaters-dhp2.jpg|250px|thumb|Lucius beckoning his son to join him and Narcissa]]
By the time of the Battle of Hogwarts, Lucius showed that he was more concerned with his son's safety than [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s cause, begging to be permitted to find him when the fighting began. [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] lied directly to Voldemort for Harry's sake when he informed her that [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] was still alive, and she and Lucius ran through the crowd, "''not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son''".

Lucius was present in for [[Harry Potter]]'s final defeat of Lord Voldemort. Following Voldemort's defeat, Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco sat in the [[Great Hall]] during the celebrations, looking unsure that they belonged there.

===Later life {{C|1998–}}===
Lucius and Draco's crimes were forgiven due to their abandonment of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] and his cause, and Narcissa's lie to the Dark Lord that saved [[Harry Potter]]'s life in the [[Forbidden Forest]] in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. None of them served time in [[Azkaban]] due to the evidence he provided against fellow [[Death Eaters]] and his help to ensure the capture of many of Voldemort's followers who had fled into hiding. However, the revelation of their previous loyalty to Voldemort had invariably destroyed Lucius's prized and precious reputation and few people would forget the Malfoy family's previous loyalties. 

Lucius would eventually gain a grandson, [[Scorpius Malfoy]], after Draco married [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]]. Because of Astoria's change of view regarding blood purity after the war, Lucius and Narcissa found her to be a somewhat disappointing daughter-in-law despite her pure-blood heritage. According to Draco, Lucius was frequently telling Astoria that he wanted grandchildren to continue on the family line, despite Draco telling her otherwise.

Lucius still enjoyed collecting Dark artefacts, particularly ones that no one else had. [[Theodore Nott]] worked for him and they created a prototype for a new [[Time-Turner]], having decided the ones created by the Ministry were unsuitable and, having been destroyed, unavailable. The prototype was hindered by the five minute rule, but they then found a way to create another Time-Turner which would enable Lucius to travel back in time years, as he had hoped. However, he never used it which led Draco to believe that he actually preferred a world without Voldemort. The Time-Turner he created was kept by Draco, and used to save Scorpius and his [[Albus Potter|friend]] who were trapped in the past.

==Physical appearance==
[[File:Lucius Malfoy Headshot.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Lucius Malfoy in [[1996]]]]
Lucius had a pale, pointed face, with pale blond hair and cold grey eyes. He often carried a [[Lucius Malfoy's walking stick|walking stick]] with a snake head that contained [[Lucius Malfoy's wand|his wand]]. After spending a year in the wizarding prison of Azkaban, possibly suffering the horrors of the Dementors' presence, his looks suffered greatly because of it, his skin taking on a yellowish and waxy look, and his eyes sunken and shadowed. His voice was also quite hoarse. 

Later that year, after having been a victim of the Dark Lord's wrath upon Harry Potter's escape from the Manor, Lucius's looks took a turn for the worse, as he seemed ragged, and he carried traces of his punishment, meaning he might have looked beaten and bruised. It is likely that his looks might have improved upon the fall of his former Master once he returned to everyday life. As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm; this had faded to a mere scar upon Voldemort's death.

His son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] resembled him strongly. It was stated that his grandson, [[Scorpius Malfoy]], resembled Draco, meaning that Lucius and his grandson also had a resemblance.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Good lord Arthur. What did you did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely [[The Burrow|your house]] wouldn't have fetched this much?|Lucius displaying contempt towards [[Arthur Weasley]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
As pretty much the embodiment of wealth and influence in the wizarding community, Lucius Malfoy took great pride in his aristocratic stature, and viewed himself as superior to [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s and [[Muggle-born]]s, although his views on [[half-blood]]s were likely more tempered as many half-bloods appear on the Malfoy family tree. He was also a very shrewd, opportunistic social climber who was good at controlling others, but behind his veneer of respectability, he treated people cruelly. He callously utilised eleven-year old [[Ginevra Weasley]] in an attempt to both discredit [[Arthur Weasley|her father]] in the Ministry, and remove Albus Dumbledore from his position as Headmaster of Hogwarts. This attempt would have resulted in her death if Harry Potter had not intervened.

[[File:Lucius malfoy.JPG|250px|thumb|Lucius's dangerous temper as he attempted to curse [[Harry Potter]]]]
Lucius could be intelligent and manipulative when he needed to be, allowing him to gain respect and the good will of high-ranking individuals through his fortune and family name. He even had influence over Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge. Lucius's constant donations to important establishments were actually nothing more than bribing Fudge for classified information, delaying laws, and receiving undeserved rewards and recognitions.

While putting much effort into maintaining an appearance of respectability, Lucius's slick demeanour did little to hide his self-serving nature. He had no qualms about appealing to whichever side would be more beneficial to his social advancement. He was never unconditionally loyal because he didn't want to be put in a negative light with people on either end. During the Quidditch World Cup, he anonymously participated in the lowly torturing of Muggles but fled when the Dark Mark was cast in the sky. 

In fact, rather than going to find Lord Voldemort when he lost all his powers in the first place, he instead pretended to have seen the error of his ways and tried to ingratiate himself to the Ministry of Magic. He claimed that he was always alert for Voldemort's return but when Voldemort pointed out that he had fled from the Dark Mark, Lucius was instantly silenced. Despite this, he did attempt to go through with Voldemort's plan of using his old school diary to open the Chamber of Secrets, not realising that the diary contained a piece of his master's soul (although Lucius was more focused on ridding himself of an incriminating piece of dark magic when the Ministry was conducting searches).

However, in spite of his ruthless and prejudiced nature, one of Lucius's more redeeming traits was that he was very loving and devoted towards his family, especially caring greatly for his wife and son. He and Narcissa were indulgent and protective of their only child, though Lucius also demonstrated that he had expectations for his son, in one instance berating him for being beaten academically by Hermione Granger. In the end, along with Narcissa, he demonstrated that his family was more important to him than serving Voldemort, especially after Voldemort lost both the respect and trust he once had from the Malfoys. Lucius's love for Draco and Narcissa also allowed him to overcome his more self-serving side as he charged straight into the thick of battle during the siege on Hogwarts in an attempt to find Draco, eventually locating him after Voldemort was finally defeated and the battle came to an end.

Despite his love for his son, Lucius became disappointed in Draco for losing his value in [[pure-blood supremacy]] after the [[Second Wizarding War]], and for marrying [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]], who underwent similar changes to Draco's. Father and son had an argument for Draco's willingness to let the Malfoy bloodline end with him to preserve Astoria's [[Blood malediction|frail body]], showing that Lucius still maintained his belief in pure-blood supremacy over the well-being of a human being, and that the mistreatment he received from the Second Wizarding War did little to change his opportunistic and bigoted personality. 

He even employed [[Theodore Nott]] to create a "true" [[Time-Turner]], a dangerous device that would give him the potential to go back in time to avert Voldemort's demise. Yet due to the fact that he never used it, it shows Lucius remained inclined to the dark side, as was seen by his creating and keeping such a dangerous and illegal device, and passing it on to his son. However, it can be also inferred that Lucius didn't have any intention at all to bring back his former master, as Draco later reflected that Lucius seemed to like a world without Voldemort.

==Magical abilities and skills==
[[File:OOTP Death Chamber Sirius Harry Antonin Lucius.gif|245px|thumb|Lucius, along with Dolohov, duelling Sirius Black and Harry Potter during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]
{{Quote|It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter. Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.|Lucius's fondness for martial magic|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Being one of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s inner circle and, up until the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], one of his most trusted and valued allies, Lucius was obviously a very powerful and experienced [[Wizardkind|wizard]].
*'''[[Love]]''': Despite his cold and ruthless nature, Lucius was one of the only [[Death Eaters]] in Voldemort's inner circle who was capable of feeling genuine love. Lucius cared deeply about his family, especially [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] and [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]. In the end, his love for his family drove him to abandon Voldemort and search for Draco, especially after Voldemort refused his offer to stop the battle in order for him to search for Draco while Voldemort searched for Harry Potter. His abandonment of Voldemort led to him avoiding another sentence in Azkaban along with his family.
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': As a high-ranking Death Eater, Lucius was highly familiar and skilled with all kinds of dark magic and with the casting of [[dark charm]]s, being an accomplished [[Dark Wizard]]. He was able to recognise the effects of such unfriendly spells on sight. When [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] were captured by [[Snatchers]] and brought to [[Malfoy Manor]], for example, Lucius was able to quickly identify the cause of the former's appearance as the result of a [[Stinging Jinx]], even though his comrades present could not. The extent of his power and skill as a Dark Wizard was shown by how he was able to successfully perform the [[Unforgivable Curses]], which required tremendous skill and genuine malice, as shown by his proficiency at the [[Imperius Curse]], successfully placing [[Sturgis Podmore]] and [[Broderick Bode]] under control, which allowed him to carry out his master's orders. He was also known to enjoy the torturing of Muggles with dark magic, along with his fellow Death Eaters. Furthermore, Lucius owned an impressive collection of numerous dark magical artefacts and [[curse]]d objects in his home, many of which he likely purchased from [[Borgin and Burkes]], being a frequent customer there, and was also able to understand them thoroughly and interact with them. Indeed, even Voldemort trusted him to take care of his [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|diary]], one of his [[Horcrux]]es, speaking for his confidence in Lucius's ability to manage dark objects, although his neglect and misuse of this item ultimately led to its destruction, much to his master's fury. He also used [[dark charm]]s (such as the [[jinx]] ''[[Dangling Jinx|Levicorpus]]'') when he lead fellow [[Death Eaters]] in torturing Muggles at the [[Reappearance of the Dark Mark|riot at the World Cup]].
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Lucius was a highly skilled duellist, though not as aggressive as some of his fellow [[Death Eaters]], instead favouring a more elegant, refined technique when he engaged an adversary, and generally demonstrating great form in his duelling style. A veteran of the [[First Wizarding War]], Lucius fought the enemies of the Dark Lord during his former master's first rise to power and, as his most senior lieutenant at the time, led fractions of the dark forces into battle. Having held his own against trained [[Auror]]s and members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] alike during the historical conflict, Lucius survived the war and were ultimately able to evade capture until after Voldemort's fall from power. An impressive feat, given the fact that he and the rest of his allies were up against the likes of [[Alastor Moody]], who filled half the cells in [[Azkaban]] with those Lucius fought alongside with and how the [[Head of Department|Head]] of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] of the day, [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch]], authorised the [[Auror Office]] to [[Curse-to-kill|kill rather than capture]], and Lucius consequently proved capable of emerging from combat situations that were no-holds-barred as well as fending off people who simply sought to arrest or capture him. In spite of not having seen action for about thirteen years, Lucius had maintained his skill at martial magic; successfully fought the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] officials that tried to apprehend him and his comrades during the [[Reappearance of the Dark Mark|Riot at the Quidditch World Cup]], although he, like them, fled when the [[Dark Mark]] was sent skywards by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|one of their fellows]]. He was also notably the only Death Eater (apart from [[Severus Snape]]) who had enough confidence in his own abilities to stand up to [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. During the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Lucius showed proficient reflexes in deflecting Harry Potter's [[Stunning Spell]] with relative ease, contrasting at least two of his comrades who broke their ranks to avoid the ones from his friends. Shortly afterwards, he blocked another such spell from [[Nymphadora Tonks]], one of the [[Auror]]s in the [[Order of the Phoenix]] that had arrived to rescue the students that he and the other dark wizards present were targeting. In the same battle, he also stood his ground against [[Remus Lupin]], until the arrival of [[Albus Dumbledore]] saw him rounded up with his peers.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Lucius was capable of casting offensive [[spell]]s while duelling non-verbally, showing a great amount of skill in this field, given the high level of difficulty required in the casting of non-verbal spells, a further testament to his skills as a powerful wizard.
*'''Intellect''': Lucius was a rather astute and wily man, having been a model student during his time as a student and even made a [[Prefect]] at his fifth year, a position bestowed upon academic high-achievers that had proven themselves capable, both in class and out. As an adult, his political acumen was such that it enabled him to effectively influence matters of state; being persuasive enough in conversation to win the respect of high-ranking bureaucrats such as [[Dolores Umbridge]], and the goodwill of various politicians, whom he was able to convince to make changes that favoured Lucius's own agenda over that of other important people. Indeed, throughout the [[First Wizarding War]] and during the early stages of the [[Second Wizarding War|Second]], Lucius was able to effectively balance his roles as both among the most prominent and politically influential individuals at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], ''and'' the [[Tom Riddle|Dark Lord]]'s second-in-command, while also possessing the foresight to prepare a contingency plan on the off-chance that he fell under suspicion of being involved with the Dark Lord by ensuring that he was owed favours by people in high places and could call in to collect them when necessary. After the war, Lucius retained his influence at the Ministry, even becoming a close advisor of the [[Minister for Magic]] of the time, [[Cornelius Fudge]].
*'''Acting skills''': Lucius was a capable actor, having been able to successfully pretend to be on the side of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] during the [[First Wizarding War]] while he was actually the [[Tom Riddle|Dark Lord]]'s second-in-command, and, even after being captured, managed to convince most of the Ministry that he had been an unwilling pawn and helped the [[Death Eaters]] against his will. He was also able to successfully pretend that he had no idea at all who was behind the [[Chamber of Secrets]] attacks while it was actually he who caused it and even when confronted by Dumbledore over this fact, Lucius was able to keep his emotion in check to avoid a confrontation with [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] he most certainly knew he would not win. In the beginning of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Lucius was once again able to act as apparent ally to the Ministry while once more serving the Dark Lord, carrying out several acts of covert coercion in an attempt to steal the [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|Prophecy of the Chosen One]] without being noticed and was only exposed upon his capture in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].
*'''Leadership skills''': Lucius was a talented leader even in his younger years, as shown by how he was able to successfully keep his fellow [[Slytherin]]s in check as a [[Prefect]]. Throughout the majority of the [[First Wizarding War]] and in the beginning of [[Second Wizarding War|the second]], Lucius's leadership skills made him the [[Tom Riddle|Dark Lord]]'s second-in-command. During the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Lucius displayed his leadership by remaining calm and focused on the mission even when faced with the unexpected situation when [[Harry Potter]] and [[Dumbledore's Army|his friends]] made a run for it and split up to confuse them, which he swiftly handled by quickly pairing up the Death Eaters under his command so that they would be pursuing all the teenagers at the same time, leading to the [[Death Eaters]] rather quick capture of them all, and then leading them against the [[Order of the Phoenix]], where they even got the upper hand until the arrival of Dumbledore; which led to the swift defeat of him and his allies. In addition to being unaffected by the mockeries of his cause and insults to the Dark Lord, he showed that if the objective was sufficiently important, he would not hesitate in leaving fallen comrades behind, focusing instead on seeing Lord Voldemort's orders through to the very end.
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Lucius was skilled in the brewing of potions. While in school at Hogwarts, Lucius was noted by [[Horace Slughorn]] to be proficient in [[Potions (class)|potions]] and his talent in potion-making even earned him a place among Slughorn's elite [[Slug Club]]. Furthermore, Lucius owned a rather impressive repertoire of various [[poison]]s, showing he likely had knowledge of such substances.
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most accomplished adult wizards, Lucius was capable of apparating at will. After the Return of the Dark Lord, he Apparated to the Little Hangleton Graveyard to witness the rebirth of his master, along with many other Death Eaters.

==Possessions==
[[File:Lucius Malfoy Death Eater Mask.png|200px|thumb|Lucius's Death Eater mask]]
[[File:Lucius Malfoy wand.png|thumb|Lucius's wand and cane]]
*'''[[Lucius Malfoy's wand|Wand]]''': Lucius owned a wand which he kept in his walking stick. This wand was passed down through generations in the [[Malfoy family]].
*'''[[Lucius Malfoy's second wand|Second Wand:]] '''Lucius owned a second wand that he used during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] to replace the one that was destroyed.
*'''[[Lucius Malfoy's walking stick|Enchanted Cane]]''': Lucius owned a walking stick that was enchanted with the shield charm to protect him from spells. His wand was hidden within the stick for sneak attacks, so he could block and cast [[spell]]s at the same time. The cane was also ornamented with a snake head at the top. This ornamentation was broken off by Voldemort in the [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor]], when Voldemort forced Lucius to give him his wand, under the assumption that another's wand but not his own can kill Harry Potter.
*'''[[Poison]]s''': In [[1992]] he was seen by Harry Potter selling [[Dark Arts|dark]] poisons at [[Borgin and Burkes]] because the ministry was conducting raids on private homes.
*'''[[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's Diary]]''': When he became a Death Eater, Lord Voldemort trusted Lucius with a [[Horcrux]]. However, Lucius attempted to use it in a way to discredit his enemies, the Weasley family, by slipping it into the luggage of Ginevra Weasley. This culminated in a turn of events where the diary was destroyed by [[Harry Potter]] in the [[Chamber of Secrets]].
*'''[[Time-Turner]]''': As an avid collector of powerful artefacts, Lucius had [[Theodore Nott]] create a new Time-Turner which was not restricted by the safety boundary of five hours as was created by the Ministry, nor by the boundary of the five minute restriction created by Nott's prototype. The improved Time-Turner gleamed gold and could travel back to any time for a long duration. Lucius passed it down to Draco. Lucius and Draco kept it secret as the Ministry would have sent them to Azkaban for having such a dangerous artefact. Lucius never actually used it, and Draco believed his father actually preferred the world without Voldemort in it.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====Parents====
Although not much is known about Lucius's parents, it is known that they were both pure-blood. His father, [[Abraxas Malfoy|Abraxas]], died of a case of [[Dragon Pox]], when he was very old. He was also a friend of [[Horace Slughorn]]. It is unknown when Lucius's mother died, but it is possible that she was not alive during the [[Second Wizarding War]].

====Wife and Son====
{{Dialogue a-b|Bellatrix|[[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|That]] was not my fault!

[[File:Narcissa Malfoy.png|240px|thumb|left|[[Narcissa Malfoy]], his wife]]

Lucius and his wife, Narcissa, appeared to have a close and affectionate relationship. They both enjoyed being members of the social elite of the [[wizarding world]] and spoiling their only child, [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]. Lucius acquiesced to his wife's wishes when she wanted their son to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], rather than [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]]. Narcissa was very upset when her husband was briefly imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] and became highly defensive when others mentioned it. In [[1997]], when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] took over [[Malfoy Manor]] and demanded that Lucius give him his wand, he looked to Narcissa, and only when she touched his wrist, which gestured him to be calm, then he turned it over.

[[File:Draco-Malfoy-promo-draco-and-slytherin-22383941-1920-2560.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Draco Malfoy]], his son and only child]]

While both Lucius and Narcissa spoiled their son, Lucius was the more demanding parent. Regardless, he spoiled Draco with everything from unlimited freedom to money, and personally purchased broomsticks for the entire [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] when Draco was made [[Seeker]]. He was also openly critical of Draco's school marks being lower than those of [[Hermione Granger]], a [[Muggle-born]] witch, reproving Draco for his lack of effort to show her up. Draco looked up to his father, often boasting about his influence and emulating him. He was furious with [[Harry Potter]] after the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], blaming him for getting Lucius incarcerated.

Draco was terrified that his parents would be punished for his failure to assassinate [[Albus Dumbledore]] on [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s orders, and appeared to be close to accepting Dumbledore's offer to keep them safe before [[Severus Snape]] interceded and killed the Headmaster. Lucius also cared far more about Draco than about his life as a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], as he was begging Voldemort during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] to allow him to go search for Draco. Once it resumed, neither Lucius nor Narcissa fought at all, but instead went desperately searching for their son.

In [[2006]], Lucius had a grandson, [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]] through Draco and his wife, [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]]. Lucius didn't think highly of Astoria, as she raised their grandson Scorpius with a more tolerant view on Muggles. It is unknown what kind of relationship Lucius and Scorpius had, given Astoria's nurturing. Scorpius also resembled Lucius physically, as he resembled Draco, too. However, Lucius's relationship with Draco seemed to have been slightly more strained since Astoria's marriage into the family, as Draco made it clear he was willing to let the Malfoy bloodline end with him in order to preserve the health of his wife's frail body, to which Lucius protested.

===Arthur Weasley===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Lucius|Dear me, what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?|Arthur|We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,|Clearly. The company you keep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower.|Lucius and Arthur Weasley arguing in [[Flourish and Blotts]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Arthur Weasley profile.jpg|235px|thumb|left|[[Arthur Weasley]], his arch-rival]]
Lucius and Arthur Weasley despised each other, often exchanging insults when they met, and even getting into a fistfight on at least one occasion. Lucius disdained the [[Weasley family]] for its poverty and so-called [[blood traitor]] status; while the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] prized their [[pure-blood]] heritage, the Weasleys accepted [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s and [[Muggle-born]]s. He and Arthur apparently clashed multiple times over this at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. 

When Arthur proposed the [[Muggle Protection Act]] in [[1992]], Lucius was furious to the point of trying to sabotage Arthur by placing an [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|old diary]] of [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]]'s on Arthur's eleven-year-old daughter, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], endangering her life as well as those of Muggle-born [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] students, as this led to the opening of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. 

Also, Arthur never believed Lucius's claim that he had been under the [[Imperius Curse]] during the [[First Wizarding War]], thereby indicating that their enmity likely dates back to their younger years.

===Severus Snape===
{{Quote|Lucius always spoke highly of you.|[[Dolores Umbridge]] to Severus Snape|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}} 
[[File:Severus Snape OOTP.jpg|220x220px|thumb|[[Severus Snape]], his friend]]
Lucius was the first person in Hogwarts who offered kindness to Severus Snape and later took him on as a protégé during their [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] days. Lucius welcomed him into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] when Severus was sorted there and Lucius was a [[prefect]], and as part of a [[Gang of Slytherins|group]] of future [[Death Eaters]]. It is also possible that Lucius protected him from bullies, such as [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and [[Sirius Black]], as the latter seemed to despise him. Lucius continued to think and speak highly of Severus later in life, and Severus seemed to favour [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] as a student in his [[Potions (class)|Potions]] class, leading [[Sirius Black]] to once acidly comment that Severus was Lucius's lapdog. 

The fact that [[Narcissa Malfoy]] went to Severus for help when Lucius was in [[Azkaban]] and Draco had been given a dangerous mission by Voldemort demonstrated the trust and respect the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] had for Severus. Severus, on his part, was the only Death Eater who continued to treat Lucius kindly after his fall from favour and was the one who convinced Voldemort to free him from Azkaban. It is unknown how Lucius reacted when he learnt of Snape's death and his true loyalties to Dumbledore, though it is possible that he was saddened by the death of his old friend and may have been sympathetic towards Snape due to his own disillusionment from the Death Eaters.

===Bellatrix Lestrange===
{{Quote|I TOLD YOU, NO! If you smash it — !|Lucius's anger at Bellatrix during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Bellatrix Lestrange promo.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]], his sister-in-law]]

Lucius did not seem to have very much respect for Bellatrix Lestrange, his sister-in-law, as the rest of the [[Death Eaters]] did. Bellatrix was a fanatically loyal Death Eater, who also fought for [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in the [[First Wizarding War|First]] and the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Lucius was antagonistic with Bellatrix due to usurping his place within the Death Eater ranks despite the fact she had been imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for fourteen years, unlike Lucius. Their differences in loyalty in the Dark Lord also fuelled their antagonism for each other.

When Bellatrix wanted to kill [[Harry Potter]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Lucius restrained her. After the battle, Bellatrix told Narcissa that it was Lucius's fault that she couldn't give Voldemort [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|the Prophecy]]. When Draco was made a Death Eater, she trained Draco herself In [[1997]], Bellatrix stayed with Lucius at his house, as she wanted to come closer to Voldemort, who was also staying there. Bellatrix and Lucius also fought together during the skirmish at Malfoy Manor, where they argued about who would call Voldemort when they caught Harry Potter. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Bellatrix was eventually killed by [[Molly Weasley]], although Lucius's reaction to her death is unknown. 

===Dobby===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Lucius|Come Dobby, I said ''come''.|Dobby|Master has given Dobby a sock. Master gave it to Dobby.|What's that? What did you say?|Got a sock. Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby — Dobby is ''free''|Lucius unknowingly liberating Dobby of his servitude|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Dobby.jpg|220x220px|thumb|[[Dobby]], his former [[House-elf]] who he treated abusively]]

Dobby was Lucius's [[house-elf]]. Lucius treated Dobby with cruelty and abuse and was very sadistic with him. Dobby feared Lucius, but did everything Lucius ordered him. In [[1993]], [[Harry Potter]] freed Dobby by making Lucius give him a sock. Lucius became very angry and attempted to kill Harry. The last time Lucius saw Dobby was in [[1998]], when Dobby came to [[Malfoy Manor]] to rescue Harry Potter and his friends. Dobby was eventually killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], and it is unknown how Lucius reacted when he learned about his death. 

===Lord Voldemort===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Voldemort|I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late… What is it about my presence in your home that displeases you, Lucius?|Lucius|Nothing – nothing, my Lord!|Such ''lies'', Lucius.|Voldemort and Lucius in Malfoy Manor in [[1997]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Voldemort1998.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], his former master]]

Lucius was one of Lord Voldemort's most trusted and high-ranking [[Death Eaters]], serving him in both the [[First Wizarding War|First]] and [[Second Wizarding War]]s. Voldemort gave his [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|diary]] [[Horcrux]] to Lucius to retain. Upon his rebirth in [[1995]], Voldemort questioned Lucius's loyalty, since he had never tried to find the Dark Lord after his fall in [[1981]]. Voldemort accepted Lucius's explanations and exultations of devotion, and entrusted Lucius with the task of obtaining [[prophecy|a prophecy]] concerning him and [[Harry Potter]]. 

Later however, Lucius selfishly throwing away the diary Horcrux, his failure in retrieving the Prophecy, and subsequent imprisonment in [[Azkaban]] made him and his family lose any favour in Voldemort's eyes, and the Dark Lord may gave Lucius's son a nearly impossible task to punish Lucius.

Although he [[Azkaban escapes#1997|broke Lucius out of Azkaban]] in [[1997]], along with many other Death Eaters, Voldemort treated him with disdain, taking over his home and [[Lucius Malfoy's wand|his wand]], and mocking the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] for their relation to a [[Remus Lupin|werewolf]] through [[Nymphadora Tonks|Narcissa's niece]]. Lucius was desperate to regain his master's favour, but the opportunity for that came with the capture of Harry Potter in the spring of [[1998]] and, unfortunately for him, ended in disaster; Harry and his friends [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|escaped]], and the Malfoys were severely punished. By the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Lucius had abandoned his loyalty to Voldemort in order to protect his family, and was pardoned for his crimes due to his last-minute defection.

Draco mentioned many years later that Lucius never wanted to use the "true" [[Time-Turner]] to save Voldemort, as he probably preferred a world without him, suggesting that even Lucius despised the Dark Lord in the end, particularly due to the ill treatment Voldemort had given to the Malfoy family at their later half of their Death Eater services.

===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Quote|Father's always said old Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place. |Draco Malfoy discusses his father's derisive opinion of Albus Dumbledore.|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|220x220px|thumb|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his enemy]]
Lucius Malfoy had a strong dislike of Albus Dumbledore. This is due to two reasons – Dumbledore believed in Muggle rights which contradicted Malfoy's pure blood supremacist beliefs. In addition, Lucius was a Death Eater, so he believed that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was a much more powerful wizard than Dumbledore. Lucius always believed that Dumbledore becoming [[Headmaster]] was the worst thing that happened to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Dumbledore was Headmaster at least part of Lucius` schooltime as Lucius was in his sixth or seventh year when the Marauders started at Hogwarts and then Dumbledore was already Headmaster.

{{Quote|Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension — you'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.|Lucius announcing Dumbledore's removal from office|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
In [[1992]], Lucius Malfoy was indirectly responsible for the second opening of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. This was an attempt to discredit [[Arthur Weasley]] but Lucius also wanted to include Dumbledore by using the excuse of blaming him for doing nothing to stop the Chamber's opening. Lucius abused his position as a [[Hogwarts Board of Governors|Hogwarts Governor]] and threatened the other Governors to vote for Dumbledore's [[Order of Suspension|suspension]] after several attacks on Hogwarts students. However, when [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] was taken into the Chamber to lure [[Harry Potter]], the other Governors decided to face Malfoy and Dumbledore was reinstated. Lucius was furious that Dumbledore dared to return to Hogwarts to help Harry successfully save Ginny, but Dumbledore was aware that Lucius had threatened the other Governors. Consequently, Lucius was sacked as a Hogwarts Governor.

In the following years, Lucius continued to dislike Dumbledore and cause trouble for him. When Voldemort was resurrected in [[1995]], Lucius returned to his service. As the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] was refusing to believe Dumbledore about Voldemort's return, they started a smear campaign to discredit him. Lucius contributed to this smear campaign by describing Dumbledore as "eccentric" for his past choice of teachers including the [[werewolf]] [[Remus Lupin]], [[half-giant]] [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and ex-[[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody]]. Later that year, Lucius participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and fought against the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. However, he was arrested and sent to [[Azkaban]].

Dumbledore believed that Lucius would feel "safe" in [[Azkaban]] because Voldemort was furious at Lucius's failure in the [[Department of Mysteries]], and offered to protect Lucius along with Narcissa when Draco threatened to murder the headmaster. It is unknown how Lucius reacted when he learned of Dumbledore's death.

===Harry Potter===
{{Quote|You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days, Harry Potter. They were meddlesome fools, too.|Lucius coldly threatening Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Harry Potter.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]], his enemy]]
Lucius was the father of Draco Malfoy, Harry's school bully. During their first years at Hogwarts, Lucius discouraged their rivalry, feeling it wouldn't reflect well on them to be on poor terms with such a famous person. When Lucius first met Harry in [[Flourish and Blotts]] in [[1992]], he pretended to be polite to him.

After Harry succeeded in killing the [[basilisk]] in the [[Chamber of Secrets]], he confronted Lucius about his suspicions on how Ginny obtained the diary at the beginning of the year and then tricked him into freeing his own servant [[Dobby]]. Lucius was furious and from that point on, treated him with cool contempt.{{Quote|You've lost me my servant, boy!|Lucius attempting to assault Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}Lucius was a little bit more tactful around Harry than other Death Eaters (such as Bellatrix Lestrange) depending on the circumstances. However, Lucius did not openly declare himself against him until after Lord Voldemort took control of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]].

During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], the Malfoy family switched sides, meaning they were forgiven for their crimes. Draco, while he did not necessarily become "friends" with Harry, ultimately made peace with him. Lucius did the same as well, or at least simply decided to leave Harry and his friends and [[Potter family|family]] alone.

===Cornelius Fudge===
{{Dialogue a-b|Lucius Malfoy|Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?|Cornelius Fudge|Certainly, this way Lucius|Lucius's sycophantic relationship with Fudge|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}} 
[[File:Cornelius Fudge 2.jpg|220x220px|thumb|[[Cornelius Fudge]], his former associate]]

Cornelius Fudge was easily and strongly swayed by money and power. As a result, he favoured people like Lucius Malfoy. Malfoy influenced and likely bribed Cornelius Fudge many times during the latter's tenure as [[Minister for Magic]], in return receiving favours such as delays in laws and given classified information. In the summer of [[1994]], Fudge invited Malfoy to occupy the top box with him at the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] final, thanks to his "generous" donations to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]].

In [[1995]], Lucius returned to Voldemort, but Fudge denied Voldemort's rebirth and insisted that Malfoy had switched sides, and the wealthy Malfoy continued to work with the Ministry. They met after [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|Harry Potter's disciplinary hearing]] and went upstairs to Fudge's office, where Harry suspected Lucius gave gold to Fudge. Malfoy's frequent visits to Fudge also may have given him opportunity to put Ministry workers (such as [[Broderick Bode]] and [[Sturgis Podmore]]) under the [[Imperius Curse]] to attempt to steal [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|a prophecy]] concerning Harry and Voldemort.

After the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Fudge was forced to believe that Voldemort had indeed returned, and all the [[Death Eaters]] who took part on the battle (with the exception of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]) were sentenced to [[Azkaban]], among them being Lucius. After being imprisoned, Lucius lost his job and influence at the Ministry; Fudge, having been blind to Lucius's true intentions until it was too late, also lost his career and popularity as well.

===Rubeus Hagrid===
{{Dialogue a-b|Rubeus Hagrid|What're you doin' here? Get outta [[Hagrid's Hut|my house]]!|Lucius Malfoy|My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your — er — d'you call this a house?|[[Rubeus Hagrid]] and Lucius demonstrating mutual contempt|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Rubeus Hagrid.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|[[Rubeus Hagrid]], an enemy]]
Rubeus Hagrid was not on good terms with the [[Malfoy family]]. He was disgusted with their pure blood supremacy, their bullying of [[Muggle-born]]s and [[blood traitor]]s, their allegiance to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and their disrespect to [[Albus Dumbledore]], whom Hagrid was fiercely loyal to. In turn, the Malfoys disliked Hagrid, referring to him as an "oaf".

In particular, Hagrid disliked Lucius. In [[1992]], Hagrid had to separate [[Arthur Weasley]] and Lucius Malfoy from fighting in [[Flourish and Blotts]]. During the [[1992–1993 school year]], the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was opened. Lucius was indirectly responsible for the Chamber's opening. However, Hagrid was blamed because he had been framed by [[Tom Riddle]] for the Chamber's first opening fifty years before. As a result, Hagrid was arrested as a precautionary measure by [[Cornelius Fudge]]. Lucius was present at Hagrid's arrest, although Hagrid reacted angrily to his presence and ordered him to get out of his house. 

Lucius mocked Hagrid by wondering how he called his small hut a "house". Lucius was only present at Hagrid's arrest because he had to inform [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] that he and the other governors had voted on his suspension. Hagrid saw through Lucius and shouted at him accusing him of threatening the other governors. Lucius's response was to mock Hagrid's temper and advising him not to shout at Azkaban guards like that. This instance proved that Hagrid did not trust Lucius. Lucius described Dumbledore's decision to employ Hagrid as a teacher as "eccentric".

In [[1993]], Lucius's son, Draco, was injured by Hagrid's [[Hippogriff]] [[Buckbeak]]. Lucius was furious and complained to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. At Buckbeak's trial, Lucius was the witness for the prosecution. Hagrid desperately tried to defend Buckbeak but he lost due to Lucius's influence at the Ministry. Buckbeak was sentenced to death but was saved by Harry and Hermione, which possibly led Lucius to feel that the Hippogriff had made him and Draco look like fools.

===Death Eaters===
{{Quote|Leave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care for [[Nott]]'s injuries as much as losing that prophecy — [[Jugson]], come back here, we need to organise! We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary — [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]], you take the left, [[Crabbe]], [[Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]], go right — Jugson, [[Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]], the door straight ahead — [[Walden Macnair|Macnair]] and [[Avery II|Avery]], through here — [[Augusta Longbottom|Rookwood]], over there — [[Mulciber II|Mulciber]], come with me!|Lucius commanding his fellow Death Eaters during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Death Eaters WBST.png|220x220px|thumb|Death Eaters, his former loyal comrades]]
As a high ranking Death Eater, Lucius was occasionally given leadership over his fellows by Voldemort. When given commands, the other Death Eaters usually follow them without question or signs of resentment. Once Lucius and his family lost favour with Voldemort the other Death Eaters largely lost any respect they had towards Lucius, even loudly jeering at him when Voldemort mentioned their relation by marriage to [[werewolf]] [[Remus Lupin]] (through Lucius's niece [[Nymphadora Tonks]]).

[[Peter Pettigrew]] worked alongside Lucius in keeping prisoners in the [[Malfoy Manor]]. They also stood next to each other in the Death Eater circle following [[Return of Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's rebirth]]. Lucius and Peter's Hogwarts years would have overlapped. The relationship between the two is unknown beyond this, although Pettigrew was assigned to work in the dungeons in Malfoy Manor as a servant, meaning he possibly had a low opinion of him.

[[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] was a highly loyal Death Eater who had a strong dislike towards Lucius for never attempting to search for Voldemort after he disappeared. While [[Polyjuice Potion|disguised]] as [[Alastor Moody]] at Hogwarts, Barty enjoyed intimidating Lucius's son Draco.

[[Corban Yaxley]] seemed familiar with Lucius and his wealthy and extravagant lifestyle, though he expressed this in a snide manner.

[[Igor Karkaroff]] was a friend and comrade of Lucius's during the [[First Wizarding War]]. Lucius considered sending his son to [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]] due to Karkaroff's headmastership and the fact that Durmstrang doesn't allow [[muggle-born]] wizards and witches to attend.

Lucius appeared to be friendly with [[Crabbe]] and [[Nott]], as their sons were familiar with each other prior to arriving at Hogwarts. Nott visited the Malfoy Manor on at least one occasion to discuss unknown things with Lucius. Despite this, Lucius didn't hesitate to leave an injured Nott behind during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], knowing that Voldemort would be much angrier at losing the prophecy.

Lucius shared at least some of his Hogwarts years with [[Avery (disambiguation)|Avery]], [[Mulciber (disambiguation)|Mulciber]], [[Evan Rosier]], [[Wilkes]], and [[Rodolphus Lestrange]]. He and Rodolphus were brother-in-laws through their marriages with Naricissa and Bellatrix respectively. Lucius also chose Mulciber as his partner during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].

Lucius was disdainful towards werewolf [[Fenrir Greyback]] when he brought Harry Potter and his friends to the Malfoy Manor. Greyback was likewise resentful of the Malfoy's cold reception and argued with Lucius over who would receive credit for capturing Harry.

==Etymology==
*The name Lucius may come from the Roman dictator {{W|Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla}}, who extrajudicially executed his rivals. His name could also be a reference to the Roman Emperor Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, also known as {{W|Nero}}. Lucius is a name that derives from Latin meaning "bright" or "intelligent" and is related to the name Lucifer, the first name of Satan, which may reference Lucius Malfoy being bright but evil, or just evil.
*''Malfoy'' is derived from the French ''mal foi'' or ''mal foy'', meaning ''bad faith'' or ''unfaithful''.
*A Latin male first name. A character in Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, Lucius is the servant of Brutus, the leader of the conspirators who plot against and assassinate Caesar.

*In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], Malfoy is played by [[Jason Isaacs]]. To prepare for ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', and to get a sense of how nasty Lucius should be, Isaacs went back and watched [[Tom Felton]]'s performance in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''. [[Brett Underwood]] appears as young Lucius Malfoy in a [[Slug Club]] photograph in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''.
*In {{COS|FA}}, Lucius pushed Harry's hair back over his head to view his scar, which does not happen in the novel.
*In {{COS|FA}}, Lucius, during his encounter with Arthur Weasley, curtly says to the latter "See you at work", implying that Lucius himself may actually work in the Ministry and thus act as Arthur's coworker. However, this does not seem to be the case in the books, as Draco mentions in {{OOTP}} that "''he's always popping in and out of the Ministry''", thereby implying he does not actually work there.
**The line in the film could also imply that Lucius has visited the Ministry enough times that he and Arthur encountered each other, making the comment a sarcastic joke on Arthur's part.
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, Lucius accidentally smashes the [[prophecy]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]], rather than [[Neville Longbottom]].
*Despite not having an appearance in {{HBP|FA}} as an adult, Jason Isaacs cameos in a photograph in the [[Daily Prophet]], and [[Brett Underwood]] plays him in a Slug Club photo.
*In the novels, Lucius is not stated to have long hair. However, Jason Issacs requested long hair so that people could tell the difference between Lucius and Draco. 
*It is interesting to note that like his [[Narcissa Malfoy|wife]], Lucius Malfoy (perhaps subtly) tried to stop Voldemort from killing Harry. In {{GOF}}, Lucius prompted Voldemort to tell the Death Eaters his backstory on how he returned to power ''after ''Voldemort stated that Harry was his guest of honour, which could have been the moment where Voldemort initially intended to duel and kill Harry. This, along with the courtesy and care towards Harry in the Department of Mysteries in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|next book]] could establish that Lucius, as a father, does not like the thought of witnessing, let alone bring about, the murder of someone Draco's age, despite him being a sworn enemy.
**Lucius scolded Draco for badmouthing Harry, and reminds him that it was not prudent for him for doing so since the wizarding community regarded Harry as the hero who has vanquished Voldemort.
**In {{DH}}, when Bellatrix Lestrange attempted to summon Voldemort after the capture of Harry Potter, Lucius tried to stop her and argued that Harry has been summoned in his house, so it was him who should summon Voldemort instead.
*Also, in the films, Lucius's wand is concealed within a [[Lucius Malfoy's walking stick|snake-handelled walking stick]] that he almost always carries with him. The walking stick may have magical abilities of its own, as Lucius is seen wielding it during a duel in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] until Harry [[Disarming Charm|disarms]] him of it, to which Sirius Black comments "nice one".
*In {{COS|FA}}, after Harry caused him to inadvertently set Dobby free, Lucius Malfoy was about to cast a curse at Harry, but was stopped by [[Dobby]]. It sounded as though he was about to cast the [[Killing Curse]], because it sounded as though he said, "''Avada-"'', the entire curse was not heard because he was cut off by Dobby. The attempted use of this curse was the result of an improvisation on Isaacs's part, as the script did not specify which curse he was supposed to use, so he used the first spell that came to his mind. 
**It is worth noting that the Killing Curse's incantation (''Avada Kedavra'') had not yet been introduced in the ''Chamber of Secrets'' novel. However, the film version was released after the publication of {{GOF}} (where the incantation was first introduced), which may be the reason why Isaacs could utter the spell.
**Similarly, his dialogue to Harry where he sardonically states that they should hope that Harry Potter is still around to save the day, and Harry's response, was an improvisation by Jason Isaacs and Daniel Radcliffe, respectively, and was not in the original script. It was ad-libbed because Jason Isaacs felt it was completely out-of-character for Lucius Malfoy to simply let Dumbledore have the last word.
*In the two last films, [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Part 1]] and [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]] of [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], Lucius appears to be unshaved, having been put under pressure and stress by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], not to mention being in [[Azkaban]] for a year or so, where he would have been living in poor state. As a result, he appears thinner and has bags under his eyes.
**In addition, Lucius did have a replacement wand in the 7th film, but was dispatched by Harry before he could use it.
*Lucius Malfoy is ranked Number 12 on the ''Forbes'' Fictional 15 list of the richest people in the world.
*A variety of Elder Futhark runes are depicted on Lucius's Azkaban placard. The easily identified ones are: Othila, which means "estate, heritage, possession" and corresponds to the Latin letter "o"; Ansuz (albeit rotated slightly), meaning "one of the Æsir (gods)" and corresponds to the Latin letter "a"; Uruz, meaning "wild ox" or "water"; and Mannaz, meaning "man". It is unknown if these serve any purpose (other than for identification, like the numbers and letters), though they may be a reference to different parts of his character. For example, Othila, which could represent his abundance of material possessions & wealth, as well as his emphasis on blood purity ("heritage").
*According to Lucius's actor, Jason Isaacs, in the Maximum Movie Mode of Deathly Hallows Part 2, he believed after the battle, Lucius felt isolated from not only from everyone but his family as well. 
*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, Lucius was not able to perform a [[Killing Curse]]. Instead, he was able to release a [[peacock]] from his inventory. (It's strange because he was able to kill in {{LEGO|Y1}}.) This is because of the game's design, where the Killing Curse at [[Death Eaters]] and the inventory takes the same slot. It is likely that Lucius was "disarmed" from this ability because there were a lot of playable Death Eaters in the game who could perform a Killing Curse.
*The filmmakers had planned for Lucius to appear at the execution of [[Buckbeak]] in {{POA|FA}} and be outraged when Buckbeak escaped; however, Jason Issacs was unavailable for filming at the time.
*Recently, New Zealand biologist Tom Saunders named a new species of wasp after Lucius (''Lusius malfoyi'').
**According to Saunders, ''"People see wasps as villains, as the 'bad guys.' But the truth is that the vast majority of wasp species are either neutral or beneficial, from a human standpoint. Just as Lucius Malfoy is pardoned after separating from Voldemort's allies, I'm asking people to pardon wasps in order to restore their reputation as interesting, important creatures."''
