'''Agnes''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and patient in the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], admitted sometime before [[Christmas]] of [[1995]].


She had fur all over her head and barked instead of speaking.


[[Penny Haywood]] spoke to Agnes in the Janus Thickey Ward in the [[1990–1991 school year]] while on work experience at the hospital in her [[seventh year]].

In late [[December]] [[1995]], her [[Healer]] [[Miriam Strout]] informed that her [[Agnes's son|son]] would visit her [[Christmas]] night.


*Given the description on  presents what happens if an [[Animagus]] [[Human Transfiguration|transformation]] fails, it seems likely that this is what happened to Agnes, with her attempted Animagus form most likely being a [[dog]].


Agnes is a female given name, which derives from the Greek word hagnē, meaning "pure", "holy" or "lamb".
