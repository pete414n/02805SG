'''Professor Cuthbert''' '''Binns''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[History of Magic]] [[professor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He owned [[Cuthbert Binns's office|an office]] in [[Hogwarts Castle|the main castle]] and [[History of Magic Classroom|Classroom 4F]] on the [[Hogwarts Castle#First floor|first floor]] to teach in. He taught until a very old age, when he fell asleep in the [[staffroom|staff room]] and died in slumber. Afterwards, he became a [[ghost]] who continued to teach, droning on about various [[Goblin Rebellions]] and [[giant wars]] to bored, sleeping students.

Professor Binns's lessons were regarded as some of the most boring at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and only once in known history did he talk about something not strictly factual. During the [[1991–1992 school year]], he taught his [[First year|first-year]] students about numerous historical personalities such as [[Uric the Oddball]] and [[Emeric the Evil]], whom the class always got confused with. 

The following [[1992–1993 school year|academic year]], he relayed the legend of the [[Chamber of Secrets]] to his [[Second year|second-year]] class, but only after every student in the class showed complete and utter interest, despite initially stating the legend of the Chamber to be unimportant. 

He continued to teach [[Harry Potter]] and his class for three further years, until most, if not every one of his students dropped [[History of Magic]] after completing their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s.




Cuthbert was born into the [[Binns family]], with [[Cuthbert Binns's father|Mr Binns]] as his father. It was said that his father always used to say something to him, but Cuthbert fell asleep in the middle of his sentence before he could say what it was.


Earlier years

Cuthbert came to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and applied for the post of [[Professor]] of [[History of Magic]], which he was granted. Cuthbert - now known as Professor Binns - was given [[History of Magic Classroom|Classroom 4F]] on the first floor near a mossy courtyard to teach in, as well as [[Cuthbert Binns's office|an office]] in the fifth-floor corridor.

His lessons were known to be the most boring in all of Hogwarts; he read from his never-ending collection of notes, and his students, whom he never paid any attention to, would fall asleep listening to his droning, reedy voice, eventually waking up to copy down a name or date, but falling asleep again.

Later years and death

Professor Binns was still teaching well into his elderly years at Hogwarts, still lecturing students in History of Magic. Now so old that he looked like a wrinkled tortoise, Binns went down to the [[staffroom]] on the ground floor and went to sleep in front of the fire. However, he died in his sleep and, when he got up to teach his next class, he was a [[ghost]]. Regardless, he did not seem to notice, though he did begin to fly into his classroom through the blackboard, but his lessons were still just as boring as ever. It was said the most exciting thing that happened in his class was when he entered through the blackboard.



Late 19th century
Already deceased by the late [[19th century]], Professor Binns was teaching [[History of Magic]] in the [[1890s]].

1970s
During the [[1970s]], Professor Binns taught [[James Potter I|James Potter]], [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], [[Peter Pettigrew]], [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Sirius Black]]. For unknown reasons, Binns gave one of his [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s, that of [[Circe]], to James Potter, which later fell into the hands of [[Quirinus Quirrell]] who put it into his vault, number [[Vault 998|998]].

1986–1987 school year

During the [[1986–1987 school year]], Professor Binns was approached by [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Penny Haywood]] at his [[desk]] in the [[History of Magic Classroom]] while asleep, in order to ask him information about the famous [[Greece|Ancient Greek]] witch [[Circe]]. After being awoken by them, he was confused and thought he was teaching a class about [[Emeric the Evil]], and thought Jacob's sibling was present for an exam, and then fell asleep again. When they woke him again, Binns told Jacob's sibling in response that he given a lesson about Circe earlier that decade, and said his notes on Circe on his desk were very disorganised, to which Jacob's sibling and Penny organised for him. After agreeing to let them take his notes on Circe, he remarked her found Circe's use of the the [[human to pig spell]] the most fascinating aspect about her, before falling asleep again.

1988–1989 school year

In the [[1988–1989 school year]], one of the groups Binns taught had sixteen [[Fifth year|fifth-year]] students which included [[Jacob's sibling]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]]. As always, these classes were seen as boring by most students. Sometimes Tonks used her [[Metamorphmagus]] ability to transform into Binns in order to make lessons more interesting. Most of the time, Binns did not pay attention to the class, leading to students doing activities such as tasting confectionery or playing [[Exploding Snap]]. He even fell asleep himself sometimes in a middle of a sentence.

Sometimes during class, [[Rowan Khanna]] took over during Binns's frequent naps and inattention.  Rowan actually enjoyed the topic and aspired to be a [[professor]] after graduation. They considered the class one of their favourites, partly because these unofficial lectures allowed them to practice their teaching technique. 

During one lesson, [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] attempted to get his attention with a [[Screaming Yo-yo]] so he could place them in [[Discipline at Hogwarts|detention]], however, he failed to notice.

During this school year, Binns had the help of [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]], a fellow Hogwarts ghost, helped him teach fifth-years about [[witch-hunt]]s of the [[14th century]].

Later during this school year, [[Jacob's sibling]], [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Merula Snyde]] went to Binns in his classroom to ask him for help finding [[Peeves]]. He agreed to tell them about purely the facts about Peeves and [[poltergeist]]s, but ended up talking about [[goblin]] rebellions instead, meaning he was not much help to them.

When preparing to enter the [[Buried Vault]], Jacob's sibling went to Binns along with Bill Weasley and Merula Snyde again in order to learn about [[dragon]]s. Later, the three, along with [[Patricia Rakepick]], [[Ben Copper]] and either Charlie Weasley or [[Penny Haywood]] went to Binns to learn about [[Portkey]]s.

1989–1990 school year



During the [[1989–1990 school year]], [[Jacob's sibling]] spied on Professor Binns being spoken to by [[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]] in the [[History of Magic classroom]] under their [[invisibility cloak]]. Pince had to wake Binns up from his sleep at his desk to talk to him. They had previously agreed to do a research for ex-Professor Rakepick regarding [[Merpeople]] and [[Grindylows]] of the [[Black Lake]]. Irma suggested that they put a stop to their research due to Rakepick's departure and because the time spent on it was no longer worth it, but Binns thought that the information on merpeople must have been important because Rakepick wouldn't have distracted herself with non-important stuff, so they agreed to temporarily continue their research, and after the agreement, Cuthbert escorted her back to the library.

During this year, Binns attended the [[memorial ceremony for Rowan Khanna]] held in the [[Great Hall]], following Rowan's death. [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas]] also took over a portion of Binns's History of Magic classes, helping him teach [[Sixth year|sixth-years]] about [[Rune|ancient runes]].

1990–1991 school year

During the [[1990–1991 school year]], Professor Binns was contacted by [[Alastor Moody]] to ask him to give Jacob's sibling and Nymphadora Tonks a special lecture about [[Azkaban]], in preparation for their upcoming visit there. However as he began to inform the students about Azkaban, he fell asleep at his desk.

1991–1992 school year

During the [[1991–1992 school year]], Professor Binns gained the famous [[Harry Potter]] as a student. However, Binns did not notice his legendary pupil, since he did not pay any attention to his class as he read through his notes, expecting them to copy down bullet points. That year, Binns taught his [[First year|first-year]] students about historical figures such as [[Uric the Oddball]] and [[Emeric the Evil]], whom his students always got confused with. Harry also said that he considered [[History of Magic]] to be "easily the most boring lesson" in the school. However, Binns also gained a gifted student, [[Hermione Granger]], who alone seemed to be immune to the soporific effects of his lectures, as she listened and took notes seriously.

1992–1993 school year

]]
The following year, the Chamber of Secrets was reopened and [[Mrs Norris]], [[Argus Filch]], the [[Hogwarts caretaker|caretaker]]'s pet [[cat]], was [[petrification|petrified]] by [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]]. Regardless, the school ran as normal and one of Professor Binns's homework he gave out just after the attack was a three-foot essay on [[Medieval Assembly of European Wizards|The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards]]. While lecturing his [[Second year|second-year]] students on the [[International Warlock Convention of 1289]], Hermione Granger raised her hand and asked about the legend of the Chamber. Despite initially refusing to grant her wish, he relayed the legend after she got him to admit that legends often had some basis in fact, and seeing the unusual amount of interest and attention his class were giving him.

After reciting the story, each of his pupils argued against his belief that there was no Chamber, but he put a stop to them and their theories and, within five minutes, had bored them to sleep with his lecture. Later on in the year, he was visited by the [[Headmaster|Deputy Headmistress]], [[Minerva McGonagall]], who told him that [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] would be absent from his [[History of Magic]] class due to their visit to the petrified [[Hermione Granger]].

1993–1994 school year
 and Harry Potter to use the History of Magic classroom]]
During the [[1993–1994 school year]], Professor Binns continued to teach [[Harry Potter]] and his classmates. As preparation for the school year, Professor Binns set his [[Third year|third-year]] students an essay titled ''[[Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss]]'', over the [[1993]] summer holidays. 

One night in the winter term, Binns allowed Professor Remus Lupin, the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor|teacher]], to [[Anti-Dementor lessons|teach]] Harry how to cast the [[Patronus Charm]] in the [[History of Magic Classroom]].

1994–1995 school year

The following academic year, Professor Binns gave his [[Fourth year|fourth-year]] students a huge workload of writing an entire composition every week, in preparation for their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] examinations in their next year.

Since [[Harry Potter]] had been chosen as a champion for the [[Triwizard Tournament]], he was exempt from the End-of-Term Exams, and so, paid less attention to Binns than usual and spent the time looking up fresh [[hex]]es for the Triwizard Tasks. It was known that one [[History of Magic]] lesson was two classes before the [[Triwizard Tournament#First Task|First Task of the Triwizard Tournament]], followed by [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] with [[Minerva McGonagall]]. 

Also, the [[History of Magic]] [[fourth year exams]] were on the day of the third and final Task of the Tournament.

1995–1996 school year

, [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]]|alt]]
For one of his first classes of the [[1995–1996 school year]], known to be a Monday, Professor Binns lectured his [[Fifth year|fifth-year]] students on wars caused and participated in by [[giant]]s, which would have been interesting had it been taught by a more engaging teacher. After an hour of lecturing, Binns left [[History of Magic Classroom|the classroom]] through the blackboard. He had another [[History of Magic]] class the following Monday, just after [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s appointment as the [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor of Hogwarts]], which was noted to be just as boring, drowsy and depressing as the last. 

That year was the year of his students' [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] examinations, and he made his students write down notes for them to revise from for their exams. It was unknown if Umbridge inspected Binns's classes that year, as she was not present during Harry's lectures.

1997–1998 school year
During the [[1997–1998 school year]], Voldemort had seized control over Hogwarts. It was unknown how this affected Professor Binns or if he took any part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Death Eaters]].

After the war 
It is likely that Professor Binns continued his long tenure as [[Professor]] of [[History of Magic]] after the war. However, there was a visiting History of Magic Professor, [[Jakub Gorski]], in [[2009]], and it is unknown if Binns continued to teach alongside him or not. It's unknown what happened to Binns after this, especially because, as a ghost, his existence was endless.



Professor Binns, as being a [[ghost]], was described as looking ancient and shrivelled, and looked a little like an old tortoise when he pursed his lips. He wore glasses, which were small and thick, and had a dry, reedy voice that sounded a lot like an old vacuum cleaner, droning on and on.


Professor Binns did not display much of a personality, as all he did was read his notes in a droning voice to his students, while oblivious or disinterested about how everyone simply dozed off from boredom. However, it can be seen that he was very impatient and did not take the liberty of learning his students' names, calling [[Hermione Granger]] "Miss Grant", [[Parvati Patil]] "Miss Pennyfeather", [[Seamus Finnigan]] "O'Flaherty" and even the famous [[Harry Potter]] "Perkins". It's possible he was actually calling them by the names of previous students from years ago, possibly due to senility as he was very old at the time of [[death]]. Binns was also shown to be a firm disbeliever in legends and mythology, dedicating his studies and lectures on "''solid, believable ''fact". He was said to have a drawling monotonous voice, which most of his students become quickly bored with.


*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Being the [[Professor]] of History of Magic at Hogwarts, he was an authority in and thoroughly knowledgeable of [[magic]]al history, teaching the subject for more than a century at Hogwarts School, with his rich and varied historical knowledge spanning much of wizarding history.
*'''[[Magizoology]]''': Binns was shown to be knowledgeable in the study of magical [[creature]]s, as he had knowledge about the traits of several different breeds of [[dragon]]s.
*'''[[Wandlore]]''': Binns was knowledgeable about the history of wandlore, which he taught to sixth-years in History of Magic.
*'''[[Study of Ancient Runes]]''': Binns was knowledgeable in the field of ancient runes, as he taught [[sixth year]] History of Magic students about the history of ancient runes, during the [[1989–1990 school year]] at Hogwarts.
*'''[[Alchemy]]''': Binns was also knowledgeable about the history of Alchemy in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Europe]], which he taught to [[Seventh year|seventh-years]] in History of Magic.
*'''Teaching skills''': Binns must have proven himself to have been an adequate teacher to have acquired his position at Hogwarts as a [[Professor]] whilst he was alive. However, his teaching after his death had proven to be ineffective, as he simply read notes in a droning manner that lulled many students to fall asleep. His unenthusiastic manner of communications, lack of interest in his students' attention, and his refusal to delve into what he considered to be myth, greatly hampered his skills in delivering information to his class and keeping them interested in his subject.


*'''[[Cuthbert Binns's office|Office]]''': While teaching at Hogwarts, Binns had an office on the fifth floor.
*'''Books''': Binns owned several books, including a [[Draconifors spellbook]], [[Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century]], and [[Cuthbert Binns's books|several other books]].


*"Binns" is from "binoculars", a slang term for spectacles. Notice that Professor Binns wore very thick glasses.
*A bin is a large storage container. A dustbin is British English for a garbage can. This boring professor could be described as a ghostly storage for information that many Hogwarts students view as rubbish.



*Professor Binns does assign homework and essays, though as he is a ghost it's unknown how he is able to mark them. Given this, it is possible he has a student assistant, like the ones in [[Music classroom monitor|Music]] and [[Male Muggle Studies teacher's student assistant|Muggle Studies]]. Alternatively, he might be in possession of a quill that he can tell what to write and therefore does not need to actually touch it to grade papers.
*Binns has not appeared in any of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]] nor the PC games. His explanation in  of the legend of the [[Chamber of Secrets]] is instead given by [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|film]] and [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (PC, Mac)|PC game]].
*In the videogame ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', there is one [[History of Magic]] classroom featured on the Fourth Floor corridor. Professor Binns, however, is never seen in the game.
*The only video games Professor Binns has made an appearance (so far) are the Game Boy Color adaptations,  and , although he was mentioned in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|Order of the Phoenix]]'' video game. On the Game Boy Color versions Binns has a tendency to fall asleep during lectures and to forget about things.
*Professor Binns' first name only appeared on a list of the Hogwarts professors which was released on .
*Professor Binns is seen in the book series as a stereotyped old man; he forgets things seconds after hearing them, has a slow droning voice, and gets irritable at times.
*As Binns became a [[ghost]], he can no longer move beyond the [[veil]], and will remain earthbound for all eternity. This means that unless he resigns or is sacked, he would be the History of Magic teacher forever.
*Since Binns died in the [[staffroom]], and continued on as if nothing happened, it can be assumed that he feared [[death]] (or what lies beyond the [[veil]]). Perhaps teaching was what Binns wanted to do, for literally all eternity.
*In "Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey" ride in Orlando Florida, Dumbledore mentions that Professor Binns will be giving the audience a lecture entitled ''[[Hogwarts Through the Centuries]]'' and that it will be "...long". Harry, Ron and Hermione sneak the audience out of the [[Classroom 3C|Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom]] before Professor Binns shows up.
*In , Binns states, "''There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard!''" Ironically enough, there ''is'' a secret broom cupboard in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]: the [[Fred and George Weasley|Weasley twins]] told Harry that when they were running away from [[Argus Filch|Filch]] once, they took refuge in a broom cupboard, which was later revealed to be the [[Room of Requirement]].
*According to the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]] transcript on thepensieve.org, Professor Binns makes an appearance in the film, as a ghost who reports to Dumbledore shortly after "The Flight of the [[Fat Lady]]." However, if this is true, none of Binns' more memorable traits are portrayed in the films.
*Binns' recollection of his father strongly suggests that not only did he pick up his droning style of speech from him, but that like his own students, it put Binns himself to sleep from boredom.
*In the [[1989–1990 school year]] as seen in , Binns asked his sixth-year students (aged 16 or 17) whether they have served in the First World War, despite that one must be 18 to enlist (although many boys in real life have served by lying about their age). This would indicate that Binns had been teaching since at least 1918, and his memory had not moved on since then.


"''The most productive ghost at Hogwarts is, of course, Professor Binns, the old History of Magic teacher who fell asleep in front of the staff-room fire one day and simply got up to give his next class, leaving his body behind. There is some debate as to whether or not Professor Binns realises he is dead. While his entrance to lessons through the blackboard is vaguely amusing the first time students see it, he is not the most stimulating teacher.''

''The inspiration for Professor Binns was an old professor at my university, who gave every lecture with his eyes closed, rocking backwards and forwards slightly on his toes. While he was a brilliant man, who disgorged an immense amount of valuable information at every lecture, his disconnect with his students was total. Professor Binns is only dimly aware of his living students, and is astonished when they begin asking him questions.''"
