*In the Danish dub of the Disc 2 of , the title for ''[[Travels with Trolls]]'' was mistranslated as ''Danser med Den Hvide Dame'', which means ''Dacing with the White Lady'', and Den Hvide Dame are coincidentally also the Danish translation for "''the Wailing Widow",'' meaning it was both mistranslated as well as using the same words to describe two different things.
