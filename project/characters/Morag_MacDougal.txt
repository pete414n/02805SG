'''Morag MacDougal''' was a [[pure-blood]]<ref name="HPM"/> [[Wizardkind|witch]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]] and was sorted into the [[Ravenclaw]]<ref name="HPM"/> house. She was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="PS7">{{PS|B|7}}</ref>

==Biography==
She was the witch who [[Neville Longbottom]] had to give the [[Sorting Hat]] back to when he accidentally ran off with it after being sorted.<ref name="PS7"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on a list of students revealed by [[J. K. Rowling]] in {{HPM}}, this character was originally named "Katrina" and later changed to "Isobel".<ref>{{WW|the-original-forty}} on {{PM}}</ref>
*A student named [[Morag]] appeared in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (PC, Mac)|PC version]] of [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' (video game)]]. She worked with matches in [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s [[Transfiguration (class)|transfiguration class]]. It is possible that this is Morag MacDougal, who may have repeated her first year. ([[Match to needle spell|Match to needle]] is a spell known to be covered in first year transfiguration classes.)

==Etymology==
Morag is from Gaelic mór, "tall." Dougall is from the Gaelic Dubhgall, or "dark stranger," and "Mac" is "son of."
