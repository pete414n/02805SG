{{Dialogue a-b|Mr Granger|Is this in [[Australia]]?|Mrs Granger|Looks wonderful, doesn't it?|Mr Granger and his [[Hermione Granger's mother|wife]] looking at houses|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1}}
'''Mr Granger''' (temporarily known as '''Wendell Wilkins''') was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]], the husband of [[Hermione Granger's mother|Mrs Granger]], and father of [[Hermione Granger|Hermione Jean Granger]]. Working as a [[dentist]] alongside his wife, he and his family lived in a [[Grangers' house|house]] located on the outskirts of [[London]].

He and his wife were proud and accepting of their daughter's identity as a [[Wizardkind|witch]], which explained some strange things which happened around her when she was a child. They entered the magical world in [[1992]] to buy Hermione's school supplies, and were assisted by [[Arthur Weasley]]. Several years later, however, Hermione was forced to alter her parents' memories and give them new identities as Wendell and Monica Wilkins, to protect them from the [[Death Eaters]].

After the [[Second Wizarding War]] ended, Hermione found Mr Granger and his wife in [[Australia]] and returned their memories.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|Well, both my parents are dentists.|Professor Slughorn|Fascinating, and is that considered a dangerous profession?|Hermione talking to [[Horace Slughorn]] about her parents|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)}}[[File:Grangers.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Mr Granger with his wife in the early 1980s]]
Mr Granger was born to [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] parents, at least one of whom may have been descended from a [[Squib]].

Mr Granger was a well-qualified individual who held a career in [[dentist]]ry. This was presumably how he met [[Hermione Granger's mother|his wife]], who was in the same profession.

He and his wife both achieved a Licentiate in Dental Surgery, earning the prefix of "doctor" and married, living in a [[Grangers' house|house]] on a street somewhere in England.

===Fatherhood===
{{Quote|The Forest of Dean. I came camping here once, with my mum and dad.|Hermione mentioning her parents during the Horcrux hunt|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-mr_granger.jpg|251x251px|thumb|Mr Granger standing next to his daughter]]

On [[19 September]], [[1979]] they had a daughter, [[Hermione Granger|Hermione Jean Granger]]. The couple chose a "nice, unusual" first name that others had difficulty pronouncing because they "''liked to prove how clever they were''."

The couple gave Hermione a [[Hermione Granger's bedroom|bedroom]] on the first floor of their house, and they lived happily for many years.

At some point, Mr and Mrs Granger took Hermione camping in the [[Forest of Dean]]. They also went to a theatre on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] in [[London]], and at least once went to [[Tottenham Court Road]] with her.

Hermione attended a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] school and was rather bright for her age. Hermione tells Horace Slughorn that one time whilst at work, her father was bitten by a [[Robbie Fenwick|boy]] and had to be taken to hospital to receive several stitches.

===Discovering the wizarding world===
{{Quote|I've tried a few simple spells myself and they've all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, it's the best school of witchcraft there is I've heard-- I've learned all the course books by heart, of course.|Hermione regarding her Hogwarts acceptance letter|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
At some point prior to [[1 September]] [[1991]], Mr Granger and his wife were visited by a staff member from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], who gave them the letter inviting their daughter to the school. This visit revealed their daughter, Hermione, to be a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], something that apparently came as quite a surprise. Hermione, at least, was shocked, but very pleased, and her parents were supportive of her.

====1991-1992====
[[File:Harry-potter2-diagon_ally.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione and her parents in Diagon Alley]]

In [[1991]], Mr Granger and his wife accompanied their daughter to [[Diagon Alley]] to purchase her school supplies, including her wand from [[Ollivanders]].

Mrs and Mr Granger were separated from their daughter after she took the [[Hogwarts Express]] to her new school. They were bemused by Hermione's new identity, but were proud of her, as she had memorised all of her school books before leaving.

Mr and Mrs Granger corresponded with Hermione by owl post while she was at school and took her for a holiday to France in the summer of 1993.

====1992-1993====
{{Quote|Arthur Weasley was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them.|Description|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}For the [[1992–1993 school year]], Mr and Mrs Granger had to purchase more school equipment for their daughter. Firstly, in order to buy the supplies, they went to [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] to exchange [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Muggle money|money]] for [[wizarding currency]].

There, they met her friends Harry Potter and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], as well as Ron's family. Ron's father, [[Arthur Weasley]], was obsessed with Muggles. Arthur was fascinated by the ten-pound notes that Mr Granger had in his hand, asked them all about their money, and took them out for a drink.

[[File:Harry-potter2-mr_&_mrs_granger.jpg|250px|thumb|Mr and Mrs Granger talking with Arthur Weasley in [[Flourish and Blotts]]
]]

The Grangers went with the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]] to Flourish and Blotts to purchase spellbooks with their new money. [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] was there doing book signings, which Mr and Mrs Granger queued up for with the Weasleys. When [[Lucius Malfoy]] approached Arthur and began arguing, Mr Granger and his wife watched apprehensively. Being a pure-blood supremacist, Malfoy scorned Arthur for being in the Grangers' company, glancing at them. The two wizards proceeded to argue with each other, before [[Rubeus Hagrid]] stopped them.

The Grangers left with the Weasleys, shocked and frightened by what they had just witnessed. They went to the [[Leaky Cauldron]] Inn, sitting by the fireplace, before saying farewell to the Weasleys and [[Harry Potter]] and leaving with their daughter for the Muggle world. After the school term ended, Mr and Mrs Granger took Hermione on holiday to [[France]] during the summer holidays. There, Hermione ate [[bouillabaisse]], which she liked the taste of.

====1995-1996====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|What are you doing here? I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad.|Hermione Granger|Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing. So I've come for Christmas... Anyway, Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told them that everyone who's serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they'll understand.|[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] speaking with Harry about her holiday|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}During the [[1995–1996 school year]], Mr and Mrs Granger arranged a skiing trip over the [[Christmas holidays]]. However, Hermione told them at the last minute that she wanted to stay at Hogwarts in order to study hard for her fifth year exams, the Ordinary Wizarding Levels, which are roughly equivalent to [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] O-Levels. Mr Granger and his wife were both disappointed, but, because they wanted their daughter to achieve good grades, they understood. Hermione instead ended up going to [[12 Grimmauld Place]] to cheer up Harry, who had been refusing to speak to any of the house's occupants and spent Christmas with the [[Weasley family]].

====1997-1998====
[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-memory_charm.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Hermione modifying her parents' memories]]

In [[1997]], Hermione modified her father's memory so that he believed he was Wendell Wilkins, who didn't have a daughter and who wanted to live in [[Australia]], and did the same to her mother so that she believed she was Monica Wilkins. This was to protect her parents from [[Death Eaters]] during the worst of the [[Second Wizarding War]], as their daughter was very close friends with [[Harry Potter]] and she was a [[Muggle-born]].

===Later life===
Sometime after the war ended in 1998, Hermione found him and restored his memories back to their original state. Later in his life he would become a grandfather to [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo Weasley]] and the father-in-law of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].

==Relationships==
===Family===

====Granger family====
{{Quote|They are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but quite proud of her all the same.|A description of the Grangers' relationship with Hermione|J. K. Rowling}}[[File:Hermione Granger HBP.jpg|thumb|250x250px|[[Hermione Granger]], his daughter and only child]]Mr Granger's relationship with his wife is largely unknown, though they were presumably happy together. They both worked as [[dentist]]s together, and frequently went on holidays, such as the one to [[France]]. The two of them appeared to have a shared taste in real estate, as they both commented on a house in [[Australia]] that was being shown on [[television]].

His relationship with Hermione was presumably a good one. Hermione was deeply upset about the [[False memory spell]] that she put on her parents. Mr Granger was also disappointed when she did not come with him and his wife to [[France]], but he wanted her to do well in her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s and accepted that.

====Weasley family====
{{Quote|But you're ''Muggles''! We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money? Molly, look!|[[Arthur Weasley]] looking at Mr Granger's money|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|250x250px|thumb|left|The Weasley family]]

Mr and Mrs Granger first met the [[Weasley family]] in [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], where they stood nervously waiting for their daughter to introduce them.

The couple came to trust the Weasleys very much, allowing their daughter to stay at their house over the holidays, prior to the school term, and to go to the [[Quidditch World Cup]] in [[1994]].

The two families were brought even closer when Hermione married [[Ronald Weasley]] and had [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]].

==Behind the scenes==
*Mr Granger was portrayed by [[Tom Knight]] in {{COS|FA}}, but he was replaced by [[Ian Kelly]] for {{DH|F1}}.
*In the earliest draft of {{PS}} the Potters lived on an island, and the Grangers lived on the shore nearby. When Voldemort killed James and Lily, Mr Granger noticed an explosion. He got on his boat and rowed out to the island to see what had happened, and found Harry.
*In {{DH|F1}}, Hermione vanishes from all the photographs kept in the Granger house after she cast the [[Memory Charm]] on Mr and Mrs Granger. She was upset by what she had done to her parents, and cried several times afterwards. The Death Eater [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]] can be seen in a deleted scene entering the empty home in search of Hermione.
*It is possible his "Wendell Wilkins" alias may be a reference to {{wplink|Wendell Wilkie}}, an American politician who ran unsuccessfully for president against Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1940.
