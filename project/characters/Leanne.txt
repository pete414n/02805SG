{{Quote|Well, that's why we were arguing. [[Katie Bell|She]] came back from the bathroom in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] holding [[Opal Necklace|it]], said it was a surprise for [[Albus Dumbledore|somebody]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when she said it.... Oh no, oh no, I bet she'd been [[Imperius Curse|Imperiused]] and I didn't realise! |Leanne realising [[Katie Bell]] was cursed|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
'''Leanne''' (c. [[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She was a friend of [[Katie Bell]] during her time at Hogwarts. She was sorted into [[Hufflepuff]]<ref name="HBPF"/> and attended Hogwarts around the same time as the famous [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="HBP12" /> 

Leanne was a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] and later fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. She witnessed Harry's final defeat of [[Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and survived the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Her later life is currently unknown.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Leanne was born in or around [[1980]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]].

===Hogwarts years {{C|1991-1998}}===
====Early years====
[[File:Harry Potter and first years to be sorted.png|250px|thumb|left|Leanne's Sorting where she was Sorted into Hufflepuff]]
Leanne started her [[magic]]al education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. Her [[Head of House]] was the [[Herbology]] [[Professor]], [[Pomona Sprout]].<ref name="HBPF"/> Despite being in separate Houses, she became good friends with [[Gryffindor]] student [[Katie Bell]].<ref name="HBP12"/> It is unknown if Leanne joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] in [[1995]], as Katie did, but she joined the group in late [[1997]], when [[Neville Longbottom]] assumed the group.<ref name="DHF2"/>

====Sixth year====
{{Quote|No…she wouldn’t tell me…and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn’t listen and…and then I tried to grab it from her…and — and —|A distressed Leanne telling the [[trio]] what happened|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}In her [[1996-1997 school year|sixth year]], she and Katie went on a [[Hogsmeade weekend trips|weekend trip]] to [[Hogsmeade]], and they stopped off for a drink in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]]. Katie excused herself and went to the lavatory whilst Leanne sat alone in the pub. After some time, she was spotted by Harry Potter sitting tapping her glass anxiously awaiting Katie's return. [[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-leanne_katie_hogsmede.jpg|250px|thumb|Katie and Leanne walking in the snow on their way back to the castle grounds]]

Finally, when she and Katie were returning to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] after their visit to [[Hogsmeade]], she and Katie got in an argument over a package that Katie had been given in the pub to take to the castle. Leanne did not want Katie to take it, as its origins were unknown and thereby suspicious. The argument caused the girls to fight over the package and Katie to accidentally touch the cursed [[Opal Necklace]] that was given to her by [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]], who was under the [[Imperius Curse]] at the time, when the package's wrapping tore.<ref name="HBP12">{{HBP|B|12}}</ref>

[[File:B6C12M1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Leanne tries to tug her friend back to the ground after she is cursed]]

Leanne was very distraught when Katie was put under the [[curse]], trying to pull her down from the sky in which she floated above from and was seen crying. Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] got to the scene and, with the help of [[Rubeus Hagrid]], they got back to Hogwarts with Katie. When they got back inside the castle, Leanne broke down crying when telling [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] what happened and was sent to [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] to get something for the shock.<ref name="HBP12"/> After Katie was healed and returned to Hogwarts, Leanne was present with her when Katie told Harry she did not know who gave her the package.<ref name="HBP24">{{HBP|B|24}}</ref>

====Seventh year ====
{{Quote|Well, it’s not really like Hogwarts any more,|Neville Longbottom speaking of the school under the reign of Snape|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

In Leanne's [[1997–1998 school year|seventh and final year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], her education would take a turn for the worst. With the former headmaster Albus Dumbledore dead, [[Severus Snape]] took to the position of head and employed [[Death Eaters]], [[Amycus Carrow]] and [[Alecto Carrow]] as new members of his staff. 

Any resistance against the war and defiance against their teaching methods had the student brutally punished, as demonstrated numerous times with pupil [[Neville Longbottom|Longbottom]], the leader of the reformed [[Dumbledore's Army]], which she eventually joined in that year.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

On the [[Hogwarts Express]] journey to the school that year, she sat amongst [[Romilda Vane]], [[Lavender Brown]] and [[Cormac McLaggen]], as was present when the [[Death Eaters]] [[Raid on the Hogwarts Express|raided and searched]] the train for Harry Potter.<ref name="DHF1">{{DH|F1}}</ref>

===== Battle of Hogwarts =====
[[File:Padma_Leanne_Katie_Cho.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Leanne with Katie, [[Cho Chang|Cho]], and [[Padma Patil|Padma]] in the Great Hall after the final battle]]

Late into the academic year, the climax of the [[Second Wizarding War]] broke out and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] took place. Leanne courageously joined her fellow students and DA comrades in fighting against the [[Death Eaters]] and [[Dark Arts|Dark Forces]] which threatened their school. During the first part of the battle she was also seen fighting along side: Aberforth Dumbledore, Ginny Weasley, Padma Patil, Romilda Vane, Seamus Finnigan, and Katie Bell. 

She survived the battle and was later seen sitting in the Great Hall with Katie, Padma, and [[Cho Chang]].<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref> However, what Leanne did after surviving the [[Second Wizarding War]], is currently unknown.

==Personality and traits==
Leanne was evidently an intelligent and observant girl, as she warned Katie against touching Draco's necklace and later correctly deduced that she was acting under the influence of the [[Imperius Curse]]. She was also very concerned for her friends' well-being and safety, showing her loyalty and kindness as a [[Hufflepuff]].<ref name="HBP12"/> 

In addition, Leanne was also highly courageous, as she bravely participated and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts against the Death Eaters, and even survived.<ref name="DHF2" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Leanne was shown to have been a skilled duellist, as she courageously fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]] as a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], fighting against many highly dangerous [[Death Eaters]], and even survived the battle.<ref name="DHF2"/>

==Relationships==

===Katie Bell===
[[File:Katie_Bell_infobox.jpg|thumb|[[Katie Bell]], her good friend]]
Leanne was good friends with Katie Bell, chatting her to on the Hogwarts Express and attending [[Hogsmeade]] together. When Katie was bewitched with the [[Imperius Curse]] and came into possession of the [[curse]]d [[Opal Necklace]], she tried to stop her friend from carrying the necklace to Hogwarts, with great effort. Leanne had a horrible reaction after Katie was harmed and nearly killed by the cursed necklace, showing her concern and worry over her friend's life, showing her to have been a very loyal and genuine friend to Katie.<ref name="HBP12"/>

===Romilda Vane===
Leanne seemed to get along well with [[Romilda Vane]], a bold and vivacious student two years younger than she was. They fought bravely together in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Death Eaters]] to protect their school. Romilda sat with Leanne on the [[Hogwarts Express]] on the way to school,<ref name="DHF1"/> and much later they kept each other company and rested either during or after the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name="DHF2"/> Romilda also likely got along with Katie, given her personality, most likely as a result.

==Behind the scenes==
*Leanne is portrayed by [[Isabella Laughland]] in {{HBP|FA}}.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7150000/newsid_7152200/7152288.stm CBBC Newsround reveals new Half-Blood Prince casting]</ref> Based on screenshots from the film, she is a [[Hufflepuff]] who is potentially in the same year as Harry, although neither her house nor age is revealed in the book. She reprised her role in both parts of the film adaptation of {{DH}}.<ref>{{IMDb|nm2877285|Isabella Laughland}}</ref>
*In the book, it appears that Leanne was a [[Gryffindor]] in [[Katie Bell]]'s year since Katie said ''"Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match"'' right after Harry saw her speaking with her fellow seventh years in the [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor common room]].<ref name="HBP24" />
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{HBP}}, Leanne has blonde hair during play mode, but during a cut scene mode she has brown, like in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film]].
*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, Katie Bell's cursing is omitted and due to this, Leanne is absent from all the console versions of the game. However, Leanne is playable in the portable versions, including the ones for Nintendo DS and 3DS.
