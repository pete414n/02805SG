— chapter four — at flourish and blotts life at the burrow was as different as possible from life in privet drive. Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley liked everything neat and ordered; the weasleys’ house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry_Potter got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, ‘tuck your shirt in, scruffy!’ the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley’s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. what Harry_Potter found most unusual about life at ron’s, however, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him. Molly_Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Arthur_Weasley liked Harry_Potter to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked. ‘fascinating!’ he would say, as Harry_Potter talked him through using a telephone. ‘ingenious, really, how many ways muggles have found of getting along without magic.’ Harry_Potter heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the burrow. he and Ronald_Weasley went down to breakfast to find mr and Molly_Weasley and Ginevra_Weasley already sitting at the kitchen table. the moment she saw Harry_Potter, Ginevra_Weasley accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginevra_Weasley seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry_Potter entered a room. she dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. pretending he hadn’t noticed this, Harry_Potter sat down and took the toast Molly_Weasley offered him. ‘letters from school,’ said Arthur_Weasley, passing Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. ‘Albus_Dumbledore already knows you’re here, Harry_Potter – doesn’t miss a trick, that man. you two’ve got them, too,’ he added, as Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley ambled in, still in their pyjamas. for a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. Harry_Potter’s told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from king’s cross station on   september the first. there was also a list of the new books he’d need for the coming year. second-year students will require: the standard book of spells, grade 2 by miranda goshawk break with a banshee by Gilderoy_Lockhart gadding with ghouls by Gilderoy_Lockhart holidays with hags by Gilderoy_Lockhart travels with trolls by Gilderoy_Lockhart voyages with vampires by Gilderoy_Lockhart wanderings with werewolves by Gilderoy_Lockhart year with the yeti by Gilderoy_Lockhart Fred_Weasley, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry_Potter’s. ‘you’ve been told to get all lockhart’s books, too!’ he said. ‘the new defence against the dark arts teacher must be a fan – bet it’s a witch.’ at this point, Fred_Weasley caught his mother’s eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade. ‘that lot won’t come cheap,’ said George_Weasley, with a quick look at his parents. ‘lockhart’s books are really expensive …’ ‘well, we’ll manage,’ said Molly_Weasley, but she looked worried. ‘i expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginevra_Weasley’s things second-hand.’ ‘oh, are you starting at hogwarts this year?’ Harry_Potter asked Ginevra_Weasley. she nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish. fortunately no one saw this except Harry_Potter, because just then ron’s elder brother Percy_Weasley walked in. he was already dressed, his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his knitted tank top. ‘morning, all,’ said Percy_Weasley briskly. ‘lovely day.’ he sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath him a moulting, grey feather duster – at least, that was what Harry_Potter thought it was, until he saw that it was breathing. ‘Errol!’ said Ronald_Weasley taking the limp owl from Percy_Weasley and extracting a letter from under its wing. ‘finally – he’s got Hermione_Granger’s answer. i wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley.’ he carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him    on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ronald_Weasley laid him on the draining board instead, muttering, ‘pathetic.’ then he ripped open Hermione_Granger’s letter and read it out loud: dear Ronald_Weasley and Harry_Potter if you’re there, i Hope_Howell everything went all right and that Harry_Potter is ok and that you didn’t do anything illegal to get him out, Ronald_Weasley because that would get Harry_Potter into trouble, too. i’ve been really worried and if Harry_Potter is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl, because i think another delivery might finish your one off. i’m very busy with school work, of course – ‘how can she be?’ said Ronald_Weasley in horror. ‘we’re on holiday!’ – and we’re going to london next wednesday to buy my new books. why don’t we meet in diagon alley? let me know what’s happening as soon as you can, love from Hermione_Granger. ‘well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,’ said Molly_Weasley, starting to clear the table. ‘what’re you all up to today?’ Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the weasleys owned. it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practise quidditch there, as long as they didn’t fly too high. they couldn’t use real quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for each other to catch. they took it in turns to ride Harry_Potter’s nimbus two thousand, which was easily the best broom; ron’s old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies. five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over their shoulders. they had asked Percy_Weasley if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy. Harry_Potter had only seen Percy_Weasley at meal-times so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time. ‘wish i knew what he was up to,’ said Fred_Weasley, frowning. ‘he’s not himself. his exam results came the day before you did; twelve o.w.ls and he hardly gloated at all.’ ‘ordinary wizarding levels,’ George_Weasley explained, seeing Harry_Potter’s puzzled look. ‘bill got twelve, too. if we’re not careful, we’ll have another head boy in the family. i don’t think i could stand the shame.’   bill was the oldest weasley brother. he and the next brother, Charles_Weasley, had already left hogwarts. Harry_Potter had never met either of them, but knew that Charles_Weasley was in romania, studying dragons, and William_Weasley in egypt, working for the wizards’ bank, Gringotts_Head_Goblin. ‘dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,’ said George_Weasley after a while. ‘five sets of lockhart books! and Ginevra_Weasley needs robes and a wand and everything …’ Harry_Potter said nothing. he felt a bit awkward. stored in an underground vault at Gringotts_Head_Goblin in london was a small fortune that his parents had left him. of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you couldn’t use galleons, sickles and knuts in muggle shops. he had never mentioned his Gringotts_Head_Goblin bank account to Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley; he didn’t think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold. * Molly_Weasley woke them all early the following wednesday. after a quick half-a-dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Molly_Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside. ‘we’re running low, Arthur_Weasley,’ she sighed. ‘we’ll have to buy some more today … ah well, guests first! after you, Harry_Potter dear!’ and she offered him the flowerpot. Harry_Potter stared at them all watching him. ‘w-what am i supposed to do?’ he stammered. ‘he’s never travelled by floo powder,’ said Ronald_Weasley suddenly. ‘sorry, Harry_Potter, i forgot.’ ‘never?’ said Arthur_Weasley. ‘but how did you get to diagon alley to buy your school things last year?’ ‘i went on the underground –’ ‘really?’ said Arthur_Weasley eagerly. ‘were there escapators? how exactly –’ ‘not now, Arthur_Weasley,’ said Molly_Weasley. ‘floo powder’s a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you’ve never used it before –’ ‘he’ll be all right, mum,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘Harry_Potter, watch us first.’ he took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire and threw the powder into the flames. with a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred_Weasley, who stepped right into it, shouted, ‘diagon alley!’ and vanished. ‘you must speak clearly, dear,’ Molly_Weasley told Harry_Potter, as George_Weasley dipped his hand into the flowerpot. ‘and mind you get out at the right grate …’ ‘the right what?’ said Harry_Potter nervously, as the fire roared and whipped George_Weasley out of sight too. ‘well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you’ve spoken clearly –’ ‘he’ll be fine, Molly_Weasley, don’t fuss,’ said Arthur_Weasley, helping himself to floo powder too. ‘but dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle?’ ‘they wouldn’t mind,’ Harry_Potter reassured her. ‘Dudley_Dursley would think it was a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney, don’t worry about that.’ ‘well … all right … you go after Arthur_Weasley,’ said Molly_Weasley. ‘now, when you get into the fire, say where you’re going –’ ‘and keep your elbows tucked in,’ Ronald_Weasley advised. ‘and your eyes shut,’ said Molly_Weasley. ‘the soot –’ ‘don’t fidget,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace –’ ‘but don’t panic and get out too early, wait until you see Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley.’ trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry_Potter took a pinch of floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire. he took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash. ‘d-dia-gon alley,’ he coughed. it felt as though he was being sucked down a giant plug hole. he seemed to be spinning very fast … the roaring in his ears was deafening … he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick … something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning … now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face … squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond … his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him … he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then – he fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt his glasses shatter. dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. he was quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. all he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard’s shop – but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a hogwarts school list. a glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a blood-stained pack of cards and a staring glass eye. evil-looking masks leered down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry_Potter could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not diagon alley. the sooner he got out of here, the better. nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry_Potter made his way swiftly and silently towards the door, but before he’d got halfway towards it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass – and one of them was the very last person Harry_Potter wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot and wearing broken glasses: Draco_Malfoy. Harry_Potter looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors to, leaving a small crack to peer through. seconds later, a bell clanged, and malfoy stepped into the shop. the man who followed could only be his father. he had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold grey eyes. mr malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, ‘touch nothing, Draco_Malfoy.’ malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, ‘i thought you were going to buy me a present.’ ‘i said i would buy you a racing broom,’ said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter. ‘what’s the good of that if i’m not in the house team?’ said malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. ‘Harry_Potter got a nimbus two thousand last year. special permission from Albus_Dumbledore so he could play for gryffindor. he’s not even that good, it’s just because he’s famous … famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead …’ malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls. ‘… everyone thinks he’s so smart, wonderful potter with his scar and his broomstick –’ ‘you have told me this at least a dozen times already,’ said mr malfoy, with a quelling look at his son, ‘and i would remind you that it is not – prudent – to appear less than fond of Harry_Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lord disappear – ah, mr Borgin.’ a stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face. ‘mr malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,’ said mr Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. ‘delighted – and young master malfoy, too – charmed. how may i be of assistance? i must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced –’ ‘i’m not buying today, mr Borgin, but selling,’ said mr malfoy. ‘selling?’ the smile faded slightly from mr Borgin’s face. ‘you have heard, of course, that the ministry is conducting more raids,’ said mr malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unravelling it for mr Borgin to read. ‘i have a few – ah – items at home that might embarrass me, if the ministry were to call …’ mr Borgin fixed a Irma_Pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list. ‘the ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?’ mr malfoy’s lip curled. ‘i have not been visited yet. the name malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome. there are rumours about a new muggle protection act – no doubt that flea-bitten, muggle- loving fool Arthur_Weasley is behind it –’ Harry_Potter felt a hot surge of anger. ‘– and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear –’ ‘i understand, sir, of course,’ said mr Borgin. ‘let me see …’ ‘can i have that?’ interrupted Draco_Malfoy, pointing at the withered hand on its cushion. ‘ah, the hand of glory!’ said mr Borgin, abandoning mr malfoy’s list and scurrying over to Draco_Malfoy. ‘insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! best friend of thieves and plunderers! your son has fine taste, sir.’ ‘i Hope_Howell my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,’ said mr malfoy coldly and mr Borgin said quickly, ‘no offence, sir, no offence meant –’ ‘though if his school marks don’t pick up,’ said mr malfoy, more coldly still, ‘that may indeed be all he is fit for.’ ‘it’s not my fault,’ retorted Draco_Malfoy. ‘the teachers all have favourites, that Hermione_Granger –’ ‘i would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,’ snapped mr malfoy. ‘ha!’ said Harry_Potter under his breath, pleased to see Draco_Malfoy looking both abashed and angry. ‘it’s the same all over,’ said mr Borgin, in his oily voice. ‘wizard blood is counting for less everywhere –’ ‘not with me,’ said mr malfoy, his long nostrils flaring. ‘no, sir, nor with me, sir,’ said mr Borgin, with a deep bow. ‘in that case, perhaps we can return to my list,’ said mr malfoy shortly. ‘i am in something of a hurry, Borgin, i have important business elsewhere today.’ they started to haggle. Harry_Potter watched nervously as Draco_Malfoy drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. he paused to examine a long coil of hangman’s rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals: caution: do not touch. cursed – has claimed the lives of nineteen muggle owners to date. Draco_Malfoy turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. he walked forward … he stretched out his hand for the handle … ‘done,’ said mr malfoy at the counter. ‘come, Draco_Malfoy!’ Harry_Potter wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco_Malfoy turned away. ‘good day to you, mr Borgin, i’ll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.’ the moment the door had closed, mr Borgin dropped his oily manner. ‘good day yourself, mister malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven’t sold me half of what’s hidden in your manor …’ muttering darkly, mr Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry_Potter waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases and out of the shop door. clutching his broken glasses to his face he stared around. he had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the dark arts. the one he’d just left, Borgin and burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads, and two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. two shabby- looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. feeling jumpy, Harry_Potter set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against Hope_Howell he’d be able to find a way out of there. an old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in knockturn alley. this didn’t help, as Harry_Potter had never heard of such a place. he supposed he hadn’t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the weasleys’ fire. trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do. ‘not lost are you, my dear?’ said a voice in his ear, making him jump. an aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. she leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry_Potter backed away. ‘i’m fine, thanks,’ he said. ‘i’m just –’ ‘Harry_Potter! what d’yeh think yer doin’ down there?’ Harry_Potter’s heart leapt. so did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Rubeus_Hagrid, the hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding towards them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard. ‘Rubeus_Hagrid!’ Harry_Potter croaked in relief. ‘i was lost … floo powder …’ Rubeus_Hagrid seized Harry_Potter by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight. Harry_Potter saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance: Gringotts_Head_Goblin bank. Rubeus_Hagrid had steered him right into diagon alley. ‘yer a mess!’ said Rubeus_Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry_Potter so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon Mundungus_Fletcher outside an apothecary’s. ‘skulkin’ around knockturn alley, i dunno – dodgy place, Harry_Potter – don’ want no one ter see yeh down there –’ ‘i realised that,’ said Harry_Potter, ducking as Rubeus_Hagrid made to brush him off again. ‘i told you, i was lost – what were you doing down there, anyway?’ ‘i was lookin’ fer a flesh-eatin’ slug repellent,’ growled Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘they’re ruinin’ the school cabbages. yer not on yer own?’ ‘i’m staying with the weasleys but we got separated,’ Harry_Potter explained. ‘i’ve got to go and find them …’ they set off together down the street. ‘how come yeh never wrote back ter me?’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, as Harry_Potter jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of Rubeus_Hagrid’s enormous boots). Harry_Potter explained all about Dobby and Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley. ‘ruddy muggles,’ growled Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘if i’d’ve known –’ ‘Harry_Potter! Harry_Potter! over here!’ Harry_Potter looked up and saw Hermione_Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts_Head_Goblin. she ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her. ‘what happened to your glasses? hello, Rubeus_Hagrid … oh, it’s wonderful to see you two again … are you coming into Gringotts_Head_Goblin, Harry_Potter?’ ‘as soon as i’ve found the weasleys,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘yeh won’t have long ter wait,’ grinned Rubeus_Hagrid. Harry_Potter and Hermione_Granger looked around; sprinting up the crowded street were Ronald_Weasley Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley, Percy_Weasley and Arthur_Weasley. ‘Harry_Potter,’ Arthur_Weasley panted. ‘we Hope_Howelld you’d only gone one grate too far …’ he mopped his glistening bald patch. ‘Molly_Weasley’s frantic – she’s coming now.’ ‘where did you come out?’ Ronald_Weasley asked. ‘knockturn alley,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid grimly. ‘brilliant!’ said Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley together. ‘we’ve never been allowed in,’ said Ronald_Weasley enviously. ‘i should ruddy well think not,’ growled Rubeus_Hagrid. Molly_Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginevra_Weasley just clinging onto the other. ‘oh, Harry_Potter – oh, my dear – you could have been anywhere –’ gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Rubeus_Hagrid hadn’t managed to beat away. Arthur_Weasley took Harry_Potter’s glasses, gave them a tap of his wand and returned them, good as new. ‘well, gotta be off,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by Molly_Weasley (‘knockturn alley! if you hadn’t found him, Rubeus_Hagrid!’). ‘see yer at hogwarts!’ and he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street. ‘guess who i saw in Borgin and burkes?’ Harry_Potter asked Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger as they climbed the Gringotts_Head_Goblin steps. ‘malfoy and his father.’ ‘did Lucius_Malfoy buy anything?’ said Arthur_Weasley sharply behind them. ‘no, he was selling.’ ‘so he’s worried,’ said Arthur_Weasley with grim satisfaction. ‘oh, i’d love to get Lucius_Malfoy for something …’ ‘you be careful, Arthur_Weasley,’ said Molly_Weasley sharply, as they were ushered into the bank by a bowing goblin at the door. ‘that family’s trouble, don’t go biting off more than you can chew.’ ‘so you don’t think i’m a match for Lucius_Malfoy?’ said Arthur_Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione_Granger’s parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione_Granger to introduce them. ‘but you’re muggles!’ said Arthur_Weasley delightedly. ‘we must have a drink! what’s that you’ve got there? oh, you’re changing muggle money. Molly_Weasley, look!’ he pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Hermione_Granger's_father’s hand. ‘meet you back here,’ Ronald_Weasley said to Hermione_Granger, as the weasleys and Harry_Potter were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts_Head_Goblin goblin. the vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train-tracks through the bank’s underground tunnels. Harry_Potter enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the weasleys’ vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in knockturn alley, when it was opened. there was a very small pile of silver sickles inside, and just one gold galleon. Molly_Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry_Potter felt even worse when they reached his vault. he tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag. back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy_Weasley muttered vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley had spotted their friend from hogwarts, Lee_Jordan. Molly_Weasley and Ginevra_Weasley were going to a second- hand robe shop. Arthur_Weasley was insisting on taking Hermione_Granger's_father and Hermione_Granger's_mother off to the leaky cauldron for a drink. ‘we’ll all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your school books,’ said Molly_Weasley, setting off with Ginevra_Weasley. ‘and not one step down knockturn alley!’ she shouted at the twins’ retreating backs. Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger strolled off along the winding, cobbled street. the bag of gold, silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry_Potter’s pocket was clamouring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry and peanut-butter ice-creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ronald_Weasley gazed longingly at a full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of ‘quality quidditch supplies’ until Hermione_Granger dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. in gambol and japes wizarding joke shop, they met Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley and Lee_Jordan, who were stocking up on ‘dr filibuster’s fabulous wet-start, no-heat fireworks’, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, wonky brass scales and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy_Weasley, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called prefects who gained power. ‘a study of hogwarts prefects and their later careers,’ Ronald_Weasley read aloud off the back cover. ‘that sounds fascinating …’ ‘go away,’ Percy_Weasley snapped. ‘course, he’s very ambitious, Percy_Weasley, he’s got it all planned out … he wants to be minister of magic …’ Ronald_Weasley told Harry_Potter and Hermione_Granger in an undertone, as they left Percy_Weasley to it. an hour later, they headed for flourish and blotts. they were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. as they approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying to get in. the reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows:  Gilderoy_Lockhart will be signing copies of his autobiography magical me today 12.30 – 4.30 pm ‘we can actually meet him!’ Hermione_Granger squealed. ‘i mean, he’s written almost the whole booklist!’ the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Molly_Weasley’s age. a harassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, ‘calmly, please ladies … don’t push, there … mind the books, now …’ Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger squeezed inside. a long queue wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy_Lockhart was signing his books. they each grabbed a copy of break with a banshee, and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleys were standing with Hermione_Granger's_father and Hermione_Granger's_mother. ‘oh, there you are, good,’ said Molly_Weasley. she sounded breathless and kept patting her hair. ‘we’ll be able to see him in a minute …’ Gilderoy_Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. the real lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue which exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard’s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair. a short, irRita_Skeeterble-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash. ‘out of the way, there,’ he snarled at Ronald_Weasley moving back to get a better shot. ‘this is for the daily prophet.’ ‘big deal,’ said Ronald_Weasley rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it. Gilderoy_Lockhart heard him. he looked up. he saw Ronald_Weasley – and then he saw Harry_Potter. he stared. then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, ‘it can’t be Harry_Potter?’ the crowd parted, whispering excitedly. lockhart dived forward, seized Harry_Potter’s arm and pulled him to the front. the crowd burst into applause. Harry_Potter’s face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the weasleys. ‘nice big smile, Harry_Potter,’ said lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth. ‘together, you and i are worth the front page.’  when he finally let go of Harry_Potter’s hand, Harry_Potter could hardly feel his fingers. he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys, but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side. ‘ladies and gentlemen,’ he said loudly, waving for quiet. ‘what an extraordinary moment this is! the perfect moment for me to make a little announcement i’ve been sitting on for some time! ‘when young Harry_Potter here stepped into flourish and blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography – which i shall be happy to present him now, free of charge –’ the crowd applauded again, ‘– he had no idea,’ lockhart continued, giving Harry_Potter a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, ‘that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, magical me. he and his school fellows will, in fact, be getting the real, magical me. yes, ladies and gentlemen, i have great pleasure and pride in announcing that, this september, i will be taking up the post of defence against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry!’ the crowd cheered and clapped and Harry_Potter found himself being presented with the entire works of Gilderoy_Lockhart. staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginevra_Weasley was standing next to her new cauldron. ‘you have these,’ Harry_Potter mumbled to her, tipping the books into the cauldron. ‘i’ll buy my own –’ ‘bet you loved that, didn’t you, potter?’ said a voice Harry_Potter had no trouble recognising. he straightened up and found himself face to face with Draco_Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer. ‘famous Harry_Potter,’ said malfoy. ‘can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.’ ‘leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!’ said Ginevra_Weasley. it was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry_Potter. she was glaring at malfoy. ‘potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend!’ drawled malfoy. Ginevra_Weasley went scarlet as Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger fought their way over, both clutching stacks of lockhart’s books. ‘oh, it’s you,’ said Ronald_Weasley looking at malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. ‘bet you’re surprised to see Harry_Potter here, eh?’ ‘not as surprised as i am to see you in a shop, weasley,’ retorted malfoy. ‘i suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for that lot.’ Ronald_Weasley went as red as Ginevra_Weasley. he dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started towards malfoy, but Harry_Potter and Hermione_Granger grabbed the back of his Jack_Sloperet. ‘ron!’ said Arthur_Weasley, struggling over with Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley. ‘what are you doing? it’s mad in here, let’s go outside.’ ‘well, well, well – Arthur_Weasley.’ it was mr malfoy. he stood with his hand on Draco_Malfoy’s shoulder, sneering in just the same way. ‘Lucius_Malfoy,’ said Arthur_Weasley, nodding coldly. ‘busy time at the ministry, i hear,’ said mr malfoy. ‘all those raids … i Hope_Howell they’re paying you overtime?’ he reached into Ginevra_Weasley’s cauldron and extracted, from amidst the glossy lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of a beginner’s guide to transfiguration. ‘obviously not,’ he said. ‘dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?’ Arthur_Weasley flushed darker than either Ronald_Weasley or Ginevra_Weasley. ‘we have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, malfoy,’ he said. ‘clearly,’ said mr malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Hermione_Granger's_father and Hermione_Granger's_mother, who were watching apprehensively. ‘the company you keep, weasley … and i thought your family could sink no lower –’ there was a thud of metal as Ginevra_Weasley’s cauldron went flying; Arthur_Weasley had thrown himself at mr malfoy, knocking him backwards into a bookshelf. dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of ‘get him, dad!’ from Fred_Weasley or George_Weasley; Molly_Weasley was shrieking, ‘no, Arthur_Weasley, no!’; the crowd stampeded backwards, knocking more shelves over; ‘gentlemen, please – please!’ cried the assistant and then, louder than all, ‘break it up, there, gents, break it up –’ Rubeus_Hagrid was wading towards them through the sea of books. in an instant he had pulled Arthur_Weasley and mr malfoy apart. Arthur_Weasley had a cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools. he was still holding Ginevra_Weasley’s old transfiguration book. he thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with mAlice_Longbottom. ‘here, girl – take your book – it’s the best your father can give you –’ pulling himself out of Rubeus_Hagrid’s grip he beckoned to Draco_Malfoy and swept from the shop. ‘yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur_Weasley,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, almost lifting mr weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. ‘rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that. no malfoy’s worth listenin’ ter. bad blood, that’s what it is. come on now – let’s get outta here.’ the assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Rubeus_Hagrid’s waist and seemed to think better of it. they hurried up the street, Hermione_Granger's_father and Hermione_Granger's_mother shaking with fright and Molly_Weasley beside herself with fury. ‘a fine example to set to your children … brawling in public … what Gilderoy_Lockhart must’ve thought …’ ‘he was pleased,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘didn’t you hear him as we were leaving? he was asking that bloke from the daily prophet if he’d be able to work the fight into his report – said it was all publicity.’ but it was a subdued group who headed back to the fireside in the leaky cauldron, where Harry_Potter, the weasleys and all their shopping would be travelling back to the burrow using floo powder. they said goodbye to Hermione_Granger's_father and Hermione_Granger's_mother, who were leaving the pub for the muggle street on the other side. Arthur_Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Molly_Weasley’s face. Harry_Potter took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder. it definitely wasn’t his favourite way to travel.
