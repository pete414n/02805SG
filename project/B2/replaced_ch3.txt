— chapter three — the burrow ‘ron!’ breathed Harry_Potter, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars. ‘ron, how did you – what the –?’ Harry_Potter’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him. Ronald_Weasley was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in mid-air. grinning at Harry_Potter from the front seats were Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley, ron’s elder twin brothers. ‘all right, Harry_Potter?’ ‘what’s been going on?’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘why haven’t you been answering my letters? i’ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then dad came home and said you’d got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles …’ ‘it wasn’t me – and how did he know?’ ‘he works for the ministry,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘you know we’re not supposed to do spells outside school –’ ‘bit rich coming from you,’ said Harry_Potter, staring at the floating car. ‘oh, this doesn’t count,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘we’re only borrowing this, it’s dad’s, we didn’t enchant it. but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with …’ ‘i told you, i didn’t – but it’ll take too long to explain now. look, can you explain to them at hogwarts that Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley have locked me up and won’t let me come back, and obviously i can’t magic myself out, because the ministry’ll think that’s the second spell i’ve done in three days, so –’ ‘stop gibbering,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘we’ve come to take you home with us.’ ‘but you can’t magic me out either –’ ‘we don’t need to,’ said Ronald_Weasley jerking his head towards the front seats and grinning. ‘you forget who i’ve got with me.’ ‘tie that round the bars,’ said Fred_Weasley, throwing the end of a rope to Harry_Potter. ‘if Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley wake up, i’m dead,’ said Harry_Potter, as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred_Weasley revved up the car. ‘don’t worry,’ said Fred_Weasley, ‘and stand back.’   Harry_Potter moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realised how important this was and kept still and silent. the car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred_Weasley drove straight up in the air – Harry_Potter ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. panting, Ronald_Weasley hoisted them up into the car. Harry_Potter listened anxiously, but there was no sound from Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley’ bedroom. when the bars were safely in the back seat with Ronald_Weasley Fred_Weasley reversed as close as possible to Harry_Potter’s window. ‘get in,’ Ronald_Weasley said. ‘but all my hogwarts stuff … my wand … my broomstick …’ ‘where is it?’ ‘locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and i can’t get out of this room –’ ‘no problem,’ said George_Weasley from the front passenger seat. ‘out of the way, Harry_Potter.’ Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley climbed carefully through the window into Harry_Potter’s room. you had to hand it to them, thought Harry_Potter, as George_Weasley took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock. ‘a lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing this sort of muggle trick,’ said Fred_Weasley, ‘but we feel they’re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.’ there was a small click and the door swung open. ‘so – we’ll get your trunk – you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ronald_Weasley’ whispered George_Weasley. ‘watch out for the bottom stair, it creaks,’ Harry_Potter whispered back, as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing. Harry_Potter dashed around his room, collecting his things together and passing them out of the window to Ronald_Weasley then he went to help Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry_Potter heard uncle Vernon_Dursley cough. at last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through Harry_Potter’s room to the open window. Fred_Weasley climbed back into the car to pull with Ronald_Weasley and Harry_Potter and George_Weasley pushed from the bedroom side. inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window. uncle Vernon_Dursley coughed again. ‘a bit more,’ panted Fred_Weasley, who was pulling from inside the car, ‘one good push …’ Harry_Potter and George_Weasley threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car. ‘ok, let’s go,’ George_Weasley whispered. but as Harry_Potter climbed onto the window-sill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of uncle Vernon_Dursley’s voice. ‘that ruddy owl!’ ‘i’ve forgotten Hedwig!’ Harry_Potter tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on. he snatched up Hedwig’s cage, dashed to the window and passed it out to Ronald_Weasley he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle Vernon_Dursley hammered on the unlocked door – and it crashed open. for a split second, uncle Vernon_Dursley stood framed in the doorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry_Potter, grabbing him by the ankle. Ronald_Weasley Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley seized Harry_Potter’s arms and pulled as hard as they could. ‘Petunia_Dursley!’ roared uncle Vernon_Dursley. ‘he’s getting away! he’s getting away!’ the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry_Potter’s leg slid out of uncle Vernon_Dursley’s grasp. as soon as Harry_Potter was in the car and had slammed the door shut, Ronald_Weasley yelled, ‘put your foot down, Fred_Weasley!’ and the car shot suddenly towards the moon. Harry_Potter couldn’t believe it – he was free. he wound down the window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of privet drive. uncle Vernon_Dursley, aunt Petunia_Dursley and Dudley_Dursley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry_Potter’s window. ‘see you next summer!’ Harry_Potter yelled. the weasleys roared with laughter and Harry_Potter settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear. ‘let Hedwig out,’ he told Ronald_Weasley ‘she can fly behind us. she hasn’t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.’ George_Weasley handed the hairpin to Ronald_Weasley and a moment later, Hedwig had soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost. ‘so – what’s the story, Harry_Potter?’ said Ronald_Weasley impatiently. ‘what’s been happening?’ Harry_Potter told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d given Harry_Potter and the fiasco of the violet pudding. there was a long shocked silence when he had finished. ‘very fishy,’ said Fred_Weasley finally. ‘definitely dodgy,’ agreed George_Weasley. ‘so he wouldn’t even tell you who’s supposed to be plotting all this stuff?’ ‘i don’t think he could,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘i told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.’ he saw Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley look at each other. ‘what, you think he was lying to me?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘well,’ said Fred_Weasley, ‘put it this way – house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can’t usually use it without their masters’ permission. i reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts. someone’s idea of a joke. can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?’ ‘yes,’ said Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley together, instantly. ‘Draco_Malfoy,’ Harry_Potter explained. ‘he hates me.’ ‘Draco_Malfoy?’ said George_Weasley, turning round. ‘not Lucius_Malfoy’s son?’ ‘must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘why?’ ‘i’ve heard dad talking about him,’ said George_Weasley. ‘he was a big supporter of you know who.’ ‘and when you know who disappeared,’ said Fred_Weasley, craning around to look at Harry_Potter, ‘Lucius_Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it. load of Mundungus_Fletcher – dad reckons he was right in you know who’s inner circle.’ Harry_Potter had heard these rumours about malfoy’s family before, and they didn’t surprise him at all. Draco_Malfoy made Dudley_Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful and sensitive boy. ‘i don’t know whether the malfoys own a house-elf …’ said Harry_Potter. ‘well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they’ll be rich,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘yeah, mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,’ said George_Weasley. ‘but all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. house-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that, you wouldn’t catch one in our house …’ Harry_Potter was silent. judging by the fact that Draco_Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house. sending the family servant to stop Harry_Potter going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do. had Harry_Potter been stupid to take Dobby seriously? ‘i’m glad we came to get you, anyway,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘i was getting really worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters. i thought it was Errol’s fault at first –’ ‘who’s Errol?’ ‘our owl. he’s ancient. it wouldn’t be the first time he’d collapsed on a delivery. so then i tried to borrow Hermes –’ ‘who?’ ‘the owl mum and dad bought Percy_Weasley when he was made a prefect,’ said Fred_Weasley from the front. ‘but Percy_Weasley wouldn’t lend him to me,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘said he needed him.’ ‘Percy_Weasley’s been acting very oddly this summer,’ said George_Weasley, frowning. ‘and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room … i mean, there’s only so many times you can polish a prefect badge … you’re driving too far west, Fred_Weasley,’ he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred_Weasley twiddled the steering wheel. ‘so, does your dad know you’ve got the car?’ said Harry_Potter, guessing the answer. ‘er, no,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘he had to work tonight. Hope_Howellfully we’ll be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it.’ ‘what does your dad do at the ministry of magic, anyway?’ ‘he works in the most boring department,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘the misuse of muggle artefacts office.’ ‘the what?’ ‘it’s all to do with bewitching things that are muggle-made, you know, in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house. like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. this muggle woman bought it, took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it. it was a nightmare – dad was working overtime for weeks.’ ‘what happened?’ ‘the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. dad was going frantic, it’s only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office, and they had to do memory charms and all sorts to cover it up …’ ‘but your dad … this car …’ Fred_Weasley laughed. ‘yeah, dad’s mad about everything to do with muggles, our shed’s full of muggle stuff. he takes it apart, puts spells on it and puts it back together again. if he raided our house he’d have to put himself straight under arrest. it drives mum mad.’ ‘that’s the main road,’ said George_Weasley, peering down through the windscreen. ‘we’ll be there in ten minutes … just as well, it’s getting light …’ a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east. Fred_Weasley brought the car lower and Harry_Potter saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees. ‘we’re a little way outside the village,’ said George_Weasley. ‘ottery st catchpole …’ lower and lower went the flying car. the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees. ‘touchdown!’ said Fred_Weasley as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground. they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and Harry_Potter looked out for the first time at ron’s house. it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigsty, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several storeys high and so crooked it looked as though it was held up by magic (which, Harry_Potter reminded himself, it probably was). four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. a lop-sided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read ‘the burrow’. round the front door lay a jumble of wellington boots and a very rusty cauldron. several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard. ‘it’s not much,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘it’s brilliant,’ said Harry_Potter happily, thinking of privet drive. they got out of the car. ‘now, we’ll go upstairs really quietly,’ said Fred_Weasley, ‘and wait for mum to call us for breakfast. then Ronald_Weasley you come bounding downstairs going, ‘mum, look who turned up in the night!’ and she’ll be all pleased to see Harry_Potter and no one need ever know we flew the car.’ ‘right,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘come on, Harry_Potter, i sleep at the –’ Ronald_Weasley had gone a nasty greenish colour, his eyes fixed on the house. the other three wheeled around. Molly_Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-faCedric_Diggory woman, it was remarkable how much she looked like a sabre-toothed tiger. ‘ah,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘oh dear,’ said George_Weasley. Molly_Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the next. she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket. ‘so,’ she said. ‘morning, mum,’ said George_Weasley, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice. ‘have you any idea how worried i’ve been?’ said Molly_Weasley in a deadly whisper. ‘sorry, mum, but see, we had to –’ all three of Molly_Weasley’s sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them. ‘beds empty! no note! car gone … could have crashed … out of my mind with worry … did you care? … never, as long as i’ve lived … you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from William_Weasley or Charles_Weasley or Percy_Weasley …’ ‘perfect Percy_Weasley,’ muttered Fred_Weasley. ‘you could do with taking a leaf out of Percy_Weasley’s book!’ yelled Molly_Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred_Weasley’s chest. ‘you could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job –’ it seemed to go on for hours. Molly_Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry_Potter, who backed away. ‘i’m very pleased to see you, Harry_Potter, dear,’ she said, ‘come in and have some breakfast.’ she turned and walked back into the house and Harry_Potter, after a nervous glance at Ronald_Weasley who nodded encouragingly, followed her. the kitchen was small and rather cramped. there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and Harry_Potter sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around. he had never been in a wizard house before. the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all. written around the edge were things like ‘time to make tea’, ‘time to feed the chickens’ and ‘you’re late’. books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like charm your own cheese, enchantment in baking and one minute feasts – it’s magic! and unless Harry_Potter’s ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announCedric_Diggory that coming up was ‘witching hour, with the popular singing sorceress, celestina warbeck’. Molly_Weasley was clattering around, Cook_of_The_Hanged_Maning breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan. every now and then she muttered things like ‘don’t know what you were thinking of’ and ‘never would have believed it’. ‘i don’t blame you, dear,’ she assured Harry_Potter, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. ‘Arthur_Weasley and i have been worried about you, too. just last night we were saying we’d come and get you ourselves if you hadn’t written back to Ronald_Weasley by friday. but really’ (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate), ‘flying an illegal car halfway across the country – anyone could have seen you –’ she flicked her wand casually at the washing-up in the sink, which began to clean itself, clinking gently in the background. ‘it was cloudy, mum!’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘you keep your mouth closed while you’re eating!’ Molly_Weasley snapped. ‘they were starving him, mum!’ said George_Weasley. ‘and you!’ said Molly_Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry_Potter bread and buttering it for him. at that moment, there was a diversion in the form of a small, red-headed figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again. ‘Ginevra_Weasley,’ said Ronald_Weasley in an undertone to Harry_Potter. ‘my sister. she’s been talking about you all summer.’ ‘yeah, she’ll be wanting your autograph, Harry_Potter,’ grinned Fred_Weasley, but he caught his mother’s eye and bent his face over his plate without another word. nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time. ‘blimey, i’m tired,’ yawned Fred_Weasley, setting down his knife and fork at last. ‘i think i’ll go to bed and –’ ‘you will not,’ snapped Molly_Weasley. ‘it’s your own fault you’ve been up all night. you’re going to de-gnome the garden for me, they’re getting completely out of hand again.’ ‘oh, mum –’ ‘and you two,’ she said, glaring at Ronald_Weasley and George_Weasley. ‘you can go up to bed, dear,’ she added to Harry_Potter. ‘you didn’t ask them to fly that wretched car.’ but Harry_Potter, who felt wide awake, said quickly, ‘i’ll help Ronald_Weasley i’ve never seen a de-gnoming –’ ‘that’s very sweet of you, dear, but it’s dull work,’ said Molly_Weasley. ‘now, let’s see what lockhart’s got to say on the subject.’ and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. George_Weasley groaned. ‘mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden.’ Harry_Potter looked at the cover of Molly_Weasley’s book. written across it in fancy gold letters were the words: Gilderoy_Lockhart’s guide to household pests. there was a big photograph on the front of a very good-looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. as always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry_Potter supposed was Gilderoy_Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all. Molly_Weasley beamed down at him. ‘oh, he is marvellous,’ she said, ‘he knows his household pests, all right, it’s a wonderful book …’ ‘mum fancies him,’ said Fred_Weasley, in a very audible whisper. ‘don’t be so ridiculous, Fred_Weasley,’ said Molly_Weasley, her cheeks rather pink. ‘all right, if you think you know better than lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there’s a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it.’ yawning and grumbling, the weasleys slouched outside with Harry_Potter behind them. the garden was large and, in Harry_Potter’s eyes, exactly what a garden should be. Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley wouldn’t have liked it – there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting – but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry_Potter had never seen spilling from every flowerbed and a big green pond full of frogs. ‘muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,’ Harry_Potter told Ronald_Weasley as they crossed the lawn. ‘yeah, i’ve seen those things they think are gnomes,’ said Ronald_Weasley bent double with his head in a peony bush. ‘like fat little father christmases with fishing rods …’ there was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered and Ronald_Weasley straightened up. ‘this is a gnome,’ he said grimly. ‘gerroff me! gerroff me!’ squealed the gnome. it was certainly nothing like father christmas. it was small and leathery- looking, with a large, knobbly, bald head exactly like a potato. Ronald_Weasley held it at arm’s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside-down. ‘this is what you have to do,’ he said. he raised the gnome above his head (‘gerroff me!’) and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. seeing the shocked look on Harry_Potter’s face, Ronald_Weasley added, ‘it doesn’t hurt them – you’ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes.’ he let go of the gnome’s ankles: it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge. ‘pitiful,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘i bet i can get mine beyond that stump.’ Harry_Potter learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry_Potter’s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until – ‘wow, Harry_Potter – that must’ve been fifty feet …’ the air was soon thick with flying gnomes. ‘see, they’re not too bright,’ said George_Weasley, seizing five or six gnomes at once. ‘the moment they know the de-gnoming’s going on they storm up to have a look. you’d think they’d have learned by now just to stay put.’ soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched. ‘they’ll be back,’ said Ronald_Weasley as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. ‘they love it here … dad’s too soft with them, he thinks they’re funny …’ just then, the front door slammed. ‘he’s back!’ said George_Weasley. ‘dad’s home!’ they hurried through the garden and back into the house. Arthur_Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed. he was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children’s. he was wearing long green robes which were dusty and travel-worn. ‘what a night,’ he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him. ‘nine raids. nine! and old MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned …’ Arthur_Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed. ‘find anything, dad?’ said Fred_Weasley eagerly. ‘all i got were a few shrinking door-keys and a biting kettle,’ yawned Arthur_Weasley. ‘there was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn’t my department, though. mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that’s the committee on experimental charms, thank goodness …’ ‘why would anyone bother making door-keys shrink?’ said George_Weasley. ‘just muggle-baiting,’ sighed Arthur_Weasley. ‘sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it … of course, it’s very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking – they’ll insist they just keep losing it. bless them, they’ll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it’s staring them in the face … but the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn’t believe –’ ‘like cars, for instance?’ Molly_Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Arthur_Weasley’s eyes jerked open. he stared guiltily at his wife. ‘c-cars, Molly_Weasley, dear?’ ‘yes, Arthur_Weasley, cars,’ said Molly_Weasley, her eyes flashing. ‘imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly.’ Arthur_Weasley blinked. ‘well, dear, i think you’ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if, er, he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth … there’s a loophole in the law, you’ll find … as long as he wasn’t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn’t –’ ‘Arthur_Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!’ shouted Molly_Weasley. ‘just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed! and for your information, Harry_Potter arrived this morning in the car you weren’t intending to fly!’ ‘Harry_Potter?’ said Arthur_Weasley blankly. ‘Harry_Potter who?’ he looked around, saw Harry_Potter and jumped. ‘good lord, is it Harry_Potter? very pleased to meet you, ron’s told us so much about –’ ‘your sons flew that car to Harry_Potter’s house and back last night!’ shouted Molly_Weasley. ‘what have you got to say about that, eh?’ ‘did you really?’ said Arthur_Weasley eagerly. ‘did it go all right? i-i mean,’ he faltered, as sparks flew from Molly_Weasley’s eyes, ‘that-that was very wrong, boys – very wrong indeed …’ ‘let’s leave them to it,’ Ronald_Weasley muttered to Harry_Potter, as Molly_Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. ‘come on, i’ll show you my bedroom.’ they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which zigzagged its way up through the house. on the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry_Potter just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap. ‘Ginevra_Weasley,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘you don’t know how weird it is for her to be this shy, she never shuts up normally –’ they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying ‘Ronald_Weasley’s room’. Harry_Potter stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked. it was like walking into a furnace: nearly everything in ron’s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. then Harry_Potter realised that Ronald_Weasley had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks and waving energetically. ‘your quidditch team?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘the chudley cannons,’ said Ronald_Weasley pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black cs and a speeding cannonball. ‘ninth in the league.’ ron’s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics which all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs, the mad muggle. ron’s magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frogspawn on the window-sill, next to his fat grey rat, scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun. Harry_Potter stepped over a pack of self-shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking, one by one, back through the weasleys’ hedge. then he turned to look at Ronald_Weasley who was watching him almost nervously, as though waiting for his opinion. ‘it’s a bit small,’ said Ronald_Weasley quickly. ‘not like that room you had with the muggles. and i’m right underneath the ghoul in the attic, he’s always banging on the pipes and groaning …’ but Harry_Potter, grinning widely, said, ‘this is the best house i’ve ever been in.’ ron’s ears went pink.
