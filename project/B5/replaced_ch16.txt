— chapter sixteen — in the hog’s head Hermione_Granger made no mention of Harry_Potter giving defence against the dark arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion. Harry_Potter’s detentions with umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ronald_Weasley had had four more quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to vanish their mice in transfiguration (Hermione_Granger had actually progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of september, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for snape. ‘i was wondering,’ Hermione_Granger said suddenly, ‘whether you’d thought any more about defence against the dark arts, Harry_Potter.’ ‘course i have,’ said Harry_Potter grumpily, ‘can’t forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us –’ ‘i meant the idea Ronald_Weasley and i had –’ Ronald_Weasley cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look. she frowned at him, ‘– oh, all right, the idea i had, then – about you teaching us.’ Harry_Potter did not answer at once. he pretended to be perusing a page of asiatic anti-venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his mind. he had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight. sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione_Granger had proposed it, but at others, he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with dark creatures and death eaters – found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons … ‘well,’ he said slowly, when he could no longer pretend to find asiatic anti-venoms interesting, ‘yeah, i – i’ve thought about it a bit.’ ‘and?’ said Hermione_Granger eagerly. ‘i dunno,’ said Harry_Potter, playing for time. he looked up at Ronald_Weasley ‘i thought it was a good idea from the start,’ said Ronald_Weasley who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure Harry_Potter was not going to start    shouting again. Harry_Potter shifted uncomfortably in his chair. ‘you did listen to what i said about a load of it being luck, didn’t you?’ ‘yes, Harry_Potter,’ said Hermione_Granger gently, ‘but all the same, there’s no point pretending that you’re not good at defence against the dark arts, because you are. you were the only person last year who could throw off the imperius curse completely, you can produce a patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can’t, Viktor_Krum always said –’ Ronald_Weasley looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck. rubbing it, he said, ‘yeah? what did Viktor_Krum say?’ ‘ho ho,’ said Hermione_Granger in a bored voice. ‘he said Harry_Potter knew how to do stuff even he didn’t, and he was in the final year at durmstrang.’ Ronald_Weasley was looking at Hermione_Granger suspiciously. ‘you’re not still in contact with him, are you?’ ‘so what if i am?’ said Hermione_Granger coolly, though her face was a little pink. ‘i can have a pen-pal if i –’ ‘he didn’t only want to be your pen-pal,’ said Ronald_Weasley accusingly. Hermione_Granger shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ronald_Weasley who was continuing to watch her, said to Harry_Potter, ‘well, what do you think? will you teach us?’ ‘just you and Ronald_Weasley yeah?’ ‘well,’ said Hermione_Granger, looking a mite anxious again. ‘well … now, don’t fly off the handle again, Harry_Potter, please … but i really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. i mean, we’re talking about defending ourselves against v-voldemort. oh, don’t be pathetic, Ronald_Weasley it doesn’t seem fair if we don’t offer the chance to other people.’ Harry_Potter considered this for a moment, then said, ‘yeah, but i doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. i’m a nutter, remember?’ ‘well, i think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you’ve got to say,’ said Hermione_Granger seriously. ‘look,’ she leaned towards him – Ronald_Weasley who was still watching her with a frown on his face, leaned forwards to listen too – ‘you know the first weekend in october’s a hogsmeade weekend? how would it be if we tell anyone who’s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over?’ ‘why do we have to do it outside school?’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘because,’ said Hermione_Granger, returning to the diagram of the chinese chomping cabbage she was copying, ‘i don’t think umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.’ * Harry_Potter had been looking forward to the weekend trip into hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying him. Sirius_Black had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of september; Harry_Potter knew they had made him angry by saying they didn’t want him to come – but he still worried from time to time that Sirius_Black might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway. what were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street towards them in hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco_Malfoy? ‘well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and about,’ said Ronald_Weasley when Harry_Potter discussed his fears with him and Hermione_Granger. ‘i mean, he’s been on the run for over two years, hasn’t he, and i know that can’t have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn’t he? and now he’s just shut up all the time with that ghastly elf.’ Hermione_Granger scowled at Ronald_Weasley but otherwise ignored the slight on Kreacher. ‘the trouble is,’ she said to Harry_Potter, ‘until v-voldemort – oh, for heaven’s sake, Ronald_Weasley – comes out into the open, Sirius_Black is going to have to stay hidden, isn’t he? i mean, the stupid ministry isn’t going to realise Sirius_Black is innocent until they accept that Albus_Dumbledore’s been telling the truth about him all along. and once the fools start catching real death eaters again, it’ll be obvious Sirius_Black isn’t one … i mean, he hasn’t got the mark, for one thing.’ ‘i don’t reckon he’d be stupid enough to turn up,’ said Ronald_Weasley bracingly. ‘Albus_Dumbledore’d go mad if he did and Sirius_Black listens to Albus_Dumbledore even if he doesn’t like what he hears.’ when Harry_Potter continued to look worried, Hermione_Granger said, ‘listen, Ronald_Weasley and i have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper defence against the dark arts, and there are a couple who seem interested. we’ve told them to meet us in hogsmeade.’ ‘right,’ said Harry_Potter vaguely, his mind still on Sirius_Black. ‘don’t worry, Harry_Potter,’ Hermione_Granger said quietly. ‘you’ve got enough on your plate without Sirius_Black, too.’ she was quite right, of course, he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with umbridge. Ronald_Weasley was even further behind with his work than Harry_Potter, because while they both had quidditch practice twice a week, Ronald_Weasley also had his prefect duties. however, Hermione_Granger, who was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more Winky clothes. Harry_Potter had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks. the morning of the hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. after breakfast they queued up in front of filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. with a slight pang, Harry_Potter remembered that if it hadn’t been for Sirius_Black, he would not have been going at all. when Harry_Potter reached filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry_Potter. then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry_Potter walked on, out on to the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day. ‘er – why was filch sniffing you?’ asked Ronald_Weasley as he, Harry_Potter and Hermione_Granger set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates. ‘i suppose he was checking for the smell of Mundungus_Fletcherbombs,’ said Harry_Potter with a small laugh. ‘i forgot to tell you …’ and he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius_Black and filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. to his slight surprise, Hermione_Granger found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself. ‘he said he was tipped off you were ordering Mundungus_Fletcherbombs? but who tipped him off?’ ‘i dunno,’ said Harry_Potter, shrugging. ‘maybe malfoy, he’d think it was a laugh.’ they walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village, the wind whipping their hair into their eyes. ‘malfoy?’ said Hermione_Granger, sceptically. ‘well … yes … maybe …’ and she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of hogsmeade. ‘where are we going, anyway?’ Harry_Potter asked. ‘the three broomsticks?’ ‘oh – no,’ said Hermione_Granger, coming out of her reverie, ‘no, it’s always packed and really noisy. i’ve told the others to meet us in the hog’s head, that other pub, you know the one, it’s not on the main road. i think it’s a bit … you know … dodgy … but students don’t normally go in there, so i don’t think we’ll be overheard.’ they walked down the main street past zonko’s wizarding joke shop, where they were not surprised to see Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley and Lee_Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side- street at the top of which stood a small inn. a battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture on it of a wild boar’s severed head, leaking blood on to the white cloth around it. the sign creaked in the wind as they approached. all three of them hesitated outside the door. ‘well, come on,’ said Hermione_Granger, slightly nervously. Harry_Potter led the way inside. it was not at all like the three broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. the hog’s head bar comprised one small, dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats. the bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. the floor seemed at first glance to be compressed earth, though as Harry_Potter stepped on to it he realised that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries. Harry_Potter remembered Rubeus_Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: ‘yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the hog’s head,’ he had said, explaining how he had won a dragon’s egg from a hooded stranger there. at the time Harry_Potter had wondered why Rubeus_Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the hog’s head. there was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth; two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry_Potter might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong yorkshire accents, and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. they could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly. ‘i don’t know about this, Hermione_Granger,’ Harry_Potter muttered, as they crossed to the bar. he was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch. ‘has it occurred to you umbridge might be under that?’ Hermione_Granger cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure. ‘umbridge is shorter than that woman,’ she said quietly. ‘and anyway, even if umbridge does come in here there’s nothing she can do to stop us, Harry_Potter, because i’ve double- and triple-checked the school rules. we’re not out of bounds; i specifically asked professor flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the hog’s head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. and i’ve looked up everything i can think of about study groups and homework groups and they’re definitely allowed. i just don’t think it’s a good idea if we parade what we’re doing.’ ‘no,’ said Harry_Potter drily, ‘especially as it’s not exactly a homework group you’re planning, is it?’ the barman sidled towards them out of a back room. he was a grumpy- looking old man with a great deal of long grey hair and beard. he was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry_Potter. ‘what?’ he grunted. ‘three butterbeers, please,’ said Hermione_Granger. the man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar. ‘six sickles,’ he said. ‘i’ll get them,’ said Harry_Potter quickly, passing over the silver. the barman’s eyes travelled over Harry_Potter, resting for a fraction of a second on his scar. then he turned away and deposited Harry_Potter’s money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around. the man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman. ‘you know what?’ Ronald_Weasley murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. ‘we could order anything we liked in here. i bet that bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn’t care. i’ve always wanted to try firewhisky –’ ‘you – are – a – prefect,’ snarled Hermione_Granger. ‘oh,’ said Ronald_Weasley the smile fading from his face. ‘yeah …’ ‘so, who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?’ Harry_Potter asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig. ‘just a couple of people,’ Hermione_Granger repeated, checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door. ‘i told them to be here about now and i’m sure they all know where it is – oh, look, this might be them now.’ the door of the pub had opened. a thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people. first came Neville_Longbottom with Dean_Thomas and Lavender_Brown, who were closely followed by Parvati_Patil and Padma_Patil with (Harry_Potter’s stomach did a back-flip) Cho_Chang and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna_Lovegood; then Katie_Bell, Alicia_Spinnet and Angelina_Johnson, Colin_Creevey and Dennis_Creevey, Ernest_Prangmacmillan, Justin_Finch-Fletchley, Hannah_Abbott, a hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name Harry_Potter did not know; three ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony_Goldstein, Michael_Corner and Terry_Boot; then Ginevra_Weasley, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry_Potter recognised vaguely as being a member of the hufflepuff quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred_Weasley and Fred_Weasley with their friend Lee_Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with zonko’s merchandise. ‘a couple of people?’ said Harry_Potter hoarsely to Hermione_Granger. ‘a couple of people?’ ‘yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,’ said Hermione_Granger happily. ‘ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?’ the barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. possibly, he had never seen his pub so full. ‘hi,’ said Fred_Weasley, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly, ‘could we have … twenty-five butterbeers, please?’ the barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irRita_Skeeterbly as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the bar. ‘cheers,’ said Fred_Weasley, handing them out. ‘cough up, everyone, i haven’t got enough gold for all of these …’ Harry_Potter watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred_Weasley and rummaged in their robes to find coins. he could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione_Granger. ‘what have you been telling people?’ he said in a low voice. ‘what are they expecting?’ ‘i’ve told you, they just want to hear what you’ve got to say,’ said Hermione_Granger soothingly; but Harry_Potter continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, ‘you don’t have to do anything yet, i’ll speak to them first.’ ‘hi, Harry_Potter,’ said Neville_Longbottom, beaming and taking a seat opposite him. Harry_Potter tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho_Chang had just smiled at him and sat down on ron’s right. her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry_Potter a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all. in twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna_Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. when everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. every eye was upon Harry_Potter. ‘er,’ said Hermione_Granger, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. ‘well – er – hi.’ the group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry_Potter. ‘well … erm … well, you know why you’re here. erm … well, Harry_Potter here had the idea – i mean’ (Harry_Potter had thrown her a sharp look) ‘i had the idea – that it might be good if people who wanted to study defence against the dark arts – and i mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that umbridge is doing with us –’ (Hermione_Granger’s voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) ‘– because nobody could call that defence against the dark arts –’ (‘hear, hear,’ said Anthony_Goldstein, and Hermione_Granger looked heartened) ‘– well, i thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.’ she paused, looked sideways at Harry_Potter, and went on, ‘and by that i mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just in theory but doing the real spells –’ ‘you want to pass your defence against the dark arts o.w.l. too, though, i bet?’ said Michael_Corner. ‘of course i do,’ said Hermione_Granger at once. ‘but more than that, i want to be properly trained in defence because … because …’ she took a great breath and finished, ‘because Tom_Riddle is back.’ the reaction was immediate and predictable. cho’s friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down herself; Terry_Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch; Padma_Patil shuddered, and Neville_Longbottom gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough. all of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry_Potter. ‘well … that’s the plan, anyway,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘if you want to join us, we need to decide how we’re going to –’ ‘where’s the proof Tom_Riddle’s back?’ said the blond hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice. ‘well, Albus_Dumbledore believes it –’ Hermione_Granger began. ‘you mean, Albus_Dumbledore believes him,’ said the blond boy, nodding at Harry_Potter. ‘who are you?’ said Ronald_Weasley rather rudely. ‘Zacharias_Smith,’ said the boy, ‘and i think we’ve got the right to know exactly what makes him say Tom_Riddle’s back.’ ‘look,’ said Hermione_Granger, intervening swiftly, ‘that’s really not what this meeting was supposed to be about –’ ‘it’s ok, Hermione_Granger,’ said Harry_Potter. it had just dawned on him why there were so many people there. he thought Hermione_Granger should have seen this coming. some of these people – maybe even most of them – had turned up in the Hope_Howells of hearing Harry_Potter’s story firsthand. ‘what makes me say Tom_Riddle’s back?’ he asked, looking Zacharias_Smith straight in the face. ‘i saw him. but Albus_Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn’t believe him, you won’t believe me, and i’m not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.’ the whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry_Potter spoke. Harry_Potter had the impression that even the barman was listening. he was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag, making it steadily dirtier. Zacharias_Smith said dismissively, ‘all Albus_Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric_Diggory got killed by Tom_Riddle and that you brought diggory’s body back to hogwarts. he didn’t give us details, he didn’t tell us exactly how diggory got murdered, i think we’d all like to know –’ ‘if you’ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when voldemort murders someone i can’t help you,’ Harry_Potter said. his temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. he did not take his eyes from Zacharias_Smith’s aggressive face, and was determined not to look at cho. ‘i don’t want to talk about Cedric_Diggory, all right? so if that’s what you’re here for, you might as well clear out.’ he cast an angry look in Hermione_Granger’s direction. this was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just how wild his story was. but none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias_Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry_Potter. ‘so,’ said Hermione_Granger, her voice very high-pitched again. ‘so … like i was saying … if you want to learn some defence, then we need to work out how we’re going to do it, how often we’re going to meet and where we’re going to –’ ‘is it true,’ interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry_Potter, ‘that you can produce a patronus?’ there was a murmur of interest around the group at this. ‘yeah,’ said Harry_Potter slightly defensively. ‘a corporeal patronus?’ the phrase stirred something in Harry_Potter’s memory. ‘er – you don’t know madam bones, do you?’ he asked. the girl smiled. ‘she’s my auntie,’ she said. ‘i’m Susan_Bones. she told me about your hearing. so – is it really true? you make a stag patronus?’ ‘yes,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘blimey, Harry_Potter!’ said lee, looking deeply impressed. ‘i never knew that!’ ‘mum told Ronald_Weasley not to spread it around,’ said Fred_Weasley, grinning at Harry_Potter. ‘she said you got enough attention as it was.’ ‘she’s not wrong,’ mumbled Harry_Potter, and a couple of people laughed. the veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat. ‘and did you kill a Basilisk with that sword in Albus_Dumbledore’s office?’ demanded Terry_Boot. ‘that’s what one of the portraits on the wall told me when i was in there last year …’ ‘er – yeah, i did, yeah,’ said Harry_Potter. Justin_Finch-Fletchley whistled; the creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and Lavender_Brown said ‘wow!’ softly. Harry_Potter was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly looking anywhere but at cho. ‘and in our first year,’ said Neville_Longbottom to the group at large, ‘he saved that philological stone –’ ‘philosopher’s,’ hissed Hermione_Granger. ‘yes, that – from Tom_Riddle,’ finished Neville_Longbottom. Hannah_Abbott’s eyes were as round as galleons. ‘and that’s not to mention,’ said Cho_Chang (Harry_Potter’s eyes snapped across to her; she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault) ‘all the tasks he had to get through in the triwizard tournament last year – getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantula and things …’ there was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. Harry_Potter’s insides were squirming. he was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself. the fact that Cho_Chang had just praised him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them. ‘look,’ he said, and everyone fell silent at once, ‘i … i don’t want to sound like i’m trying to be modest or anything, but … i had a lot of help with all that stuff …’ ‘not with the dragon, you didn’t,’ said Michael_Corner at once. ‘that was a seriously cool bit of flying …’ ‘yeah, well –’ said Harry_Potter, feeling it would be churlish to disagree. ‘and nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer,’ said Susan_Bones. ‘no,’ said Harry_Potter, ‘no, ok, i know i did bits of it without help, but the point i’m trying to make is –’ ‘are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?’ said Zacharias_Smith. ‘here’s an idea,’ said Ronald_Weasley loudly, before Harry_Potter could speak, ‘why don’t you shut your mouth?’ perhaps the word ‘weasel’ had affected Ronald_Weasley particularly strongly. in any case, he was now looking at Zacharias_Smith as though he would like nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias_Smith flushed. ‘well, we’ve all turned up to learn from him and now he’s telling us he can’t really do any of it,’ he said. ‘that’s not what he said,’ snarled Fred_Weasley. ‘would you like us to clean out your ears for you?’ enquired George_Weasley, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the zonko’s bags. ‘or any part of your body, really, we’re not fussy where we stick this,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘yes, well,’ said Hermione_Granger hastily, ‘moving on … the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry_Potter?’ there was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias_Smith folded his arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in Fred_Weasley’s hand. ‘right,’ said Hermione_Granger, looking relieved that something had at last been settled. ‘well, then, the next question is how often we do it. i really don’t think there’s any point in meeting less than once a week –’ ‘hang on,’ said Angelina_Johnson, ‘we need to make sure this doesn’t clash with our quidditch practice.’ ‘no,’ said cho, ‘nor with ours.’ ‘nor ours,’ added Zacharias_Smith. ‘i’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,’ said Hermione_Granger, slightly impatiently, ‘but you know, this is rather important, we’re talking about learning to defend ourselves against v-voldemort’s death eaters –’ ‘well said!’ barked Ernest_Prangmacmillan, who Harry_Potter had been expecting to speak long before this. ‘personally, i think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we’ll do this year, even with our o.w.l.s coming up!’ he looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry ‘surely not!’ when nobody spoke, he went on, ‘i, personally, am at a loss to see why the ministry has foisted such a useless teacher on us at this critical period. obviously, they are in denial about the return of Tom_Riddle, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells –’ ‘we think the reason umbridge doesn’t want us trained in defence against the dark arts,’ said Hermione_Granger, ‘is that she’s got some … some mad idea that Albus_Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army. she thinks he’d mobilise us against the ministry.’ nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna_Lovegood, who piped up, ‘well, that makes sense. after all, Cornelius_Fudge has got his own private army.’ ‘what?’ said Harry_Potter, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information. ‘yes, he’s got an army of heliopaths,’ said Luna_Lovegood solemnly. ‘no, he hasn’t,’ snapped Hermione_Granger. ‘yes, he has,’ said Luna_Lovegood. ‘what are heliopaths?’ asked Neville_Longbottom, looking blank. ‘they’re spirits of fire,’ said Luna_Lovegood, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever, ‘great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of –’ ‘they don’t exist, Neville_Longbottom,’ said Hermione_Granger tartly. ‘oh, yes, they do!’ said Luna_Lovegood angrily. ‘i’m sorry, but where’s the proof of that?’ snapped Hermione_Granger. ‘there are plenty of eye-witness accounts. just because you’re so narrow- minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you –’ ‘hem, hem,’ said Ginevra_Weasley, in such a good imitation of professor umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. ‘weren’t we trying to decide how often we’re going to meet and have defence lessons?’ ‘yes,’ said Hermione_Granger at once, ‘yes, we were, you’re right, Ginevra_Weasley.’ ‘well, once a week sounds cool,’ said Lee_Jordan. ‘as long as –’ began Angelina_Johnson. ‘yes, yes, we know about the quidditch,’ said Hermione_Granger in a tense voice. ‘well, the other thing to decide is where we’re going to meet …’ this was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent. ‘library?’ suggested Katie_Bell after a few moments. ‘i can’t see madam Irma_Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘maybe an unused classroom?’ said Dean_Thomas. ‘yeah,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘Minerva_McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry_Potter was practising for the triwizard.’ but Harry_Potter was pretty certain that Minerva_McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time. for all that Hermione_Granger had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious. ‘right, well, we’ll try to find somewhere,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘we’ll send a message round to everybody when we’ve got a time and a place for the first meeting.’ she rummaged in her bag and produCedric_Diggory parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say something. ‘i – i think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. but i also think,’ she took a deep breath, ‘that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we’re doing. so if you sign, you’re agreeing not to tell umbridge or anybody else what we’re up to.’ Fred_Weasley reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature, but Harry_Potter notiCedric_Diggory at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list. ‘er …’ said Zacharias_Smith slowly, not taking the parchment that George_Weasley was trying to pass to him, ‘well … i’m sure Ernest_Prangwill tell me when the meeting is.’ but Ernest_Prangwas looking rather hesitant about signing, too. Hermione_Granger raised her eyebrows at him. ‘i – well, we are prefects,’ Ernest_Prangburst out. ‘and if this list was found … well, i mean to say … you said yourself, if umbridge finds out –’ ‘you just said this group was the most important thing you’d do this year,’ Harry_Potter reminded him. ‘i – yes,’ said Ernest_Macmillan, ‘yes, i do believe that, it’s just –’ ‘Ernest_Macmillan, do you really think i’d leave that list lying around?’ said Hermione_Granger testily. ‘no. no, of course not,’ said Ernest_Macmillan, looking slightly less anxious. ‘i – yes, of course i’ll sign.’ nobody raised objections after Ernest_Macmillan, though Harry_Potter saw cho’s friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name. when the last person – Zacharias_Smith – had signed, Hermione_Granger took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. there was an odd feeling in the group now. it was as though they had just signed some kind of contract. ‘well, time’s ticking on,’ said Fred_Weasley briskly, getting to his feet. ‘George_Weasley, Lee_Jordan and i have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we’ll be seeing you all later.’ in twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave, too. Cho_Chang made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face, but her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so that Cho_Chang had little choice but to leave with her. as her friend ushered her through the door, Cho_Chang looked back and waved at Harry_Potter. ‘well, i think that went quite well,’ said Hermione_Granger happily, as she, Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley walked out of the hog’s head into the bright sunlight a few moments later. Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley were clutching their bottles of butterbeer. ‘that Zacharias_Smith bloke’s a wart,’ said Ronald_Weasley who was glowering after the figure of smith, just discernible in the distance. ‘i don’t like him much, either,’ admitted Hermione_Granger, ‘but he overheard me talking to Ernest_Prangand Hannah_Abbott at the hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could i say? but the more people the better really – i mean, Michael_Corner and his friends wouldn’t have come if he hadn’t been going out with Ginevra_Weasley –’ Ronald_Weasley who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front. ‘he’s what?’ spluttered Ronald_Weasley outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef. ‘she’s going out with – my sister’s going – what d’you mean, Michael_Corner?’ ‘well, that’s why he and his friends came, i think – well, they’re obviously interested in learning defence, but if Ginevra_Weasley hadn’t told Michael_Corner what was going on –’ ‘when did this – when did she –?’ ‘they met at the yule ball and got together at the end of last year,’ said Hermione_Granger composedly. they had turned into the high street and she paused outside scrivenshaft’s quill shop, where there was a handsome display of pheasant feather quills in the window. ‘hmm … i could do with a new quill.’ she turned into the shop. Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley followed her. ‘which one was Michael_Corner?’ Ronald_Weasley demanded furiously. ‘the dark one,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘i didn’t like him,’ said Ronald_Weasley at once. ‘big surprise,’ said Hermione_Granger under her breath. ‘but,’ said Ronald_Weasley following Hermione_Granger along a row of quills in copper pots, ‘i thought Ginevra_Weasley fancied Harry_Potter!’ Hermione_Granger looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head. ‘Ginevra_Weasley used to fancy Harry_Potter, but she gave up on him months ago. not that she doesn’t like you, of course,’ she added kindly to Harry_Potter while she examined a long black and gold quill. Harry_Potter, whose head was still full of cho’s parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ronald_Weasley who was positively quivering with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered. ‘so that’s why she talks now?’ he asked Hermione_Granger. ‘she never used to talk in front of me.’ ‘exactly,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘yes, i think i’ll have this one …’ she went up to the counter and handed over fifteen sickles and two knuts, with Ronald_Weasley still breathing down her neck. ‘ron,’ she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, ‘this is exactly why Ginevra_Weasley hasn’t told you she’s seeing michael, she knew you’d take it badly. so don’t harp on about it, for heaven’s sake.’ ‘what d’you mean? who’s taking anything badly? i’m not going to harp on about anything …’ Ronald_Weasley continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street. Hermione_Granger rolled her eyes at Harry_Potter and then said in an undertone, while Ronald_Weasley was still muttering imprecations about Michael_Corner, ‘and talking about Michael_Corner and Ginevra_Weasley … what about Cho_Chang and you?’ ‘what d’you mean?’ said Harry_Potter quickly. it was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold – had he been that obvious? ‘well,’ said Hermione_Granger, smiling slightly, ‘she just couldn’t keep her eyes off you, could she?’ Harry_Potter had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of hogsmeade was.
