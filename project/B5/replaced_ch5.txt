— chapter five — the order of the phoenix ‘your –?’ ‘my dear old mum, yeah,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘we’ve been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a permanent sticking charm on the back of the canvas. let’s get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up again.’ ‘but what’s a portrait of your mother doing here?’ Harry_Potter asked, bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them. ‘hasn’t anyone told you? this was my parents’ house,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘but i’m the last black left, so it’s mine now. i offered it to Albus_Dumbledore for headquarters – about the only useful thing i’ve been able to do.’ Harry_Potter, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and bitter Sirius_Black’s voice sounded. he followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement kitchen. it was scarcely less Gloomy_nuns than the hall above, a cavernous room with rough stone walls. most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room. a haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling. many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of them, littered with rolls of parchment, goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Arthur_Weasley and his eldest son William_Weasley were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table. Molly_Weasley cleared her throat. her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired man who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and jumped to his feet. ‘Harry_Potter!’ Arthur_Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him, and shaking his hand vIgor_Karkaroffously. ‘good to see you!’ over his shoulder Harry_Potter saw bill, who still wore his long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table. ‘journey all right, Harry_Potter?’ William_Weasley called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls at    once. ‘Alastor_Moody didn’t make you come via greenland, then?’ ‘he tried,’ said Nymphadora_Tonks, striding over to help William_Weasley and immediately toppling a candle on to the last piece of parchment. ‘oh no – sorry –’ ‘here, dear,’ said Molly_Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand. in the flash of light caused by Molly_Weasley’s charm Harry_Potter caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building. Molly_Weasley had seen him looking. she snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into bill’s already overladen arms. ‘this sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,’ she snapped, before sweeping off towards an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates. William_Weasley took out his wand, muttered, ‘evanesco!’ and the scrolls vanished. ‘sit down, Harry_Potter,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘you’ve met MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, haven’t you?’ the thing Harry_Potter had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore, then jerked awake. ‘some’n say m’name?’ MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher mumbled sleepily. ‘i ’gree with Sirius_Black …’ he raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginevra_Weasley giggled. ‘the meeting’s over, Mundungus_Fletcher,’ said Sirius_Black, as they all sat down around him at the table. ‘Harry_Potter’s arrived.’ ‘eh?’ said MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, peering balefully at Harry_Potter through his matted ginger hair. ‘blimey, so ’e ’as. yeah … you all right, ’arry?’ ‘yeah,’ said Harry_Potter. MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher fumbled nervously in his pockets, still staring at Harry_Potter, and pulled out a grimy black pipe. he stuck it in his mouth, ignited the end of it with his wand and took a deep pull on it. great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him within seconds. ‘owe you a ’pology,’ grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud. ‘for the last time, MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher,’ called Molly_Weasley, ‘will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, especially not when we’re about to eat!’ ‘ah,’ said MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher. ‘right. sorry, Molly_Weasley.’ the cloud of smoke vanished as MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher stowed his pipe back in his pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered. ‘and if you want dinner before midnight i’ll need a hand,’ Molly_Weasley said to the room at large. ‘no, you can stay where you are, Harry_Potter dear, you’ve had a long journey.’ ‘what can i do, Molly_Weasley?’ said Nymphadora_Tonks enthusiastically, bounding forwards. Molly_Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive. ‘er – no, it’s all right, Nymphadora_Tonks, you have a rest too, you’ve done enough today.’ ‘no, no, i want to help!’ said Nymphadora_Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair as she hurried towards the dresser, from which Ginevra_Weasley was collecting cutlery. soon, a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord, supervised by Arthur_Weasley, while Molly_Weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, more goblets and food from the pantry. Harry_Potter was left at the table with Sirius_Black and MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, who was still blinking at him mournfully. ‘seen old figgy since?’ he asked. ‘no,’ said Harry_Potter, ‘i haven’t seen anyone.’ ‘see, i wouldn’t ’ave left,’ said MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, leaning forward, a pleading note in his voice, ‘but i ’ad a business opportunity –’ Harry_Potter felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione_Granger’s bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around Harry_Potter’s legs, purring, then jumped on to Sirius_Black’s lap and curled up. Sirius_Black scratched him absent-mindedly behind the ears as he turned, still grim- faced, to Harry_Potter. ‘had a good summer so far?’ ‘no, it’s been lousy,’ said Harry_Potter. for the first time, something like a grin flitted across Sirius_Black’s face. ‘don’t know what you’re complaining about, myself.’ ‘what?’ said Harry_Potter incredulously. ‘personally, i’d have welcomed a dementor attack. a deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. you think you’ve had it bad, at least you’ve been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights … i’ve been stuck inside for a month.’ ‘how come?’ asked Harry_Potter, frowning. ‘because the ministry of magic’s still after me, and voldemort will know all about me being an animagus by now, Peter_Pettigrew will have told him, so my big disguise is useless. there’s not much i can do for the order of the phoenix … or so Albus_Dumbledore feels.’ there was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius_Black uttered Albus_Dumbledore’s name that told Harry_Potter that Sirius_Black, too, was not very happy with the headmaster. Harry_Potter felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather. ‘at least you’ve known what’s been going on,’ he said bracingly. ‘oh yeah,’ said Sirius_Black sarcastically. ‘listening to snape’s reports, having to take all his snide hints that he’s out there risking his life while i’m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time … asking me how the cleaning’s going –’ ‘what cleaning?’ asked Harry_Potter. ‘trying to make this place fit for human habitation,’ said Sirius_Black, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen. ‘no one’s lived here for ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old house-elf, and he’s gone round the twist – hasn’t cleaned anything in ages.’ ‘Sirius_Black,’ said MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, who did not appear to have paid any attention to the conversation, but had been minutely examining an empty goblet. ‘this solid silver, mate?’ ‘yes,’ said Sirius_Black, surveying it with distaste. ‘finest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the black family crest.’ ‘that’d come orf, though,’ muttered MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, polishing it with his cuff. ‘Fred_Weasley – George_Weasley – no, just carry them!’ Molly_Weasley shrieked. Harry_Potter, Sirius_Black and MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher looked round and, within a split second, they had dived away from the table. Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air towards them. the stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface; the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere; the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius_Black’s right hand had been seconds before. ‘for heaven’s sake!’ screamed Molly_Weasley. ‘there was no need – i’ve had enough of this – just because you’re allowed to use magic now, you don’t have to whip your wands out for every tiny little thing!’ ‘we were just trying to save a bit of time!’ said Fred_Weasley, hurrying forward to wrench the bread knife out of the table. ‘sorry, Sirius_Black, mate – didn’t mean to –’ Harry_Potter and Sirius_Black were both laughing; MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, who had toppled backwards off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet; Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from where his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness. ‘boys,’ Arthur_Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, ‘your mother’s right, you’re supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you’ve come of age –’ ‘none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!’ Molly_Weasley raged at the twins as she slammed a fresh flagon of butterbeer on to the table, and spilling almost as much again. ‘bill didn’t feel the need to apparate every few feet! Charles_Weasley didn’t charm everything he met! Percy_Weasley –’ she stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden. ‘let’s eat,’ said William_Weasley quickly. ‘it looks wonderful, Molly_Weasley,’ said lupin, ladling stew on to a plate for her and handing it across the table. for a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food. then Molly_Weasley turned to Sirius_Black. ‘i’ve been meaning to tell you, Sirius_Black, there’s something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. of course, it could just be a boggart, but i thought we ought to ask Alastor_Moody to have a look at it before we let it out.’ ‘whatever you like,’ said Sirius_Black indifferently. ‘the curtains in there are full of doxys, too,’ Molly_Weasley went on. ‘i thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.’ ‘i look forward to it,’ said Sirius_Black. Harry_Potter heard the sarcasm in his voice, but he was not sure that anyone else did. opposite Harry_Potter, Nymphadora_Tonks was entertaining Hermione_Granger and Ginevra_Weasley by transforming her nose between mouthfuls. screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry_Potter’s bedroom, her nose swelled to a beak-like protuberance that resembled snape’s, shrank to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because Hermione_Granger and Ginevra_Weasley were soon requesting their favourite noses. ‘do that one like aPigwidgeonsnout, Nymphadora_Tonks.’ Nymphadora_Tonks obliged, and Harry_Potter, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley_Dursley was grinning at him from across the table. Arthur_Weasley, William_Weasley and lupin were having an intense discussion about goblins. ‘they’re not giving anything away yet,’ said bill. ‘i still can’t work out whether or not they believe he’s back. course, they might prefer not to take sides at all. keep out of it.’ ‘i’m sure they’d never go over to Tom_Riddle,’ said Arthur_Weasley, shaking his head. ‘they’ve suffered losses too; remember that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham?’ ‘i think it depends what they’re offered,’ said lupin. ‘and i’m not talking about gold. if they’re offered the freedoms we’ve been denying them for centuries they’re going to be tempted. have you still not had any luck with ragnok, bill?’ ‘he’s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,’ said bill, ‘he hasn’t stopped raging about the bagman business, he reckons the ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know –’ a gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of bill’s words. Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley, Ronald_Weasley and MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher were rolling around in their seats. ‘… and then,’ choked MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, tears running down his face, ‘and then, if you’ll believe it, ’e says to me, ’e says, “’ere, Mundungus_Fletcher, where didja get all them toads from? ’cos some son of a bludger’s gone and Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoned all mine!” and i says, “Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoned all your toads, will, what next? so you’ll be wanting some more, then?” and if you’ll believe me, lads, the gormless garGoyle buys all ’is own toads back orf me for a lot more’n what ’e paid in the first place –’ ‘i don’t think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank you very much, MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher,’ said Molly_Weasley sharply, as Ronald_Weasley slumped forwards on to the table, howling with laughter. ‘beg pardon, Molly_Weasley,’ said MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher at once, wiping his eyes and winking at Harry_Potter. ‘but, you know, will Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoned ’em orf warty harris in the first place so i wasn’t really doing nothing wrong.’ ‘i don’t know where you learned about right and wrong, MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,’ said Molly_Weasley coldly. Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer; George_Weasley was hiccoughing. for some reason, Molly_Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius_Black before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry_Potter looked round at his godfather. ‘Molly_Weasley doesn’t approve of MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher,’ said Sirius_Black in an undertone. ‘how come he’s in the order?’ Harry_Potter said, very quietly. ‘he’s useful,’ Sirius_Black muttered. ‘knows all the crooks – well, he would, seeing as he’s one himself. but he’s also very loyal to Albus_Dumbledore, who helped him out of a tight spot once. it pays to have someone like Mundungus_Fletcher around, he hears things we don’t. but Molly_Weasley thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. she hasn’t forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.’ three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry_Potter’s jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something as the jeans had once been Dudley_Dursley’s). as he laid down his spoon there was a lull in the general conversation: Arthur_Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed; Nymphadora_Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now back to normal; and Ginevra_Weasley, who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase. ‘nearly time for bed, i think,’ said Molly_Weasley with a yawn. ‘not just yet, Molly_Weasley,’ said Sirius_Black, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry_Potter. ‘you know, i’m surprised at you. i thought the first thing you’d do when you got here would be to start asking questions about voldemort.’ the atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry_Potter associated with the arrival of dementors. where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. a frisson had gone around the table at the mention of voldemort’s name. lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary. ‘i did!’ said Harry_Potter indignantly. ‘i asked Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger but they said we’re not allowed in the order, so –’ ‘and they’re quite right,’ said Molly_Weasley. ‘you’re too young.’ she was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched on its arms, every trace of drowsiness gone. ‘since when did someone have to be in the order of the phoenix to ask questions?’ asked Sirius_Black. ‘Harry_Potter’s been trapped in that muggle house for a month. he’s got the right to know what’s been happen—’ ‘hang on!’ interrupted George_Weasley loudly. ‘how come Harry_Potter gets his questions answered?’ said Fred_Weasley angrily. ‘we’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven’t told us a single stinking thing!’ said George_Weasley. ‘“you’re too young, you’re not in the order,”’ said Fred_Weasley, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother’s. ‘Harry_Potter’s not even of age!’ ‘it’s not my fault you haven’t been told what the order’s doing,’ said Sirius_Black calmly, ‘that’s your parents’ decision. Harry_Potter, on the other hand –’ ‘it’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry_Potter!’ said Molly_Weasley sharply. the expression on her normally kind face looked dangerous. ‘you haven’t forgotten what Albus_Dumbledore said, i suppose?’ ‘which bit?’ Sirius_Black asked politely, but with the air of a man readying himself for a fight. ‘the bit about not telling Harry_Potter more than he needs to know,’ said Molly_Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words. Ronald_Weasley Hermione_Granger, Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley’s heads swivelled from Sirius_Black to Molly_Weasley as though they were following a tennis rally. Ginevra_Weasley was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open. lupin’s eyes were fixed on Sirius_Black. ‘i don’t intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly_Weasley,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘but as he was the one who saw voldemort come back’ (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name) ‘he has more right than most to –’ ‘he’s not a member of the order of the phoenix!’ said Molly_Weasley. ‘he’s only fifteen and –’ ‘and he’s dealt with as much as most in the order,’ said Sirius_Black, ‘and more than some.’ ‘no one’s denying what he’s done!’ said Molly_Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. ‘but he’s still –’ ‘he’s not a child!’ said Sirius_Black impatiently. ‘he’s not an adult either!’ said Molly_Weasley, the colour rising in her cheeks. ‘he’s not James_Potter_I, Sirius_Black!’ ‘i’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly_Weasley,’ said Sirius_Black coldly. ‘i’m not sure you are!’ said Molly_Weasley. ‘sometimes, the way you talk about him, it’s as though you think you’ve got your best friend back!’ ‘what’s wrong with that?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘what’s wrong, Harry_Potter, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like him!’ said Molly_Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius_Black. ‘you are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!’ ‘meaning i’m an irresponsible godfather?’ demanded Sirius_Black, his voice rising. ‘meaning you have been known to act rashly, Sirius_Black, which is why Albus_Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and –’ ‘we’ll leave my instructions from Albus_Dumbledore out of this, if you please!’ said Sirius_Black loudly. ‘Arthur_Weasley!’ said Molly_Weasley, rounding on her husband. ‘Arthur_Weasley, back me up!’ Arthur_Weasley did not speak at once. he took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he reply. ‘Albus_Dumbledore knows the position has changed, Molly_Weasley. he accepts that Harry_Potter will have to be filled in, to a certain extent, now that he is staying at headquarters.’ ‘yes, but there’s a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes!’ ‘personally,’ said lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius_Black at last, as Molly_Weasley turned quickly to him, Hope_Howellful that finally she was about to get an ally, ‘i think it better that Harry_Potter gets the facts – not all the facts, Molly_Weasley, but the general picture – from us, rather than a garbled version from … others.’ his expression was mild, but Harry_Potter felt sure lupin, at least, knew that some extendable ears had survived Molly_Weasley’s purge. ‘well,’ said Molly_Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, ‘well … i can see i’m going to be overruled. i’ll just say this: Albus_Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry_Potter to know too much, and speaking as someone who has Harry_Potter’s best interests at heart –’ ‘he’s not your son,’ said Sirius_Black quietly. ‘he’s as good as,’ said Molly_Weasley fiercely. ‘who else has he got?’ ‘he’s got me!’ ‘yes,’ said Molly_Weasley, her lip curling, ‘the thing is, it’s been rather difficult for you to look after him while you’ve been locked up in azkaban, hasn’t it?’ Sirius_Black started to rise from his chair. ‘Molly_Weasley, you’re not the only person at this table who cares about Harry_Potter,’ said lupin sharply. ‘Sirius_Black, sit down.’ Molly_Weasley’s lower lip was trembling. Sirius_Black sank slowly back into his chair, his face white. ‘i think Harry_Potter ought to be allowed a say in this,’ lupin continued, ‘he’s old enough to decide for himself.’ ‘i want to know what’s been going on,’ Harry_Potter said at once. he did not look at Molly_Weasley. he had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient with her Molly_Weasleycoddling. Sirius_Black was right, he was not a child. ‘very well,’ said Molly_Weasley, her voice cracking. ‘Ginevra_Weasley – Ronald_Weasley – Hermione_Granger – Fred_Weasley – George_Weasley – i want you out of this kitchen, now.’ there was instant uproar. ‘we’re of age!’ Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley bellowed together. ‘if Harry_Potter’s allowed, why can’t i?’ shouted Ronald_Weasley ‘mum, i want to hear!’ wailed Ginevra_Weasley. ‘no!’ shouted Molly_Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. ‘i absolutely forbid –’ ‘Molly_Weasley, you can’t stop Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley,’ said Arthur_Weasley wearily. ‘they are of age.’ ‘they’re still at school.’ ‘but they’re legally adults now,’ said Arthur_Weasley, in the same tired voice. Molly_Weasley was now scarlet in the face. ‘i – oh, all right then, Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley can stay, but Ronald_Weasley –’ ‘Harry_Potter’ll tell me and Hermione_Granger everything you say anyway!’ said Ronald_Weasley hotly. ‘won’t – won’t you?’ he added uncertainly, meeting Harry_Potter’s eyes. for a split second, Harry_Potter considered telling Ronald_Weasley that he wouldn’t tell him a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it. but the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other. ‘course i will,’ Harry_Potter said.ron and Hermione_Granger beamed.‘fine!’ shouted Molly_Weasley. ‘fine! Ginevra_Weasley – bed!’ Ginevra_Weasley did not go quietly. they could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall mrs black’s ear-splitting shrieks were added to the din. lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm. it was only after he had returned, closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again, that Sirius_Black spoke. ‘ok, Harry_Potter … what do you want to know?’ Harry_Potter took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him for the last month. ‘where’s voldemort?’ he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name. ‘what’s he doing? i’ve been trying to watch the muggle news, and there hasn’t been anything that looks like him yet, no funny deaths or anything.’ ‘that’s because there haven’t been any funny deaths yet,’ said Sirius_Black, ‘not as far as we know, anyway … and we know quite a lot.’ ‘more than he thinks we do, anyway,’ said lupin. ‘how come he’s stopped killing people?’ Harry_Potter asked. he knew voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone. ‘because he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘it would be dangerous for him. his comeback didn’t come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. he messed it up.’ ‘or rather, you messed it up for him,’ said lupin, with a satisfied smile. ‘how?’ Harry_Potter asked, perplexed. ‘you weren’t supposed to survive!’ said Sirius_Black. ‘nobody apart from his death eaters was supposed to know he’d come back. but you survived to bear witness.’ ‘and the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Albus_Dumbledore,’ said lupin. ‘and you made sure Albus_Dumbledore knew at once.’ ‘how has that helped?’ Harry_Potter asked. ‘are you kidding?’ said William_Weasley incredulously. ‘Albus_Dumbledore was the only one Tom_Riddle was ever scared of!’ ‘thanks to you, Albus_Dumbledore was able to recall the order of the phoenix about an hour after voldemort returned,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘so, what’s the order been doing?’ said Harry_Potter, looking around at them all. ‘working as hard as we can to make sure voldemort can’t carry out his plans,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘how d’you know what his plans are?’ Harry_Potter asked quickly. ‘Albus_Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,’ said lupin, ‘and Albus_Dumbledore’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.’ ‘so what does Albus_Dumbledore reckon he’s planning?’ ‘well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘in the old days he had huge numbers at his command: witches and wizards he’d bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful death eaters, a great variety of dark creatures. you heard him planning to recruit the giants; well, they’ll be just one of the groups he’s after. he’s certainly not going to try and take on the ministry of magic with only a dozen death eaters.’ ‘so you’re trying to stop him getting more followers?’ ‘we’re doing our best,’ said lupin. ‘how?’ ‘well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that Tom_Riddle really has returned, to put them on their guard,’ said bill. ‘it’s proving tricky, though.’ ‘why?’ ‘because of the ministry’s attitude,’ said Nymphadora_Tonks. ‘you saw Cornelius_Fudge after Tom_Riddle came back, Harry_Potter. well, he hasn’t shifted his position at all. he’s absolutely refusing to believe it’s happened.’ ‘but why?’ said Harry_Potter desperately. ‘why’s he being so stupid? if Albus_Dumbledore –’ ‘ah, well, you’ve put your finger on the problem,’ said Arthur_Weasley with a wry smile. ‘Albus_Dumbledore.’ ‘fudge is frightened of him, you see,’ said Nymphadora_Tonks sadly. ‘frightened of Albus_Dumbledore?’ said Harry_Potter incredulously. ‘frightened of what he’s up to,’ said Arthur_Weasley. ‘fudge thinks Albus_Dumbledore’s plotting to overthrow him. he thinks Albus_Dumbledore wants to be minister for magic.’ ‘but Albus_Dumbledore doesn’t want –’ ‘of course he doesn’t,’ said Arthur_Weasley. ‘he’s never wanted the minister’s job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when Millicent_Bulstrode bagnold retired. fudge came to power instead, but he’s never quite forgotten how much popular support Albus_Dumbledore had, even though Albus_Dumbledore never applied for the job.’ ‘deep down, fudge knows Albus_Dumbledore’s much cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his ministry he was forever asking Albus_Dumbledore for help and advice,’ said lupin. ‘but it seems he’s become fond of power, and much more confident. he loves being minister for magic and he’s managed to convince himself that he’s the clever one and Albus_Dumbledore’s simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.’ ‘how can he think that?’ said Harry_Potter angrily. ‘how can he think Albus_Dumbledore would just make it all up – that i’d make it all up?’ ‘because accepting that voldemort’s back would mean trouble like the ministry hasn’t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,’ said Sirius_Black bitterly. ‘fudge just can’t bring himself to face it. it’s so much more comfortable to convince himself Albus_Dumbledore’s lying to destabilise him.’ ‘you see the problem,’ said lupin. ‘while the ministry insists there is nothing to fear from voldemort it’s hard to convince people he’s back, especially as they really don’t want to believe it in the first place. what’s more, the ministry’s leaning heavily on the daily prophet not to report any of what they’re calling Albus_Dumbledore’s rumour-mongering, so most of the wizarding community are completely unaware anything’s happened, and that makes them easy targets for the death eaters if they’re using the imperius curse.’ ‘but you’re telling people, aren’t you?’ said Harry_Potter, looking around at Arthur_Weasley, Sirius_Black, bill, MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, lupin and Nymphadora_Tonks. ‘you’re letting people know he’s back?’ they all smiled humourlessly. ‘well, as everyone thinks i’m a mad mass-murderer and the ministry’s put a ten thousand galleon price on my head, i can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets, can i?’ said Sirius_Black restlessly. ‘and i’m not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,’ said lupin. ‘it’s an occupational hazard of being a werewolf.’ ‘tonks and Arthur_Weasley would lose their jobs at the ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,’ said Sirius_Black, ‘and it’s very important for us to have spies inside the ministry, because you can bet voldemort will have them.’ ‘we’ve managed to convince a couple of people, though,’ said Arthur_Weasley. ‘tonks here, for one – she’s too young to have been in the order of the phoenix last time, and having aurors on our side is a huge advantage – Kingsley_Shacklebolt’s been a real asset, too; he’s in charge of the hunt for Sirius_Black, so he’s been feeding the ministry information that Sirius_Black is in tibet.’ ‘but if none of you are putting the news out that voldemort’s back –’ Harry_Potter began. ‘who said none of us are putting the news out?’ said Sirius_Black. ‘why d’you think Albus_Dumbledore’s in such trouble?’ ‘what d’you mean?’ Harry_Potter asked. ‘they’re trying to discredit him,’ said lupin. ‘didn’t you see the daily prophet last week? they reported that he’d been voted out of the chaIrma_Pincenship of the international confederation of wizards because he’s getting old and losing his grip, but it’s not true; he was voted out by ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing voldemort’s return. they’ve demoted him from chief warlock on the wizengamot – that’s the wizard high court – and they’re talking about taking away his order of merlin, first class, too.’ ‘but Albus_Dumbledore says he doesn’t care what they do as long as they don’t take him off the chocolate frog cards,’ said bill, grinning. to have Albus_Dumbledore  ‘it’s no laughing matter,’ said Arthur_Weasley sharply. ‘if he carries on defying the ministry like this he could end up in azkaban, and the last thing we want is locked up. while Tom_Riddle knows Albus_Dumbledore’s out there and wise to what he’s up to he’s going to go cautiously. if Albus_Dumbledore’s out of the way – well, Tom_Riddle will have a clear field.’ ‘but if voldemort’s trying to recruit more death eaters it’s bound to get out that he’s come back, isn’t it?’ asked Harry_Potter desperately. ‘voldemort doesn’t march up to people’s houses and bang on their front doors, Harry_Potter,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘he tricks, jinxes and blackmails them. he’s well- practised at operating in secret. in any case, gathering followers is only one thing he’s interested in. he’s got other plans too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he’s concentrating on those for the moment.’ ‘what’s he after apart from followers?’ Harry_Potter asked swiftly. he thought he saw Sirius_Black and lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius_Black answered. ‘stuff he can only get by stealth.’ when Harry_Potter continued to look puzzled, Sirius_Black said, ‘like a weapon. something he didn’t have last time.’ ‘when he was powerful before?’ ‘yes.’ ‘like what kind of weapon?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘something worse than the avada kedavra –?’ ‘that’s enough!’ Molly_Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry_Potter hadn’t noticed her return from taking Ginevra_Weasley upstairs. her arms were crossed and she looked furious. ‘i want you in bed, now. all of you,’ she added, looking around at Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger. ‘you can’t boss us –’ Fred_Weasley began. ‘watch me,’ snarled Molly_Weasley. she was trembling slightly as she looked at Sirius_Black. ‘you’ve given Harry_Potter plenty of information. any more and you might just as well induct him into the order straightaway.’ ‘why not?’ said Harry_Potter quickly. ‘i’ll join, i want to join, i want to fight.’ ‘no.’ it was not Molly_Weasley who spoke this time, but lupin. ‘the order is comprised only of overage wizards,’ he said. ‘wizards who have left school,’ he added, as Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley opened their mouths. ‘there are dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any of you … i think Molly_Weasley’s right, Sirius_Black. we’ve said enough.’ Sirius_Black half-shrugged but did not argue. Molly_Weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and Hermione_Granger. one by one they stood up and Harry_Potter, recognising defeat, followed suit.
