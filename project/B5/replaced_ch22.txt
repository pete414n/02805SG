— chapter twenty-two — st mungo’s hospital for magical maladies and injuries Harry_Potter was so relieved she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate, but jumped out of bed at once, pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glasses back on to his nose. ‘weasley, you ought to come too,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall. they followed professor Minerva_McGonagall past the silent figures of Neville_Longbottom, Dean_Thomas and Seamus_Finnigan, out of the dormitory, down the spiral stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole and off along the Fat_Lady’s moonlit corridor. Harry_Potter felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for Albus_Dumbledore; Arthur_Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately, and what if those Fangs (Harry_Potter tried hard not to think ‘my Fangs’) had been poisonous? they passed Mrs_Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly, but professor Minerva_McGonagall said, ‘shoo!’ Mrs_Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few minutes they had reached the stone garGoyle guarding the entrance to Albus_Dumbledore’s office. ‘fizzing whizzbee,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall. the garGoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator. the three of them stepped on to the moving stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin. though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room, a positive babble of them. it sounded as though Albus_Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people. professor Minerva_McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off. the door opened of its own accord and professor Minerva_McGonagall led Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley    inside. the room was in half-darkness; the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did; the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames. behind the door, a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing. ‘oh, it’s you, professor Minerva_McGonagall … and … ah.’ Albus_Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him. he was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt, but seemed wide-awake, his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon professor Minerva_McGonagall. ‘professor Albus_Dumbledore, potter has had a … well, a nightmare,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall. ‘he says …’ ‘it wasn’t a nightmare,’ said Harry_Potter quickly. professor Minerva_McGonagall looked round at Harry_Potter, frowning slightly. ‘very well, then, potter, you tell the headmaster about it.’ ‘i … well, i was asleep …’ said Harry_Potter and, even in his terror and his desperation to make Albus_Dumbledore understand, he felt slightly irRita_Skeeterted that the headmaster was not looking at him, but examining his own interlocked fingers. ‘but it wasn’t an ordinary dream … it was real … i saw it happen …’ he took a deep breath, ‘ron’s dad – Arthur_Weasley – has been attacked by a giant snake.’ the words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them, sounding slightly ridiculous, even comic. there was a pause in which Albus_Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ronald_Weasley looked from Harry_Potter to Albus_Dumbledore, white-faCedric_Diggory and shocked. ‘how did you see this?’ Albus_Dumbledore asked quietly, still not looking at Harry_Potter. ‘well … i don’t know,’ said Harry_Potter, rather angrily – what did it matter? ‘inside my head, i suppose –’ ‘you misunderstand me,’ said Albus_Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone. ‘i mean … can you remember – er – where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen? were you perhaps standing beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?’ this was such a curious question that Harry_Potter gaped at Albus_Dumbledore; it was almost as though he knew … ‘i was the snake,’ he said. ‘i saw it all from the snake’s point of view.’ nobody else spoke for a moment, then Albus_Dumbledore, now looking at Ronald_Weasley who was still whey-faCedric_Diggory, asked in a new and sHarper voice, ‘is Arthur_Weasley seriously injured?’ ‘yes,’ said Harry_Potter emphatically – why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they not realise how much a person bled when Fangs that long pierCedric_Diggory their side? and why could Albus_Dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him? but Albus_Dumbledore stood up, so quickly it made Harry_Potter jump, and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling. ‘Everard?’ he said sharply. ‘and you too, Dilys_Derwent!’ a sallow-faCedric_Diggory wizard with a short black fringe and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes immediately. ‘you were listening?’ said Albus_Dumbledore. the wizard nodded; the witch said, ‘naturally.’ ‘the man has red hair and glasses,’ said Albus_Dumbledore. ‘Everard, you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right people –’ both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of emerging in neighbouring pictures (as usually happened at hogwarts) neither reappeared. one frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair. Harry_Potter notiCedric_Diggory that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids, and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked. ‘Everard and Dilys_Derwent were two of hogwarts’s most celebrated heads,’ Albus_Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and professor Minerva_McGonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door. ‘their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important wizarding institutions. as they are free to move between their own portraits, they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere …’ ‘but Arthur_Weasley could be anywhere!’ said Harry_Potter. ‘please sit down, all three of you,’ said Albus_Dumbledore, as though Harry_Potter had not spoken, ‘Everard and Dilys_Derwent may not be back for several minutes. professor Minerva_McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs.’ professor Minerva_McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Albus_Dumbledore had conjured up at Harry_Potter’s hearing. Harry_Potter sat down, watching Albus_Dumbledore over his shoulder. Albus_Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkes’s plumed golden head with one finger. the phoenix awoke immediately. he stretched his beautiful head high and observed Albus_Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes. ‘we will need,’ Albus_Dumbledore said very quietly to the bird, ‘a warning.’ there was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone. Albus_Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry_Potter had never known, carried it over to his desk, sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand. the instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises. tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top. Albus_Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow furrowed. after a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air … a serpent’s head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry_Potter wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story: he looked eagerly at Albus_Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Albus_Dumbledore did not look up. ‘naturally, naturally,’ murmured Albus_Dumbledore apparently to himself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise. ‘but in essence divided?’ Harry_Potter could make neither head nor tail of this question. the smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both coiling and undulating in the dark air. with a look of grim satisfaction, Albus_Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand: the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze and vanished. Albus_Dumbledore replaCedric_Diggory the instrument on its spindly little table. Harry_Potter saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes, then, realising that Harry_Potter was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again. Harry_Potter wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly. ‘Albus_Dumbledore!’ ‘what news?’ said Albus_Dumbledore at once. ‘i yelled until someone came running,’ said the wizard, who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him, ‘said i’d heard something moving downstairs – they weren’t sure whether to believe me but went down to check – you know there are no portraits down there to watch from. anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later. he doesn’t look good, he’s covered in blood, i ran along to elfrida cragg’s portrait to get a good view as they left –’ ‘good,’ said Albus_Dumbledore as Ronald_Weasley made a convulsive movement. ‘i take it Dilys_Derwent will have seen him arrive, then –’ and moments later, the silver-ringleted witch had reappeared in her picture, too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, ‘yes, they’ve taken him to st mungo’s, Albus_Dumbledore … they carried him past my portrait … he looks bad …’ ‘thank you,’ said Albus_Dumbledore. he looked round at professor Minerva_McGonagall. ‘Minerva_McGonagall, i need you to go and wake the other weasley children.’ ‘of course …’ professor Minerva_McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door. Harry_Potter cast a sideways glance at Ronald_Weasley who was looking terrified. ‘and Albus_Dumbledore – what about Molly_Weasley?’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, pausing at the door. ‘that will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching,’ said Albus_Dumbledore. ‘but she may already know … that excellent clock of hers …’ Harry_Potter knew Albus_Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various weasley family members, and with a pang he thought that Arthur_Weasley’s hand must, even now, be pointing at mortal peril. but it was very late. Molly_Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock. Harry_Potter felt cold as he remembered Molly_Weasley’s boggart turning into Arthur_Weasley’s lifeless body, his glasses askew, blood running down his face … but Arthur_Weasley wasn’t going to die … he couldn’t … Albus_Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley he emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he plaCedric_Diggory carefully on his desk. he raised his wand and murmured, ‘portus!’ for a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue light; then it quivered to rest, as solidly black as ever. Albus_Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted wearing the slytherin colours of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Albus_Dumbledore’s voice when he attempted to rouse him. ‘Phineas_Nigellus_Black. Phineas_Nigellus_Black.’ the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their frames, the better to watch what was happening. when the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name, too. ‘Phineas_Nigellus_Black! Phineas_Nigellus_Black! Phineas_Nigellus_Black!’ he could not pretend any longer; he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide. ‘did someone call?’ ‘i need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas_Nigellus_Black,’ said Albus_Dumbledore. ‘i’ve got another message.’ ‘visit my other portrait?’ said Phineas_Nigellus_Black in a reedy voice, giving a long, fake yawn (his eyes travelling around the room and focusing on Harry_Potter). ‘oh, no, Albus_Dumbledore, i am too tired tonight.’ something about Phineas_Nigellus_Black’s voice was familiar to Harry_Potter, where had he heard it before? but before he could think, the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest. ‘insubordination, sir!’ roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard, brandishing his fists. ‘dereliction of duty!’ ‘we are honour-bound to give service to the present headmaster of hogwarts!’ cried a frail-looking old wizard whom Harry_Potter recognised as Albus_Dumbledore’s predecessor, Armando_Dippet. ‘shame on you, Phineas_Nigellus_Black!’ ‘shall i persuade him, Albus_Dumbledore?’ called a gimlet-eyed witch, raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod. ‘oh, very well,’ said the wizard called Phineas_Nigellus_Black, eyeing the wand with mild apprehension, ‘though he may well have desTroyed my picture by now, he’s done away with most of the family –’ ‘Sirius_Black knows not to desTroy your portrait,’ said Albus_Dumbledore, and Harry_Potter realised immediately where he had heard Phineas_Nigellus_Black’s voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in grimmauld place. ‘you are to give him the message that Arthur_Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife, children and Harry_Potter will be arriving at his house shortly. do you understand?’ ‘Arthur_Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry_Potter coming to stay,’ recited Phineas_Nigellus_Black in a bored voice. ‘yes, yes … very well …’ he sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the study door opened again. Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley and Ginevra_Weasley were ushered inside by professor Minerva_McGonagall, all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked, still in their night things. ‘Harry_Potter – what’s going on?’ asked Ginevra_Weasley, who looked frightened. ‘professor Minerva_McGonagall says you saw dad get hurt –’ ‘your father has been injured in the course of his work for the order of the phoenix,’ said Albus_Dumbledore, before Harry_Potter could speak. ‘he has been taken to st mungo’s hospital for magical maladies and injuries. i am sending you back to Sirius_Black’s house, which is much more convenient for the hospital than the burrow. you will meet your mother there.’ ‘how’re we going?’ asked Fred_Weasley, looking shaken. ‘floo powder?’ ‘no,’ said Albus_Dumbledore, ‘floo powder is not safe at the moment, the network is being watched. you will be taking a portkey.’ he indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk. ‘we are just waiting for Phineas_Nigellus_Black nigellus to report back … i want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you –’ there was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office, leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor. ‘it is Fawkes’s warning,’ said Albus_Dumbledore, catching the feather as it fell. ‘professor umbridge must know you’re out of your beds … Minerva_McGonagall, go and head her off – tell her any story –’ professor Minerva_McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan. ‘he says he’ll be delighted,’ said a bored voice behind Albus_Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas_Nigellus_Black had reappeared in front of his slytherin banner. ‘my great-great-grandson has always had an odd taste in house-guests.’ ‘come here, then,’ Albus_Dumbledore said to Harry_Potter and the weasleys. ‘and quickly, before anyone else joins us.’ Harry_Potter and the others gathered around Albus_Dumbledore’s desk. ‘you have all used a portkey before?’ asked Albus_Dumbledore, and they nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle. ‘good. on the count of three, then … one … two …’ it happened in a fraction of a second: in the infinitesimal pause before Albus_Dumbledore said ‘three’, Harry_Potter looked up at him – they were very close together – and Albus_Dumbledore’s clear blue gaze moved from the portkey to Harry_Potter’s face. at once, Harry_Potter’s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again – and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there Rose_Zeller within Harry_Potter a hatred so powerful he felt, for that instant, he would like nothing better than to strike – to bite – to sink his Fangs into the man before him – ‘… three.’ Harry_Potter felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground vanished from beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colours and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling them onwards … until his feet hit the ground so hard his knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground, and somewhere close at hand a voice said: ‘back again, the blood-traitor brats. is it true their father’s dying?’ ‘out!’ roared a second voice. Harry_Potter scrambled to his feet and looked around; they had arrived in the Gloomy_nuns basement kitchen of number twelve, grimmauld place. the only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle, which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper. Kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall, looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth; Sirius_Black was hurrying towards them all, looking anxious. he was unshaven and still in his day clothes; there was also a slightly MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher-like whiff of stale drink about him. ‘what’s going on?’ he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginevra_Weasley up. ‘Phineas_Nigellus_Black nigellus said Arthur_Weasley’s been badly injured –’ ‘ask Harry_Potter,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘yeah, i want to hear this for myself,’ said George_Weasley. the twins and Ginevra_Weasley were staring at him. Kreacher’s footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside. ‘it was –’ Harry_Potter began; this was even worse than telling Minerva_McGonagall and Albus_Dumbledore. ‘i had a – a kind of – vision …’ and he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake’s own eyes. Ronald_Weasley who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not speak. when Harry_Potter had finished, Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley and Ginevra_Weasley continued to stare at him for a moment. Harry_Potter did not know whether he was imagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks. well, if they were going to blame him just for seeing the attack, he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time. ‘is mum here?’ said Fred_Weasley, turning to Sirius_Black. ‘she probably doesn’t even know what’s happened yet,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘the important thing was to get you away before umbridge could interfere. i expect Albus_Dumbledore’s letting Molly_Weasley know now.’ ‘we’ve got to go to st mungo’s,’ said Ginevra_Weasley urgently. she looked around at her brothers; they were of course still in their pyjamas. ‘Sirius_Black, can you lend us cloaks or anything?’ ‘hang on, you can’t go tearing off to st mungo’s!’ said Sirius_Black. ‘course we can go to st mungo’s if we want,’ said Fred_Weasley, with a mulish expression. ‘he’s our dad!’ ‘and how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur_Weasley was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know?’ ‘what does that matter?’ said George_Weasley hotly. ‘it matters because we don’t want to draw attention to the fact that Harry_Potter is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of Miles_Bletchley away!’ said Sirius_Black angrily. ‘have you any idea what the ministry would make of that information?’ Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley looked as though they could not care less what the ministry made of anything. Ronald_Weasley was still ashen-faCedric_Diggory and silent. Ginevra_Weasley said, ‘somebody else could have told us … we could have heard it somewhere other than Harry_Potter.’ ‘like who?’ said Sirius_Black impatiently. ‘listen, your dad’s been hurt while on duty for the order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened, you could seriously damage the order’s –’ ‘we don’t care about the dumb order!’ shouted Fred_Weasley. ‘it’s our dad dying we’re talking about!’ yelled George_Weasley. ‘your father knew what he was getting into and he won’t thank you for messing things up for the order!’ said Sirius_Black, equally angry. ‘this is how it is – this is why you’re not in the order – you don’t understand – there are things worth dying for!’ ‘easy for you to say, stuck here!’ bellowed Fred_Weasley. ‘i don’t see you risking your neck!’ the little colour remaining in Sirius_Black’s face drained from it. he looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred_Weasley, but when he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm. ‘i know it’s hard, but we’ve all got to act as though we don’t know anything yet. we’ve got to stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right?’ Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley still looked mutinous. Ginevra_Weasley, however, took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it. Harry_Potter looked at Ronald_Weasley who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug, and they sat down too. the twins glared at Sirius_Black for another minute, then took seats either side of Ginevra_Weasley. ‘that’s right,’ said Sirius_Black encouragingly, ‘come on, let’s all … let’s all have a drink while we’re waiting. accio butterbeer!’ he raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the debris of Sirius_Black’s meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them. they all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table. Harry_Potter was only drinking to have something to do with his hands. his stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. they would not be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed. and it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that Arthur_Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked Arthur_Weasley in the first place. don’t be stupid, you haven’t got Fangs, he told himself, trying to keep calm, though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking, you were lying in bed, you weren’t attacking anyone … but then, what just happened in Albus_Dumbledore’s office? he asked himself. i felt like i wanted to attack Albus_Dumbledore, too … he put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to, and it slopped over on to the table. no one took any notice. then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and, as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather. ‘Fawkes!’ said Sirius_Black at once, snatching up the parchment. ‘that’s not Albus_Dumbledore’s writing – it must be a message from your mother – here –’ he thrust the letter into George_Weasley’s hand, who ripped it open and read aloud: ‘dad is still alive. i am setting out for st mungo’s now. stay where you are. i will send news as soon as i can. mum.’ George_Weasley looked around the table. ‘still alive …’ he said slowly. ‘but that makes it sound …’he did not need to finish the sentence. it sounded to Harry_Potter, too, as though Arthur_Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death. still exceptionally pale, Ronald_Weasley stared at the back of his mother’s letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred_Weasley pulled the parchment out of George_Weasley’s hands and read it for himself, then looked up at Harry_Potter, who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling. if Harry_Potter had ever sat through a longer night than this one, he could not remember it. Sirius_Black suggested once, without any real conviction, that they all go to bed, but the weasleys’ looks of disgust were answer enough. they mostly sat in silence around the table, watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, occasionally raising a bottle to their lips, speaking only to check the time, to wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure each other that if there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Molly_Weasley must long since have arrived at st mungo’s. Fred_Weasley fell into a doze, his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder. Ginevra_Weasley was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open; Harry_Potter could see them reflecting the firelight. Ronald_Weasley was sitting with his head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell. Harry_Potter and Sirius_Black looked at each other every so often, intruders upon the family grief, waiting … waiting … at ten past five in the morning by ron’s watch, the door swung open and Molly_Weasley entered the kitchen. she was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at her, Fred_Weasley, Ronald_Weasley and Harry_Potter half rising from their chairs, she gave a wan smile. ‘he’s going to be all right,’ she said, her voice weak with tiredness. ‘he’s sleeping. we can all go and see him later. bill’s sitting with him now; he’s going to take the morning off work.’ Fred_Weasley fell back into his chair with his hands over his face. George_Weasley and Ginevra_Weasley got up, walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her. Ronald_Weasley gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer in one. ‘breakfast!’ said Sirius_Black loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet. ‘where’s that accursed house-elf? Kreacher! Kreacher!’ but Kreacher did not answer the summons. ‘oh, forget it, then,’ muttered Sirius_Black, counting the people in front of him. ‘so, it’s breakfast for – let’s see – seven … bacon and eggs, i think, and some tea, and toast –’ Harry_Potter hurried over to the stove to help. he did not want to intrude on the weasleys’ happiness and he dreaded the moment when Molly_Weasley would ask him to recount his vision. however, he had barely taken plates from the dresser when Molly_Weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug. ‘i don’t know what would have happened if it hadn’t been for you, Harry_Potter,’ she said in a muffled voice. ‘they might not have found Arthur_Weasley for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you he’s alive and Albus_Dumbledore’s been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur_Weasley being where he was, you’ve no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis_Podmore …’ Harry_Potter could hardly bear her gratitude, but fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius_Black and thank him for looking after her children through the night. Sirius_Black said he was very pleased to have been able to help, and Hope_Howelld they would all stay with him as long as Arthur_Weasley was in hospital. ‘oh, Sirius_Black, i’m so grateful … they think he’ll be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer … of course, that might mean we’re here for christmas.’ ‘the more the merrier!’ said Sirius_Black with such obvious sincerity that Molly_Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast. ‘Sirius_Black,’ Harry_Potter muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer. ‘can i have a quick word? er – now?’ he walked into the dark pantry and Sirius_Black followed. without preamble, Harry_Potter told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had, including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Arthur_Weasley. when he paused for breath, Sirius_Black said, ‘did you tell Albus_Dumbledore this?’ ‘yes,’ said Harry_Potter impatiently, ‘but he didn’t tell me what it meant. well, he doesn’t tell me anything any more.’ ‘i’m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about,’ said Sirius_Black steadily. ‘but that’s not all,’ said Harry_Potter, in a voice only a little above a whisper. ‘Sirius_Black, i … i think i’m going mad. back in Albus_Dumbledore’s office, just before we took the portkey … for a couple of seconds there i thought i was a snake, i felt like one – my scar really hurt when i was looking at Albus_Dumbledore – Sirius_Black, i wanted to attack him!’ he could only see a sliver of Sirius_Black’s face; the rest was in darkness. ‘it must have been the aftermath of the vision, that’s all,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘you were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and –’ ‘it wasn’t that,’ said Harry_Potter, shaking his head, ‘it was like something Rose_Zeller up inside me, like there’s a snake inside me.’ ‘you need to sleep,’ said Sirius_Black firmly. ‘you’re going to have breakfast, then go upstairs to bed, and after lunch you can go and see Arthur_Weasley with the others. you’re in shock, Harry_Potter; you’re blaming yourself for something you only witnessed, and it’s lucky you did witness it or Arthur_Weasley might have died. just stop worrying.’ he clapped Harry_Potter on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving Harry_Potter standing alone in the dark. * everyone but Harry_Potter spent the rest of the morning sleeping. he went up to the bedroom he and Ronald_Weasley had shared over the last few weeks of summer, but while Ronald_Weasley crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry_Potter sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked Ronald_Weasley or else slithered through the house after one of the others … when Ronald_Weasley woke up, Harry_Potter pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too. their trunks arrived from hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so they could dress as muggles for the trip to st mungo’s. everybody except Harry_Potter was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts. when Nymphadora_Tonks and Alastor_Moody turned up to escort them across london, they greeted them gleefully, laughing at the bowler hat Alastor_Moody was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully, that Nymphadora_Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the underground. Nymphadora_Tonks was very interested in Harry_Potter’s vision of the attack on Arthur_Weasley, something Harry_Potter was not remotely interested in discussing. ‘there isn’t any seer blood in your family, is there?’ she enquired curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city. ‘no,’ said Harry_Potter, thinking of professor Sybill_Trelawney and feeling insulted. ‘no,’ said Nymphadora_Tonks musingly, ‘no, i suppose it’s not really prophecy you’re doing, is it? i mean, you’re not seeing the future, you’re seeing the present … it’s odd, isn’t it? useful, though …’ Harry_Potter didn’t answer; fortunately, they got out at the next stop, a station in the very heart of london, and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley to get between himself and Nymphadora_Tonks, who was leading the way. they all followed her up the escalator, moody clunking along at the back of the group, his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat, clutching his wand. Harry_Potter thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him. trying to avoid any more questions about his dream, he asked Alastor_Moody where st mungo’s was hidden. ‘not far from here,’ grunted moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with christmas shoppers. he pushed Harry_Potter a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind; Harry_Potter knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat. ‘wasn’t easy to find a good location for a hospital. nowhere in diagon alley was big enough and we couldn’t have it underground like the ministry – wouldn’t be healthy. in the end they managed to get hold of a building up here. theory was, sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd.’ he seized Harry_Potter’s shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets. ‘here we go,’ said moody a moment later. they had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red-brick department store called purge & dowse ltd. the place had a shabby, miserable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew, standing at random and modelling fashions at least ten years out of date. large signs on all the dusty doors read: ‘closed for refurbishment’. Harry_Potter distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, ‘it’s never open, that place …’ ‘right,’ said Nymphadora_Tonks, beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy. its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress. ‘everybody ready?’ they nodded, clustering around her. moody gave Harry_Potter another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Nymphadora_Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy, her breath steaming up the glass. ‘wotcher,’ she said, ‘we’re here to see Arthur_Weasley.’ Harry_Potter thought how absurd it was for Nymphadora_Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass, with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers. then he reminded himself that dummies couldn’t hear anyway. next second, his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger, and Nymphadora_Tonks had seized Ginevra_Weasley and Molly_Weasley by the elbows, stepped right through the glass and vanished. Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley and Ronald_Weasley stepped after them. Harry_Potter glanCedric_Diggory around at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of purge & dowse ltd; nor did any of them seem to have notiCedric_Diggory that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them. ‘c’mon,’ growled moody, giving Harry_Potter yet another poke in the back, and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side. there was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood. they were in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies of witch weekly, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. the room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises: a sweaty-faCedric_Diggory witch in the centre of the front row, who was fanning herself vIgor_Karkaroffously with a copy of the daily prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth; a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and, with each clang, his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady. witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and down the rows, asking questions and making notes on clipboards like umbridge’s. Harry_Potter notiCedric_Diggory the emblem embroidered on their chests: a wand and bone, crossed. ‘are they doctors?’ he asked Ronald_Weasley quietly. ‘doctors?’ said Ronald_Weasley looking startled. ‘those muggle nutters that cut people up? nah, they’re healers.’ ‘over here!’ called Molly_Weasley, above the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked enquiries. the wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like: a clean cauldron keeps potions from becoming poisons and antidotes are anti-don’ts unless approved by a qualified healer. there was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets which was labelled: Dilys_Derwent st mungo’s healer 1722–1741 headmistress of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 1741–1768 Dilys_Derwent was eyeing the weasley party as though counting them; when Harry_Potter caught her eye she gave a tiny wink, walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished. meanwhile, at the front of the queue, a young wizard was performing an odd on-the-spot jig and trying, in between yelps of pain, to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk. ‘it’s these – ouch – shoes my brother gave me – ow – they’re eating my – ouch – feet – look at them, there must be some kind of – aargh – jinx on them and i can’t – aaaaargh – get them off.’ he hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals. ‘the shoes don’t prevent you reading, do they?’ said the blonde witch,   irRita_Skeeterbly pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk. ‘you want spell damage, fourth floor. just like it says on the floor guide. next!’ as the wizard hobbled and pranCedric_Diggory sideways out of the way, the weasley party moved forward a few steps and Harry_Potter read the floor guide: artefact accidents .............................. ground floor cauldron explosion, wand backfiring, broom crashes, etc. creature-induCedric_Diggory injuries ................. first floor bites, stings, burns, embedded spines, etc. magical bugs .......................................... second floor contagious maladies, e.g. dragon pox, vanishing sickness, scrofungulus, etc. potion and plant poisoning ............ third floor rashes, regurgitation, uncontrollable giggling, etc. spell damage .......................................... fourth floor unliftable jinxes, hexes, incorrectly applied charms, etc. visitors’ tearoom / hospital shop ..... fifth floor if you are unsure where to go, incapable of normal speech or unable to remember why you are here, our welcome witch will be pleased to help. a very old, stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now. ‘i’m here to see BrodEric_Munchk_Bode!’ he wheezed. ‘ward forty-nine, but i’m afraid you’re wasting your time,’ said the witch dismissively. ‘he’s completely addled, you know – still thinks he’s a teapot. next!’ a harassed-looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large, feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit. ‘fourth floor,’ said the witch, in a bored voice, without asking, and the man         disappeared through the double doors beside the desk, holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon. ‘next!’ Molly_Weasley moved forward to the desk. ‘hello,’ she said, ‘my husband, Arthur_Weasley, was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning, could you tell us –?’ ‘Arthur_Weasley?’ said the witch, running her finger down a long list in front of her. ‘yes, first floor, second door on the right, dai llewellyn ward.’ ‘thank you,’ said Molly_Weasley. ‘come on, you lot.’ they followed her through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling, looking like giant soapsuds. more witches and wizards in lime-green robes walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door, and every now and then they heard distant Wailing_Widow. they climbed a flight of stairs and entered the creature-induCedric_Diggory injuries corridor, where the second door on the right bore the words: ‘dangerous’ dai llewellyn ward: serious bites. underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten: healer-in-charge: Hippocrates_Smethwyck. trainee healer: Augustus_Rookwood pye. ‘we’ll wait outside, Molly_Weasley,’ Nymphadora_Tonks said. ‘Arthur_Weasley won’t want too many visitors at once … it ought to be just the family first.’ Alastor_Moody growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall, his magical eye spinning in all directions. Harry_Potter drew back, too, but Molly_Weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door, saying, ‘don’t be silly, Harry_Potter, Arthur_Weasley wants to thank you.’ the ward was small and rather dingy, as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door. most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling. the walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather vicious-looking wizard on the wall, captioned: Urquhart_Rackharrow, 1612–1697, inventor of the entrail- expelling curse. there were only three patients. Arthur_Weasley was occupying the bed at the far end of the ward beside the tiny window. Harry_Potter was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the daily prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling on to his bed. he looked up as they walked towards him and, seeing who it was, beamed. ‘hello!’ he called, throwing the prophet aside. ‘bill just left, Molly_Weasley, had to get back to work, but he says he’ll drop in on you later.’ ‘how are you, Arthur_Weasley?’ asked Molly_Weasley, bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face. ‘you’re still looking a bit peaky.’ ‘i feel absolutely fine,’ said Arthur_Weasley brightly, holding out his good arm to give Ginevra_Weasley a hug. ‘if they could only take the bandages off, i’d be fit to go home.’ ‘why can’t they take them off, dad?’ asked Fred_Weasley. ‘well, i start bleeding like mad every time they try,’ said Arthur_Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay on his bedside cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all. ‘it seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snake’s Fangs that keeps wounds open. they’re sure they’ll find an antidote, though; they say they’ve had much worse cases than mine, and in the meantime i just have to keep taking a blood-replenishing potion every hour. but that fellow over there,’ he said, dropping his voice and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling. ‘bitten by a werewolf, poor chap. no cure at all.’ ‘a werewolf?’ whispered Molly_Weasley, looking alarmed. ‘is he safe in a public ward? shouldn’t he be in a private room?’ ‘it’s two weeks till full moon,’ Arthur_Weasley reminded her quietly. ‘they’ve been talking to him this morning, the healers, you know, trying to persuade him he’ll be able to lead an almost normal life. i said to him – didn’t mention names, of course – but i said i knew a werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite easy to manage.’ ‘what did he say?’ asked George_Weasley. ‘said he’d give me another bite if i didn’t shut up,’ said Arthur_Weasley sadly. ‘and that woman over there,’ he indicated the only other occupied bed, which was right beside the door, ‘won’t tell the healers what bit her, which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally. whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg, very nasty smell when they take off the dressings.’ ‘so, you going to tell us what happened, dad?’ asked Fred_Weasley, pulling his chair closer to the bed. ‘well, you already know, don’t you?’ said Arthur_Weasley, with a significant smile at Harry_Potter. ‘it’s very simple – i’d had a very long day, dozed off, got sneaked up on and bitten.’ ‘is it in the prophet, you being attacked?’ asked Fred_Weasley, indicating the newspaper Arthur_Weasley had cast aside. ‘no, of course not,’ said Arthur_Weasley, with a slightly bitter smile, ‘the ministry wouldn’t want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got –’ ‘Arthur_Weasley!’ Molly_Weasley warned him. ‘– got – er – me,’ Arthur_Weasley said hastily, though Harry_Potter was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say. ‘so where were you when it happened, dad?’ asked George_Weasley. ‘that’s my business,’ said Arthur_Weasley, though with a small smile. he snatched up the daily prophet, shook it open again and said, ‘i was just reading about Willy_Widdershins’s arrest when you arrived. you know Willy_Widdershins turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets back in the summer? one of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in –’ ‘when you say you were “on duty”,’ Fred_Weasley interrupted in a low voice, ‘what were you doing?’ ‘you heard your father,’ whispered Molly_Weasley, ‘we are not discussing this here! go on about Willy_Widdershins, Arthur_Weasley.’ ‘well, don’t ask me how, but he actually got off the toilet charge,’ said Arthur_Weasley grimly. ‘i can only suppose gold changed hands –’ ‘you were guarding it, weren’t you?’ said George_Weasley quietly. ‘the weapon? the thing Tom_Riddle’s after?’ ‘George_Weasley, be quiet!’ snapped Molly_Weasley. ‘anyway,’ said Arthur_Weasley, in a raised voice, ‘this time Willy_Widdershins’s been caught selling biting doorknobs to muggles and i don’t think he’ll be able to worm his way out of it because, according to this article, two muggles have lost fingers and are now in st mungo’s for emergency bone re-growth and memory modification. just think of it, muggles in st mungo’s! i wonder which ward they’re in?’ and he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost. ‘didn’t you say Tom_Riddle’s got a snake, Harry_Potter?’ asked Fred_Weasley, looking at his father for a reaction. ‘a massive one? you saw it the night he returned, didn’t you?’ ‘that’s enough,’ said Molly_Weasley crossly. ‘Alastor_Moody and Nymphadora_Tonks are outside, Arthur_Weasley, they want to come and see you. and you lot can wait outside,’ she added to her children and Harry_Potter. ‘you can come and say goodbye afterwards. go on.’ they trooped back into the corridor. Alastor_Moody and Nymphadora_Tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them. Fred_Weasley raised his eyebrows. ‘fine,’ he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, ‘be like that. don’t tell us anything.’ ‘looking for these?’ said George_Weasley, holding out what looked like a tangle of flesh-coloured string. ‘you read my mind,’ said Fred_Weasley, grinning. ‘let’s see if st mungo’s puts imperturbable charms on its ward doors, shall we?’ he and George_Weasley disentangled the string and separated five extendable ears from each other. Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley handed them around. Harry_Potter hesitated to take one. ‘go on, Harry_Potter, take it! you saved dad’s life. if anyone’s got the right to eavesdrop on him, it’s you.’ grinning in spite of himself, Harry_Potter took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done. ‘ok, go!’ Fred_Weasley whispered. the flesh-coloured strings wriggled like long skinny worms and snaked under the door. at first, Harry_Potter could hear nothing, then he jumped as he heard Nymphadora_Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him. ‘… they searched the whole area but couldn’t find the snake anywhere. it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur_Weasley … but you-know- who can’t have expected a snake to get in, can he?’ ‘i reckon he sent it as a lookout,’ growled moody, ‘’cause he’s not had any luck so far, has he? no, i reckon he’s trying to get a clearer picture of what he’s facing and if Arthur_Weasley hadn’t been there the beast would’ve had a lot more time to look around. so, potter says he saw it all happen?’ ‘yes,’ said Molly_Weasley. she sounded rather uneasy. ‘you know, Albus_Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry_Potter to see something like this.’ ‘yeah, well,’ said moody, ‘there’s something funny about the potter kid, we all know that.’ ‘Albus_Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry_Potter when i spoke to him this morning,’ whispered Molly_Weasley. ‘course he’s worried,’ growled moody. ‘the boy’s seeing things from inside Tom_Riddle’s snake. obviously, potter doesn’t realise what that means, but if Tom_Riddle’s possessing him –’ Harry_Potter pulled the extendable ear out of his own, his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face. he looked around at the others. they were all staring at him, the strings still trailing from their ears, looking suddenly fearful.
