— chapter seventeen — educational decree number twenty- four Harry_Potter felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term. he and Ronald_Weasley spent much of sunday catching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake. Hermione_Granger, who of course was up to date with all her work, brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her, producing more hats and scarves. knowing they were doing something to resist umbridge and the ministry, and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave Harry_Potter a feeling of immense satisfaction. he kept reliving saturday’s meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn defence against the dark arts … and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done … and Cho_Chang praising his performance in the triwizard tournament – knowing all those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favourite classes. he and Ronald_Weasley headed downstairs from their dormitory, discussing Angelina_Johnson’s idea that they were to work on a new move called the sloth grip roll during that night’s quidditch practice, and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people. a large sign had been affixed to the gryffindor noticeboard, so large it covered everything else on it – the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from Argus_Filch, the quidditch team training timetable, the offers to barter certain chocolate frog cards for others, the weasleys’ latest advertisement for testers, the dates of the hogsmeade    weekends and the lost and found notices. the new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature. by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts all student organisations, societies, teams, groups and clubs are henceforth disbanded. an organisation, society, team, group or club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more students. permission to re-form may be sought from the high inquisitor (professor umbridge). no student organisation, society, team, group or club may exist without the knowledge and approval of the high inquisitor. any student found to have formed, or to belong to, an organisation, society, team, group or club that has not been approved by the high inquisitor will be expelled. the above is in accordance with educational decree number twenty-four. signed: Dolores_Umbridge jane umbridge, high inquisitor Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley read the notice over the heads of some anxious-looking second-years. ‘does this mean they’re going to shut down the gobstones club?’ one of them asked his friend. ‘i reckon you’ll be ok with gobstones,’ Ronald_Weasley said darkly, making the second-year jump. ‘i don’t think we’re going to be as lucky, though, do you?’ he asked Harry_Potter as the second-years hurried away. Harry_Potter was reading the notice through again. the happiness that had filled him since saturday was gone. his insides were pulsing with rage. ‘this isn’t a coincidence,’ he said, his hands forming fists. ‘she knows.’          ‘she can’t,’ said Ronald_Weasley at once. ‘there were people listening in that pub. and let’s face it, we don’t know how many of the people who turned up we can trust … any of them could have run off and told umbridge …’ and he had thought they believed him, thought they even admired him … ‘Zacharias_Smith!’ said Ronald_Weasley at once, punching a fist into his hand. ‘or – i thought that Michael_Corner had a really shifty look, too –’ ‘i wonder if Hermione_Granger’s seen this yet?’ Harry_Potter said, looking round at the door to the girls’ dormitories. ‘let’s go and tell her,’ said Ronald_Weasley he bounded forwards, pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase. he was on the sixth stair when there was a loud, Wailing_Widow, klaxon-like sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide like a helter- skelter. there was a brief moment when Ronald_Weasley tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at Harry_Potter’s feet. ‘er – i don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’ dormitories,’ said Harry_Potter, pulling Ronald_Weasley to his feet and trying not to laugh. two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide. ‘oooh, who tried to get upstairs?’ they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley ‘me,’ said Ronald_Weasley who was still rather dishevelled. ‘i didn’t realise that would happen. it’s not fair!’ he added to Harry_Potter, as the girls headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. ‘Hermione_Granger’s allowed in our dormitory, how come we’re not allowed –?’ ‘well, it’s an old-fashioned rule,’ said Hermione_Granger, who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet, ‘but it says in hogwarts: a history, that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls. anyway, why were you trying to get in there?’ ‘to see you – look at this!’ said Ronald_Weasley dragging her over to the noticeboard. Hermione_Granger’s eyes slid rapidly down the notice. her expression became stony. ‘someone must have blabbed to her!’ Ronald_Weasley said angrily. ‘they can’t have done,’ said Hermione_Granger in a low voice. ‘you’re so naive,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘you think just because you’re all honourable and trustworthy –’ ‘no, they can’t have done, because i put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,’ said Hermione_Granger grimly. ‘believe me, if anyone’s run off and told umbridge, we’ll know exactly who they are and they will really regret it.’ ‘what’ll happen to them?’ said Ronald_Weasley eagerly. ‘well, put it this way,’ said Hermione_Granger, ‘it’ll make Eloise_Midgen midgeon’s acne look like a couple of cute freckles. come on, let’s get down to breakfast and see what the others think … i wonder whether this has been put up in all the houses?’ it was immediately apparent on entering the great hall that umbridge’s sign had not only appeared in gryffindor tower. there was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of movement in the hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what they had read. Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger had barely taken their seats when Neville_Longbottom, Dean_Thomas, Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley and Ginevra_Weasley descended upon them. ‘did you see it?’ ‘d’you reckon she knows?’ ‘what are we going to do?’ they were all looking at Harry_Potter. he glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near them. ‘we’re going to do it anyway, of course,’ he said quietly. ‘knew you’d say that,’ said George_Weasley, beaming and thumping Harry_Potter on the arm. ‘the prefects as well?’ said Fred_Weasley, looking quizzically at Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger. ‘of course,’ said Hermione_Granger coolly. ‘here come Ernest_Prangand Hannah_Abbott,’ said Ronald_Weasley looking over his shoulder. ‘and those ravenclaw blokes and smith … and no one looks very spotty.’ Hermione_Granger looked alarmed. ‘never mind spots, the idiots can’t come over here now, it’ll look really suspicious – sit down!’ she mouthed to Ernest_Prangand Hannah_Abbott, gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the hufflepuff table. ‘later! we’ll – talk – to – you – later!’ ‘i’ll tell michael,’ said Ginevra_Weasley impatiently, swinging herself off her bench, ‘the fool, honestly …’ she hurried off towards the ravenclaw table; Harry_Potter watched her go. Cho_Chang was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend she had brought along to the hog’s head. would umbridge’s notice scare her off meeting them again? but the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the great hall for history of magic. ‘Harry_Potter! Ronald_Weasley’ it was Angelina_Johnson and she was hurrying towards them looking perfectly desperate. ‘it’s ok,’ said Harry_Potter quietly, when she was near enough to hear him. ‘we’re still going to –’ ‘you realise she’s including quidditch in this?’ Angelina_Johnson said over him. ‘we have to go and ask permission to re-form the gryffindor team!’ ‘what?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘no way,’ said Ronald_Weasley appalled. ‘you read the sign, it mentions teams too! so listen, Harry_Potter … i am saying this for the last time … please, please don’t lose your temper with umbridge again or she might not let us play any more!’ ‘ok, ok,’ said Harry_Potter, for Angelina_Johnson looked as though she was on the verge of tears. ‘don’t worry, i’ll behave myself …’ ‘bet umbridge is in history of magic,’ said Ronald_Weasley grimly, as they set off for binns’s lesson. ‘she hasn’t inspected binns yet … bet you anything she’s there …’ but he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was professor binns, floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars. Harry_Potter did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione_Granger’s frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily. ‘what?’ she pointed at the window. Harry_Potter looked round. Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass at him, a letter tied to her leg. Harry_Potter could not understand it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadn’t she delivered the letter then, as usual? many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other, too. ‘oh, i’ve always loved that owl, she’s so beautiful,’ Harry_Potter heard Lavender_Brown sigh to Parvati_Patil. he glanced round at professor binns who continued to read his notes, serenely unaware that the class’s attention was even less focused upon him than usual. Harry_Potter slipped quietly off his chair, crouched down and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly. he had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the owlery, but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully. he closed the window with an anxious glance at professor binns, crouched low again and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his shoulder. he regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg. only then did he realise that Hedwig’s feathers were oddly ruffled; some were bent the wrong way, and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle. ‘she’s hurt!’ Harry_Potter whispered, bending his head low over her. Hermione_Granger and Ronald_Weasley leaned in closer; Hermione_Granger even put down her quill. ‘look – there’s something wrong with her wing –’ Hedwig was quivering; when Harry_Potter made to touch the wing she gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself, and gazed at him reproachfully. ‘professor binns,’ said Harry_Potter loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him. ‘i’m not feeling well.’ professor binns raised his eyes from his notes, looking amazed, as always, to find the room in front of him full of people. ‘not feeling well?’ he repeated hazily. ‘not at all well,’ said Harry_Potter firmly, getting to his feet with Hedwig concealed behind his back. ‘i think i need to go to the hospital wing.’ ‘yes,’ said professor binns, clearly very much wrong-footed. ‘yes … yes, hospital wing … well, off you go, then, Perkins …’ once outside the room, Harry_Potter returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of sight of binns’s door. his first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Rubeus_Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where Rubeus_Hagrid was his only remaining option was to find professor Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank and Hope_Howell she would help. he peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. there was no sign of her anywhere near Rubeus_Hagrid’s cabin; if she was not teaching, she was probably in the staff room. he set off downstairs, Hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder. two stone garGoyles flanked the staff-room door. as Harry_Potter approached, one of them croaked, ‘you should be in class, sonny jim.’ ‘this is urgent,’ said Harry_Potter curtly. ‘ooooh, urgent, is it?’ said the other garGoyle in a high-pitched voice. ‘well, that’s put us in our place, hasn’t it?’ Harry_Potter knocked. he heard footsteps, then the door opened and he found himself face to face with professor Minerva_McGonagall. ‘you haven’t been given another detention!’ she said at once, her square spectacles flashing alarmingly. ‘no, professor!’ said Harry_Potter hastily. ‘well then, why are you out of class?’ ‘it’s urgent, apparently,’ said the second garGoyle snidely. ‘i’m looking for professor Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank,’ Harry_Potter explained. ‘it’s my owl, she’s injured.’ ‘injured owl, did you say?’ professor Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank appeared at professor Minerva_McGonagall’s shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the daily prophet. ‘yes,’ said Harry_Potter, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, ‘she turned up after the other post owls and her wing’s all funny, look –’ professor Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry_Potter while professor Minerva_McGonagall watched. ‘hmm,’ said professor Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly as she talked. ‘looks like something’s attacked her. can’t think what would have done it, though. Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Rubeus_Hagrid’s got the hogwarts Thestrals well-trained not to touch owls.’ Harry_Potter neither knew nor cared what Thestrals were; he just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right. professor Minerva_McGonagall, however, looked sharply at Harry_Potter and said, ‘do you know how far this owl’s travelled, potter?’ ‘er,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘from london, i think.’ he met her eyes briefly and knew, by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle, that she understood ‘london’ to mean ‘number twelve, grimmauld place’. professor Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye to examine Hedwig’s wing closely. ‘i should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me, potter,’ she said, ‘she shouldn’t be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.’ ‘er – right – thanks,’ said Harry_Potter, just as the bell rang for break. ‘no problem,’ said professor Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back into the staff room. ‘just a moment, Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank!’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall. ‘potter’s letter!’ ‘oh yeah!’ said Harry_Potter, who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to Hedwig’s leg. professor Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared into the staff room carrying Hedwig, who was staring at Harry_Potter as though unable to believe he would give her away like this. feeling slightly guilty, he turned to go, but professor Minerva_McGonagall called him back. ‘potter!’ ‘yes, professor?’ she glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming from both directions. ‘bear in mind,’ she said quickly and quietly, her eyes on the scroll in his hand, ‘that channels of communication in and out of hogwarts may be being watched, won’t you?’ ‘i –’ said Harry_Potter, but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him. professor Minerva_McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staff room, leaving Harry_Potter to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd. he spotted Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger already standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up against the wind. Harry_Potter slit open the scroll as he hurried towards them and found five words in Sirius_Black’s handwriting: today, same time, same place. ‘is Hedwig ok?’ asked Hermione_Granger anxiously, the moment he was within earshot. ‘where did you take her?’ asked Ronald_Weasley ‘to Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘and i met Minerva_McGonagall … listen …’ and he told them what professor Minerva_McGonagall had said. to his surprise, neither of the others looked shocked. on the contrary, they exchanged significant looks. ‘what?’ said Harry_Potter, looking from Ronald_Weasley to Hermione_Granger and back again. ‘well, i was just saying to Ronald_Weasley … what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig? i mean, she’s never been hurt on a flight before, has she?’ ‘who’s the letter from, anyway?’ asked Ronald_Weasley taking the note from Harry_Potter. ‘Sirius_Black,’ said Harry_Potter quietly. ‘“same time, same place?” does he mean the fire in the common room?’ ‘obviously,’ said Hermione_Granger, also reading the note. she looked uneasy. ‘i just Hope_Howell nobody else has read this …’ ‘but it was still sealed and everything,’ said Harry_Potter, trying to convince himself as much as her. ‘and nobody would understand what it meant if they didn’t know where we’d spoken to him before, would they?’ ‘i don’t know,’ said Hermione_Granger anxiously, hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again, ‘it wouldn’t be exactly difficult to re-seal the scroll by magic … and if anyone’s watching the floo network … but i don’t really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted, too!’ they trudged down the stone steps to the Mundungus_Fletchereons for potions, all three of them lost in thought, but as they reached the bottom of the steps they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco_Malfoy, who was standing just outside snape’s classroom door, waving around an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word. ‘yeah, umbridge gave the slytherin quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway, i went to ask her first thing this morning. well, it was pretty much automatic, i mean, she knows my father really well, he’s always popping in and out of the ministry … it’ll be interesting to see whether gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won’t it?’ ‘don’t rise,’ Hermione_Granger whispered imploringly to Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley who were both watching malfoy, faces set and fists clenched. ‘it’s what he wants.’ ‘i mean,’ said malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his grey eyes glittering malevolently in Harry_Potter and ron’s direction, ‘if it’s a question of influence with the ministry, i don’t think they’ve got much chance … from what my father says, they’ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur_Weasley for years … and as for potter … my father says it’s a matter of time before the ministry has him carted off to st mungo’s … apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic.’ malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter; Pansy_Parkinson shrieked with glee. something collided hard with Harry_Potter’s shoulder, knocking him sideways. a split second later he realised that Neville_Longbottom had just charged past him, heading straight for malfoy. ‘Neville_Longbottom, no!’ Harry_Potter leapt forward and seized the back of Neville_Longbottom’s robes; Neville_Longbottom struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked. ‘help me!’ Harry_Potter flung at Ronald_Weasley managing to get an arm around Neville_Longbottom’s neck and dragging him backwards, away from the slytherins. Crabbe and Goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped in front of malfoy, ready for the fight. Ronald_Weasley seized Neville_Longbottom’s arms, and together he and Harry_Potter succeeded in dragging Neville_Longbottom back into the gryffindor line. Neville_Longbottom’s face was scarlet; the rendered him quite pressure Harry_Potter was exerting on his incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his mouth. ‘not … funny … don’t … mungo’s … show … him …’ the Mundungus_Fletchereon door opened. snape appeared there. his black eyes swept up the gryffindor line to the point where Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley were wrestling with Neville_Longbottom. throat  ‘fighting, potter, weasley, longbottom?’ snape said in his cold, sneering voice. ‘ten points from gryffindor. release longbottom, potter, or it will be detention. inside, all of you.’ Harry_Potter let go of Neville_Longbottom, who stood panting and glaring at him. ‘i had to stop you,’ Harry_Potter gasped, picking up his bag. ‘Crabbe and Goyle would’ve torn you apart.’ Neville_Longbottom said nothing; he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the Mundungus_Fletchereon. ‘what in the name of merlin,’ said Ronald_Weasley slowly, as they followed Neville_Longbottom, ‘was that about?’ Harry_Potter did not answer. he knew exactly why the subject of people who were in st mungo’s because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to Neville_Longbottom, but he had sworn to Albus_Dumbledore that he would not tell anyone Neville_Longbottom’s secret. even Neville_Longbottom did not know Harry_Potter knew. Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger took their usual seats at the back of the class, pulled out parchment, quills and their copies of one thousand magical herbs and fungi. the class around them was whispering about what Neville_Longbottom had just done, but when snape closed the Mundungus_Fletchereon door with an echoing bang, everybody immediately fell silent. ‘you will notice,’ said snape, in his low, sneering voice, ‘that we have a guest with us today.’ he gestured towards the dim corner of the Mundungus_Fletchereon and Harry_Potter saw professor umbridge sitting there, clipboard on her knee. he glanced sideways at Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger, his eyebrows raised. snape and umbridge, the two teachers he hated most. it was hard to decide which one he wanted to triumph over the other. ‘we are continuing with our strengthening solution today. you will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson; if correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend – instructions –’ he waved his wand again ‘– on the board. carry on.’ professor umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her corner. Harry_Potter was very interested in hearing her question snape; so interested, that he was becoming careless with his potion again. ‘salamander blood, Harry_Potter!’ Hermione_Granger moaned, grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time, ‘not pomegranate juice!’ ‘right,’ said Harry_Potter vaguely, putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner. umbridge had just got to her feet. ‘ha,’ he said softly, as she strode between two lines of desks towards snape, who was bending over Dean_Thomas’s cauldron. ‘well, the class seem fairly advanced for their level,’ she said briskly to snape’s back. ‘though i would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the strengthening solution. i think the ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus.’ snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her. ‘now … how long have you been teaching at hogwarts?’ she asked, her quill poised over her clipboard. ‘fourteen years,’ snape replied. his expression was unfathomable. his eyes on snape, Harry_Potter added a few drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange. ‘you applied first for the defence against the dark arts post, i believe?’ professor umbridge asked snape. ‘yes,’ said snape quietly. ‘but you were unsuccessful?’ snape’s lip curled. ‘obviously.’ professor umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. ‘and you have applied regularly for the defence against the dark arts post since you first joined the school, i believe?’ ‘yes,’ said snape quietly, barely moving his lips. he looked very angry. ‘do you have any idea why Albus_Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you?’ asked umbridge. ‘i suggest you ask him,’ said snape jerkily. ‘oh, i shall,’ said professor umbridge, with a sweet smile. ‘i suppose this is relevant?’ snape asked, his black eyes narrowed. ‘oh yes,’ said professor umbridge, ‘yes, the ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers’ – er – backgrounds.’ she turned away, walked over to Pansy_Parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons. snape looked round at Harry_Potter and their eyes met for a second. Harry_Potter hastily dropped his gaze to his potion, which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber. ‘no marks again, then, potter,’ said snape maliciously, emptying Harry_Potter’s cauldron with a wave of his wand. ‘you will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?’ ‘yes,’ said Harry_Potter furiously. snape had already given them homework and he had quidditch practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights. it did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy. all he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end. ‘maybe i’ll skive off divination,’ he said glumly, as they stood in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats. ‘i’ll pretend to be ill and do snape’s essay instead, then i won’t have to stay up half the night.’ ‘you can’t skive off divination,’ said Hermione_Granger severely. ‘hark who’s talking, you walked out of divination, you hate Sybill_Trelawney!’ said Ronald_Weasley indignantly. ‘i don’t hate her,’ said Hermione_Granger loftily. ‘i just think she’s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. but Harry_Potter’s already missed history of magic and i don’t think he ought to miss anything else today!’ there was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry_Potter took his seat in the hot, overperfumed atmosphere of the divination classroom, feeling angry at everybody. professor Sybill_Trelawney was yet again handing out copies of the dream oracle. Harry_Potter thought he’d surely be much better employed doing snape’s punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of made-up dreams. it seemed, however, that he was not the only person in divination who was in a temper. professor Sybill_Trelawney slammed a copy of the oracle down on the table between Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley and swept away, her lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the oracle at Seamus_Finnigan and Dean_Thomas, narrowly avoiding Seamus_Finnigan’s head, and thrust the final one into Neville_Longbottom’s chest with such force that he slipped off his pouffe. ‘well, carry on!’ said professor Sybill_Trelawney loudly, her voice high-pitched and somewhat hystEric_Munchal, ‘you know what to do! or am i such a sub-standard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?’ the class stared perplexedly at her, then at each other. Harry_Potter, however, thought he knew what was the matter. as professor Sybill_Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teacher’s chair, her magnified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to ron’s and muttered, ‘i think she’s got the results of her inspection back.’ ‘professor?’ said Parvati_Patil in a hushed voice (she and Lavender_Brown had always rather admired professor Sybill_Trelawney). ‘professor, is there anything – er – wrong?’ ‘wrong!’ cried professor Sybill_Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion. ‘certainly not! i have been insulted, certainly … insinuations have been made against me … unfounded accusations levelled … but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not!’ she took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati_Patil, angry tears spilling from under her glasses. ‘i say nothing,’ she choked, ‘of sixteen years of devoted service … it has passed, apparently, unnoticed … but i shall not be insulted, no, i shall not!’ ‘but, professor, who’s insulting you?’ asked Parvati_Patil timidly. ‘the establishment!’ said professor Sybill_Trelawney, in a deep, dramatic, wavering voice. ‘yes, those with eyes too clouded by the mundane to see as i see, to know as i know … of course, we seers have always been feared, always persecuted … it is – alas – our fate.’ she gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl, then she pulled a small embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve, and blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blowing a raspberry. Ronald_Weasley sniggered. Lavender_Brown shot him a disgusted look. ‘professor,’ said Parvati_Patil, ‘do you mean … is it something professor umbridge –?’ ‘do not speak to me about that woman!’ cried professor Sybill_Trelawney, leaping to her feet, her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing. ‘kindly continue with your work!’ and she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still leaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats under her breath. ‘… may well choose to leave … the indignity of it … on probation … we shall see … how she dares …’ ‘you and umbridge have got something in common,’ Harry_Potter told Hermione_Granger quietly when they met again in defence against the dark arts. ‘she obviously reckons Sybill_Trelawney’s an old fraud, too … looks like she’s put her on probation.’ umbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness. ‘good afternoon, class.’ ‘good afternoon, professor umbridge,’ they chanted drearily. ‘wands away, please.’ but there was no answering flurry of movement this time; nobody had bothered to take out their wands. ‘please turn to page thirty-four of defensive magical theory and read the third chapter, entitled “the case for non-offensive responses to magical attack”. there will be –’ ‘– no need to talk,’ Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger said together, under their breaths. * ‘no quidditch practice,’ said Angelina_Johnson in hollow tones when Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger entered the common room after dinner that night. ‘but i kept my temper!’ said Harry_Potter, horrified. ‘i didn’t say anything to her, Angelina_Johnson, i swear, i –’ ‘i know, i know,’ said Angelina_Johnson miserably. ‘she just said she needed a bit of time to consider.’ ‘consider what?’ said Ronald_Weasley angrily. ‘she’s given the slytherins permission, why not us?’ but Harry_Potter could imagine how much umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no gryffindor quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon. ‘well,’ said Hermione_Granger, ‘look on the bright side – at least now you’ll have time to do snape’s essay!’ ‘that’s a bright side, is it?’ snapped Harry_Potter, while Ronald_Weasley stared incredulously at Hermione_Granger. ‘no quidditch practice, and extra potions?’ Harry_Potter slumped down into a chair, dragged his potions essay reluctantly from his bag and set to work. it was very hard to concentrate; even though he knew Sirius_Black was not due in the fire until much later, he could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case. there was also an incredible amount of noise in the room: Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley appeared finally to have perfected one type of skiving snackbox, which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd. first, Fred_Weasley would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them. then he would force down the purple end of the chew, at which the vomiting would immediately cease. Lee_Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same vanishing spell snape kept using on Harry_Potter’s potions. what with the regular sounds of retching, cheering and the sound of Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley taking advance orders from the crowd, Harry_Potter was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for strengthening solution. Hermione_Granger was not helping matters; the cheers and the sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley’s bucket were punctuated by her loud and disapproving sniffs, which Harry_Potter found, if anything, more distracting. ‘just go and stop them, then!’ he said irRita_Skeeterbly, after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time. ‘i can’t, they’re not technically doing anything wrong,’ said Hermione_Granger through gritted teeth. ‘they’re quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and i can’t find a rule that says the other idiots aren’t entitled to buy them, not unless they’re proven to be dangerous in some way and it doesn’t look as though they are.’ she, Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley watched George_Weasley projectile-vomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause. ‘you know, i don’t get why Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley only got three o.w.l.s each,’ said Harry_Potter, watching as Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley and Lee_Jordan collected gold from the eager crowd. ‘they really know their stuff.’ ‘oh, they only know flashy stuff that’s of no real use to anyone,’ said Hermione_Granger disparagingly. ‘no real use?’ said Ronald_Weasley in a strained voice. ‘Hermione_Granger, they’ve made about twenty-six galleons already.’ it was a long while before the crowd around the weasley twins dispersed, then Fred_Weasley, Lee_Jordan and George_Weasley sat up counting their takings even longer, so it was well past midnight when Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger finally had the common room to themselves. at long last, Fred_Weasley had closed the doorway to the boys’ dormitories behind him, rattling his box of galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione_Granger scowled. Harry_Potter, who was making very little progress with his potions essay, decided to give it up for the night. as he put his books away, Ronald_Weasley who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, and looked blearily into the fire. ‘Sirius_Black!’ he said. Harry_Potter whipped round. Sirius_Black’s untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again. ‘hi,’ he said, grinning. ‘hi,’ chorused Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger, all three kneeling down on the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to Sirius_Black’s. ‘how’re things?’ said Sirius_Black. ‘not that good,’ said Harry_Potter, as Hermione_Granger pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers. ‘the ministry’s forced through another decree, which means we’re not allowed to have quidditch teams –’ ‘or secret defence against the dark arts groups?’ said Sirius_Black. there was a short pause. ‘how did you know about that?’ Harry_Potter demanded. ‘you want to choose your meeting places more carefully,’ said Sirius_Black, grinning still more broadly. ‘the hog’s head, i ask you.’ ‘well, it was better than the three broomsticks!’ said Hermione_Granger defensively. ‘that’s always packed with people –’ ‘which means you’d have been harder to overhear,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘you’ve got a lot to learn, Hermione_Granger.’ ‘who overheard us?’ Harry_Potter demanded. ‘MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, of course,’ said Sirius_Black, and when they all looked puzzled he laughed. ‘he was the witch under the veil.’ ‘that was MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher?’ Harry_Potter said, stunned. ‘what was he doing in the hog’s head?’ ‘what do you think he was doing?’ said Sirius_Black impatiently. ‘keeping an eye on you, of course.’ ‘i’m still being followed?’ asked Harry_Potter angrily. ‘yeah, you are,’ said Sirius_Black, ‘and just as well, isn’t it, if the first thing you’re going to do on your weekend off is organise an illegal defence group.’ but he looked neither angry nor worried. on the contrary, he was looking at Harry_Potter with distinct pride. ‘why was Mundungus_Fletcher hiding from us?’ asked Ronald_Weasley sounding disappointed. ‘we’d’ve liked to’ve seen him.’ ‘he was banned from the hog’s head twenty years ago,’ said Sirius_Black, ‘and that barman’s got a long memory. we lost moody’s spare invisibility cloak when Sturgis_Podmore was arrested, so Mundungus_Fletcher’s been dressing as a witch a lot lately … anyway … first of all, Ronald_Weasley – i’ve sworn to pass on a message from your mother.’ ‘oh yeah?’ said Ronald_Weasley sounding apprehensive. ‘she says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret defence against the dark arts group. she says you’ll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined. she says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now. she also’ (Sirius_Black’s eyes turned to the other two) ‘advises Harry_Potter and Hermione_Granger not to proceed with the group, though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart. she would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted you’d all have been in real trouble, and she can’t say it for herself because she’s on duty tonight.’ ‘on duty doing what?’ said Ronald_Weasley quickly. ‘never you mind, just stuff for the order,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘so it’s fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her i passed it all on, because i don’t think she trusts me to.’ there was another pause in which Crookshanks, mewing, attempted to paw Sirius_Black’s head, and Ronald_Weasley fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug. ‘so, you want me to say i’m not going to take part in the defence group?’ he muttered finally. ‘me? certainly not!’ said Sirius_Black, looking surprised. ‘i think it’s an excellent idea!’ ‘you do?’ said Harry_Potter, his heart lifting. ‘of course i do!’ said Sirius_Black. ‘d’you think your father and i would’ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like umbridge?’ ‘but – last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks –’ ‘last year, all the evidence was that someone inside hogwarts was trying to kill you, Harry_Potter!’ said Sirius_Black impatiently. ‘this year, we know there’s someone outside hogwarts who’d like to kill us all, so i think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!’ ‘and if we do get expelled?’ Hermione_Granger asked, a quizzical look on her face. ‘Hermione_Granger, this whole thing was your idea!’ said Harry_Potter, staring at her. ‘i know it was. i just wondered what Sirius_Black thought,’ she said, shrugging. ‘well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘hear, hear,’ said Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley enthusiastically. ‘so,’ said Sirius_Black, ‘how are you organising this group? where are you meeting?’ ‘well, that’s a bit of a problem now,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘dunno where we’re going to be able to go.’ ‘how about the shrieking shack?’ suggested Sirius_Black. ‘hey, that’s an idea!’ said Ronald_Weasley excitedly, but Hermione_Granger made a sceptical noise and all three of them looked at her, Sirius_Black’s head turning in the flames. ‘well, Sirius_Black, it’s just that there were only four of you meeting in the shrieking shack when you were at school,’ said Hermione_Granger, ‘and all of you could transform into animals and i suppose you could all have squeezed under a single invisibility cloak if you’d wanted to. but there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an animagus, so we wouldn’t need so much an invisibility cloak as an invisibility marquee –’ ‘fair point,’ said Sirius_Black, looking slightly crestfallen. ‘well, i’m sure you’ll come up with somewhere. there used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you might have enough space to practise jinxes in there.’ ‘Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley told me it’s blocked,’ said Harry_Potter, shaking his head. ‘caved in or something.’ ‘oh …’ said Sirius_Black, frowning. ‘well, i’ll have a think and get back to –’ he broke off. his face was suddenly tense, alarmed. he turned sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace. ‘Sirius_Black?’ said Harry_Potter anxiously. but he had vanished. Harry_Potter gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger. ‘why did he –?’ Hermione_Granger gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire. a hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings. the three of them ran for it. at the door of the boys’ dormitory Harry_Potter looked back. umbridge’s hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius_Black’s hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.
