— chapter twenty-eight — snape’s worst memory by order of the ministry of Magic_goblin Dolores_Umbridge jane umbridge (high inquisitor) has replaced Albus_Dumbledore Albus_Dumbledore as head of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. the above is in accordance with educational decree number twenty-eight. signed: Cornelius_Fudge oswald fudge, minister for Magic_goblin the notices had gone up all around the school overnight, but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that Albus_Dumbledore had overcome two aurors, the high inquisitor, the minister for Magic_goblin and his junior assiStanley_Shunpiket to escape. no matter where Harry_Potter went within the castle, the sole topic of conversation was Albus_Dumbledore’s flight, and though some of the details may have gone awry in the retelling (Harry_Potter overheard one second-year girl assuring another that fudge was now lying in st mungo’s with a pumpkin for a head) it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was. everybody knew, for inStanley_Shunpikece, that Harry_Potter and Marietta_Edgecombe were the only students to have witnessed the scene in Albus_Dumbledore’s office and, as Marietta_Edgecombe was now in the hospital wing, Harry_Potter found himself besieged with requests to give a firsthand account. ‘Albus_Dumbledore will be back before long,’ said Ernest_Prangmacmillan confidently on the way back from herbology, after listening intently to Harry_Potter’s story. ‘they couldn’t keep him away in our second year and they won’t be able to this time. the Fat_Friar told me –’ he dropped his voice conspiratorially, so that Harry_Potter,Ronald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger had to lean closer to him to hear ‘– that umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they’d searched the castle and grounds for him. couldn’t get past the garGoyle. the head’s office           has sealed itself against her.’ Ernest_Prangsmirked. ‘apparently, she had a right little tantrum.’ ‘oh, i expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the head’s office,’ said Hermione_Granger viciously, as they walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall. ‘lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid puffed-up, power-crazy old –’ ‘now, do you really want to finish that sentence, granger?’ Draco_Malfoy malfoy had slid out from behind the door, followed by crabbe and Goyle. his pale, pointed face was alight with mAlice_Longbottom. ‘afraid i’m going to have to dock a few points from gryffindor and hufflepuff,’ he drawled. ‘you can’t take points from fellow prefects, malfoy,’ said Ernest_Prangat once. ‘i know prefects can’t dock points from each other,’ sneered malfoy. crabbe and Goyle sniggered. ‘but members of the inquisitorial squad –’ ‘the what?’ said Hermione_Granger sharply. ‘the inquisitorial squad, granger,’ said malfoy, pointing towards a tiny silver ‘i’ on his robes just beneath his prefect’s badge. ‘a select group of students who are supportive of the ministry of Magic_goblin, hand-picked by professor umbridge. anyway, members of the inquisitorial squad do have the power to dock points … so, granger, i’ll have five from you for being rude about our new headmistress. macmillan, five for contradicting me. five because i don’t like you, potter. weasley, your shirt’s untucked, so i’ll have another five for that. oh yeah, i forgot, you’re a mudblood, granger, so ten off for that.’Ronald_Weasleypulled out his wand, but Hermione_Granger pushed it away, whispering, ‘don’t!’ ‘wise move, granger,’ breathed malfoy. ‘new head, new times … be good now, potty … weasel king …’ laughing heartily, he strode away with crabbe and Goyle. ‘he was bluffing,’ said Ernest_Macmillan, looking appalled. ‘he can’t be allowed to dock points … that would be ridiculous … it would completely undermine the prefect system.’ but Harry_Potter,Ronald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger had turned automatically towards the giant hour-glasses set in niches along the wall behind them, which recorded the house-points. gryffindor and ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning. even as they watched, stones flew upwards, reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs. in fact, the only glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald-filled one of slytherin. ‘noticed, have you?’ said Fred_Weasley’s voice. he and George_Weasley had just come down the marble staircase and joined Harry_Potter, ron, Hermione_Granger and Ernest_Prangin front of the hourglasses. ‘malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,’ said Harry_Potter furiously, as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the gryffindor hour-glass. ‘yeah, montague tried to do us during break,’ said George_Weasley. ‘what do you mean, “tried”?’ saidRonald_Weasleyquickly. ‘he never managed to get all the words out,’ said Fred_Weasley, ‘due to the fact that we forced him head-first into that vanishing cabinet on the first floor.’ Hermione_Granger looked very shocked. ‘but you’ll get into terrible trouble!’ ‘not until montague reappears, and that could take weeks, i dunno where we sent him,’ said Fred_Weasley coolly. ‘anyway … we’ve decided we don’t care about getting into trouble any more.’ ‘have you ever?’ asked Hermione_Granger. ‘course we have,’ said George_Weasley. ‘never been expelled, have we?’ ‘we’ve always known where to draw the line,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘we might have put a toe across it occasionally,’ said George_Weasley. ‘but we’ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘but now?’ saidRonald_Weasleytentatively. ‘well, now –’ said George_Weasley. ‘– what with Albus_Dumbledore gone –’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘– we reckon a bit of mayhem –’ said George_Weasley. ‘– is exactly what our dear new head deserves,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘you mustn’t!’ whispered Hermione_Granger. ‘you really mustn’t! she’d love a reason to expel you!’ ‘you don’t get it, Hermione_Granger, do you?’ said Fred_Weasley, smiling at her. ‘we don’t care about staying any more. we’d walk out right now if we weren’t determined to do our bit for Albus_Dumbledore first. so, anyway,’ he checked his watch, ‘phase one is about to begin. i’d get in the great hall for lunch, if i were you, that way the teachers will see you can’t have had anything to do with it.’ ‘anything to do with what?’ said Hermione_Granger anxiously. ‘you’ll see,’ said George_Weasley. ‘run along, now.’ Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley turned away and disappeared into the swelling crowd descending the stairs towards lunch. looking highly disconcerted, Ernest_Prangmuttered something about unfinished transfiguration homework and scurried away. ‘i think we should get out of here, you know,’ said Hermione_Granger nervously. ‘just in case …’ ‘yeah, all right,’ said ron, and the three of them moved towards the doors to the great hall, but Harry_Potter had barely glimpsed the day’s ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and, turning, he found himself almost nose-to-nose with filch the caretaker. he took several hasty steps backwards; filch was best viewed at a diStanley_Shunpikece. ‘the headmistress would like to see you, potter,’ he leered. ‘i didn’t do it,’ said Harry_Potter stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley were planning. filch’s jowls wobbled with silent laughter. ‘guilty conscience, eh?’ he wheezed. ‘follow me.’ Harry_Potter glanced back atRonald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger, who were both looking worried. he shrugged, and followed filch back into the entrance hall, against the tide of hungry students. filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood; he hummed creakily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase. as they reached the first landing he said, ‘things are changing around here, potter.’ ‘i’ve noticed,’ said Harry_Potter coldly. ‘yerse … i’ve been telling Albus_Dumbledore for years and years he’s too soft with you all,’ said filch, chuckling nastily. ‘you filthy little beasts would never have dropped stink pellets if you’d known i had it in my power to whip you raw, would you, now? nobody would have thought of throwing Fanged frisbees down the corridors if i could’ve strung you up by the ankles in my office, would they? but when educational decree number twenty-nine comes in, potter, i’ll be allowed to do them things … and she’s asked the minister to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves … oh, things are going to be very different around here with her in charge …’ umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get filch on her side, Harry_Potter thought, and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon; his knowledge of the school’s secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to that of the weasley twins. ‘here we are,’ he said, leering down at Harry_Potter as he rapped three times on professor umbridge’s door and pushed it open. ‘the potter boy to see you, ma’am.’ umbridge’s office, so very familiar to Harry_Potter from his many detentions, was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word: headmistress. also, his firebolt and Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley’s cleansweeps, which he saw with a pang, were chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk. umbridge was sitting behind the desk, busily scribbling on some of her pink parchment, but she looked up and smiled widely at their entrance. ‘thank you, Argus_Filch,’ she said sweetly. ‘not at all, ma’am, not at all,’ said filch, bowing as low as his rheumatism would permit, and exiting backwards. ‘sit,’ said umbridge curtly, pointing towards a chair. Harry_Potter sat. she continued to scribble for a few moments. he watched some of the foul kittens gambolling around the plates over her head, wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him. ‘well, now,’ she said finally, setting down her quill and looking like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly. ‘what would you like to drink?’ ‘what?’ said Harry_Potter, quite sure he had misheard her. ‘to drink, mr potter,’ she said, smiling still more widely. ‘tea? coffee? pumpkin juice?’ as she named each drink, she gave her short wand a wave, and a cup or glass of it appeared on her desk. ‘nothing, thank you,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘i wish you to have a drink with me,’ she said, her voice becoming dangerously sweet. ‘choose one.’ ‘fine … tea then,’ said Harry_Potter, shrugging. she got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him. she then bustled around the desk with it, smiling in a sinisterly sweet fashion. ‘there,’ she said, handing it to him. ‘drink it before it gets cold, won’t you? well, now, mr potter … i thought we ought to have a little chat, after the distressing events of last night.’ he said nothing. she settled herself back into her seat and waited. when several long moments had passed in silence, she said gaily, ‘you’re not drinking up!’ he raised the cup to his lips and then, just as suddenly, lowered it. one of the horrible painted kittens behind umbridge had great round blue eyes just like Alastor_Moody moody’s Magic_goblinal one and it had just occurred to Harry_Potter what Alastor_Moody would say if he ever heard that Harry_Potter had drunk anything offered by a known enemy. ‘what’s the matter?’ said umbridge, who was still watching him. ‘do you want sugar?’ ‘no,’ said Harry_Potter. he raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip, though keeping his mouth tightly closed. umbridge’s smile widened. ‘good,’ she whispered. ‘very good. now then …’ she leaned forwards a little. ‘where is Albus_Dumbledore Albus_Dumbledore?’ ‘no idea,’ said Harry_Potter promptly. ‘drink up, drink up,’ she said, still smiling. ‘now, mr potter, let us not play childish games. i know that you know where he has gone. you and Albus_Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning. consider your position, mr potter …’ ‘i don’t know where he is.’ Harry_Potter pretended to drink again. ‘very well,’ said umbridge, looking displeased. ‘in that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius_Black black.’ Harry_Potter’s stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that it rattled in its saucer. he tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid trickled down on to his robes. ‘i don’t know,’ he said, a little too quickly. ‘mr potter,’ said umbridge, ‘let me remind you that it was i who almost caught the criminal black in the gryffindor fire in october. i know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if i had had any proof neither of you would be at large today, i promise you. i repeat, mr potter … where is Sirius_Black black?’ ‘no idea,’ said Harry_Potter loudly. ‘haven’t got a clue.’ they stared at each other so long that Harry_Potter felt his eyes watering. then umbridge stood up. ‘very well, potter, i will take your word for it this time, but be warned: the might of the ministry Stanley_Shunpikeds behind me. all channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored. a floo network regulator is keeping watch over every fire in hogwarts – except my own, of course. my inquisitorial squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle. and mr filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle. if i find a shred of evidence …’ boom! the very floor of the office shook. umbridge slipped sideways, clutching her desk for support, and looking shocked. ‘what was –?’ she was gazing towards the door. Harry_Potter took the opportunity to empty his almost-full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers. he could hear people running and screaming several floors below. ‘back to lunch you go, potter!’ cried umbridge, raising her wand and dashing out of the office. Harry_Potter gave her a few seconds’ start, then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was. it was not difficult to find. one floor down, pandemonium reigned. somebody (and Harry_Potter had a very shrewd idea who) had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks. dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went; shocking-pink catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers; rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls; sparklers were writing swear words in midair of their own accord; firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry_Potter looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched. filch and umbridge were Stanley_Shunpikeding, apparently transfixed in horror, halfway down the stairs. as Harry_Potter watched, one of the larger catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to manoeuvre; it whirled towards umbridge and filch with a sinister ‘wheeeeeeeeee’. they both yelled with fright and ducked, and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds. meanwhile, several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape towards the second floor. ‘hurry, filch, hurry!’ shrieked umbridge, ‘they’ll be all over the school unless we do something – stupefy!’ a jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets. instead of freezing in midair, it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy-looking witch in the middle of a meadow; she ran for it just in time, reappearing seconds later squashed into the next painting, where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her. ‘don’t stun them, filch!’ shouted umbridge angrily, for all the world as though it had been his incantation. ‘right you are, headmistress!’ wheezed filch, who as a squib could no more have stunned the fireworks than swallowed them. he dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom and began swatting at the fireworks in midair; within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze. Harry_Potter had seen enough; laughing, he ducked down low, ran to a door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley hiding just behind it, listening to umbridge and filch’s yells and quaking with suppressed mirth. ‘impressive,’ Harry_Potter said quietly, grinning. ‘very impressive … you’ll put dr filibuster out of business, no problem …’ ‘cheers,’ whispered George_Weasley, wiping tears of laughter from his face. ‘oh, i Hope_Howell she tries vanishing them next … they multiply by ten every time you try.’ the fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon. though they caused plenty of disruption, particularly the firecrackers, the other teachers didn’t seem to mind them very much. ‘dear, dear,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall sardonically, as one of the dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame. ‘miss brown, would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom?’ the upshot of it all was that professor umbridge spent her first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her. when the final bell rang and they were heading back to gryffindor tower with their bags, Harry_Potter saw, with immense satisfaction, a dishevelled and soot-blackened umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from professor flitwick’s classroom. ‘thank you so much, professor!’ said professor flitwick in his squeaky little voice. ‘i could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of course, but i wasn’t sure whether or not i had the authority.’ beaming, he closed his classroom door in her snarling face. Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley were heroes that night in the gryffindor common room. even Hermione_Granger fought her way through the excited crowd to congratulate them. ‘they were wonderful fireworks,’ she said admiringly. ‘thanks,’ said George_Weasley, looking both surprised and pleased. ‘weasleys’ wildfire whiz-bangs. only thing is, we used our whole stock; we’re going to have to start again from scratch now.’ ‘it was worth it, though,’ said Fred_Weasley, who was taking orders from clamouring gryffindors. ‘if you want to add your name to the waiting list, Hermione_Granger, it’s five galleons for your basic blaze box and twenty for the deflagration deluxe …’ Hermione_Granger returned to the table where Harry_Potter andRonald_Weasleywere sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework would spring out and start doing itself. ‘oh, why don’t we have a night off?’ said Hermione_Granger brightly, as a silver- tailed weasley rocket zoomed past the window. ‘after all, the easter holidays start on friday, we’ll have plenty of time then.’ ‘are you feeling all right?’Ronald_Weasleyasked, staring at her in disbelief. ‘now you mention it,’ said Hermione_Granger happily, ‘d’you know … i think i’m feeling a bit … rebellious.’ Harry_Potter could still hear the diStanley_Shunpiket bangs of escaped firecrackers when he andRonald_Weasleywent up to bed an hour later; and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word ‘poo’. he got into bed, yawning. with his glasses off, the occasional firework passing the window had become blurred, looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky. he turned on to his side, wondering how umbridge was feeling about her first day in Albus_Dumbledore’s job, and how fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption. smiling to himself, Harry_Potter closed his eyes … the whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more diStanley_Shunpiket … or perhaps he was simply speeding away from them … he had fallen right into the corridor leading to the department of mysteries. he was speeding towards the plain black door … let it open … let it open … it did. he was inside the circular room lined with doors … he crossed it, placed his hand on an identical door and it swung inwards … now he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking. there were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate … he had to go on … there was a door at the far end … it, too, opened at his touch … and now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church, full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden with small, dusty, spun-glass spheres … now Harry_Potter’s heart was beating fast with excitement … he knew where to go … he ran forwards, but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted room … there was something in this room he wanted very, very much … something he wanted … or somebody else wanted … his scar was hurting … bang! Harry_Potter awoke inStanley_Shunpiketly, confused and angry. the dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter. ‘cool!’ said Seamus_Finnigan, who was silhouetted against the window. ‘i think one of those catherine wheels hit a rocket and it’s like they mated, come and see!’ Harry_Potter heardRonald_Weasleyand Dean_Thomas scramble out of bed for a better look. he lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him. he felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment … he had got so close that time. glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of gryffindor tower. Harry_Potter lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of gryffindors in the dormitories below them. his stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had occlumency the following evening. * Harry_Potter spent the whole of the next day dreading what snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the department of mysteries Harry_Potter had penetrated during his last dream. with a surge of guilt he realised that he had not practised occlumency once since their last lesson: there had been too much going on since Albus_Dumbledore had left; he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried. he doubted, however, whether snape would accept that excuse. he attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good. Hermione_Granger kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing revision questions at the class. resigned to the worst, he set off for snape’s office after dinner. halfway across the entrance hall, however,Cho_Changcame hurrying up to him. ‘over here,’ said Harry_Potter, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with snape, and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall where the giant hour-glasses stood. gryffindor’s was now almost empty. ‘are you ok? umbridge hasn’t been asking you about the da, has she?’ ‘oh, no,’ saidCho_Changhurriedly. ‘no, it was only … well, i just wanted to say … Harry_Potter, i never dreamed Marietta_Edgecombe would tell …’ ‘yeah, well,’ said Harry_Potter moodily. he did feelCho_Changmight have chosen her friends a bit more carefully; it was small consolation that the last he had heard, Marietta_Edgecombe was still up in the hospital wing and madam pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples. ‘she’s a lovely person really,’ said cho. ‘she just made a mistake –’ Harry_Potter looked at her incredulously. ‘a lovely person who made a mistake? she sold us all out, including you!’ ‘well … we all got away, didn’t we?’ saidCho_Changpleadingly. ‘you know, her mum works for the ministry, it’s really difficult for her –’ ‘ron’s dad works for the ministry too!’ Harry_Potter said furiously. ‘and in case you hadn’t noticed, he hasn’t got sneak written across his face –’ ‘that was a really horrible trick of Hermione_Granger’s,’ saidCho_Changfiercely. ‘she should have told us she’d jinxed that list –’ ‘i think it was a brilliant idea,’ said Harry_Potter coldly.Cho_Changflushed and her eyes grew brighter. ‘oh yes, i forgot – of course, if it was darling Hermione_Granger’s idea –’ ‘don’t start crying again,’ said Harry_Potter warningly. ‘i wasn’t going to!’ she shouted. ‘yeah … well … good,’ he said. ‘i’ve got enough to cope with at the moment.’ ‘go and cope with it then!’Cho_Changsaid furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off. fuming, Harry_Potter descended the stairs to snape’s Mundungus_Fletchereon and, though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he should have said toCho_Changabout Marietta_Edgecombe before reaching the Mundungus_Fletchereon door. ‘you’re late, potter,’ said snape coldly, as Harry_Potter closed the door behind him. snape was Stanley_Shunpikeding with his back to Harry_Potter, removing, as usual, certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Albus_Dumbledore’s pensieve. he dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face Harry_Potter. ‘so,’ he said. ‘have you been practising?’ ‘yes,’ Harry_Potter lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of snape’s desk. ‘well, we’ll soon find out, won’t we?’ said snape smoothly. ‘wand out, potter.’ Harry_Potter moved into his usual position, facing snape with the desk between them. his heart was pumping fast with anger atCho_Changand anxiety about how much snape was about to extract from his mind. ‘on the count of three then,’ said snape lazily. ‘one – two –’ snape’s office door banged open and Draco_Malfoy malfoy sped in. ‘professor snape, sir – oh – sorry –’ malfoy was looking at snape and Harry_Potter in some surprise. ‘it’s all right, Draco_Malfoy,’ said snape, lowering his wand. ‘potter is here for a little remedial potions.’ Harry_Potter had not seen malfoy look so gleeful since umbridge had turned up to inspect Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘i didn’t know,’ he said, leering at Harry_Potter, who knew his face was burning. he would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at malfoy – or, even better, to hit him with a good curse. ‘well, Draco_Malfoy, what is it?’ asked snape. ‘it’s professor umbridge, sir – she needs your help,’ said malfoy. ‘they’ve found montague, sir, he’s turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor.’ ‘how did he get in there?’ demanded snape. ‘i don’t know, sir, he’s a bit confused.’ ‘very well, very well. potter,’ said snape, ‘we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening.’ he turned and swept from his office. malfoy mouthed, ‘remedial potions?’ at Harry_Potter behind snape’s back before following him. seething, Harry_Potter replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room. at least he had twenty-four more hours in which to practise; he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape, though it was hard that it came at the expense of malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial potions. he was at the office door when he saw it: a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe. he stopped, and stood looking at it, reminded of something … then he remembered: it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night, the lights in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the department of mysteries. he turned around. the light was coming from the pensieve sitting on snape’s desk. the silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling within. snape’s thoughts … things he did not want Harry_Potter to see if he broke through snape’s defences accidenTall_gobliny … Harry_Potter gazed at the pensieve, curiosity welling inside him … what was it that snape was so keen to hide from Harry_Potter? the silvery lights shivered on the wall … Harry_Potter took two steps towards the desk, thinking hard. could it possibly be information about the department of mysteries that snape was determined to keep from him? Harry_Potter looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever. how long would it take snape to release montague from the toilet? would he come straight back to his office afterwards, or accompany montague to the hospital wing? surely the latter … montague was captain of the slytherin quidditch team, snape would want to make sure he was all right. Harry_Potter walked the remaining few feet to the pensieve and stood over it, gazing into its depths. he hesitated, listening, then pulled out his wand again. the office and the corridor beyond were completely silent. he gave the contents of the pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand. the silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry_Potter leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent. he was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling … in fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was looking down into the great hall. his breath was actually fogging the surface of snape’s thoughts … his brain seemed to be in limbo … it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do … he was trembling … snape could be back at any moment … but Harry_Potter thought of cho’s anger, of malfoy’s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him. he took a great gulp of breath, and plunged his face into the surface of snape’s thoughts. at once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping Harry_Potter head- first into the pensieve … he was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he went, and then – he was Stanley_Shunpikeding in the middle of the great hall, but the four house tables were gone. instead, there were more than a hundred smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student, head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. the only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment. it was clearly exam time. sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light. Harry_Potter looked around carefully. snape had to be here somewhere … this was his memory … and there he was, at a table right behind Harry_Potter. Harry_Potter stared. snape-the- teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant kept in the dark. his hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled. Harry_Potter moved around behind snape and read the heading of the examination paper: defence against the dark arts – ordinary wizarding level. so snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry_Potter’s own age. his hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbours, and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped. ‘five more minutes!’ the voice made Harry_Potter jump. turning, he saw the top of professor flitwick’s head moving between the desks a short diStanley_Shunpikece away. professor flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair … very untidy black hair … Harry_Potter moved so quickly that, had he been solid, he would have knocked desks flying. instead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across two aisles and up a third. the back of the black-haired boy’s head drew nearer and … he was straightening up now, putting down his quill, pulling his roll of parchment towards him so as to reread what he had written … Harry_Potter stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-year-old father. excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James_Potter_I’s eyes were hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry_Potter’s and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows; James_Potter_I’s hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry_Potter’s did, his hands could have been Harry_Potter’s and Harry_Potter could tell that, when James_Potter_I stood up, they would be within an inch of each other in height. James_Potter_I yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even messier than it had been. then, with a glance towards professor flitwick, he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him. with another shock of excitement, Harry_Potter saw Sirius_Black give James_Potter_I the thumbs-up. Sirius_Black was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back on two legs. he was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James_Potter_I’s nor Harry_Potter’s could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him Hope_Howellfully, though he didn’t seem to have noticed. and two seats along from this girl – Harry_Potter’s stomach gave another pleasurable squirm – was Remus_Lupin lupin. he looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon approaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: as he reread his answers, he scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly. so that meant Peter_Pettigrew had to be around here somewhere, too … and sure enough, Harry_Potter spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-haired boy with a pointed nose. Peter_Pettigrew looked anxious; he was chewing his fingernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground with his toes. every now and then he glanced Hope_Howellfully at his neighbour’s paper. Harry_Potter stared at Peter_Pettigrew for a moment, then back at James_Potter_I, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. he had drawn a snitch and was now tracing the letters ‘l.e.’. what did they Stanley_Shunpiked for? ‘quills down, please!’ squeaked professor flitwick. ‘that means you too, Stebbins_(1990s_Hogwarts_student)! please remain seated while i collect your parchment! accio!’ over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into professor flitwick’s outstretched arms, knocking him backwards off his feet. several people laughed. a couple of students at the front desks got up, took hold of professor flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him back on to his feet. ‘thank you … thank you,’ panted professor flitwick. ‘very well, everybody, you’re free to go!’ Harry_Potter looked down at his father, who had hastily crossed out the ‘l.e.’ he had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed his quill and the exam paper into his bag, which he slung over his back, and stood waiting for Sirius_Black to join him. Harry_Potter looked around and glimpsed snape a short way away, moving between the tables towards the doors to the entrance hall, still absorbed in his own exam paper. round-shouldered yet angular, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, and his oily hair was jumping about his face. a gang of chattering girls separated snape from James_Potter_I, Sirius_Black and lupin, and by planting himself in their midst, Harry_Potter managed to keep snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of James_Potter_I and his friends. ‘did you like question ten, Remus_Lupin?’ asked Sirius_Black as they emerged into the entrance hall. ‘loved it,’ said lupin briskly. ‘give five signs that identify the werewolf. excellent question.’ ‘d’you think you managed to get all the signs?’ said James_Potter_I in tones of mock concern. ‘think i did,’ said lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. ‘one: he’s sitting on my chair. two: he’s wearing my clothes. three: his name’s Remus_Lupin lupin.’ Peter_Pettigrew was the only one who didn’t laugh. ‘i got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail,’ he said anxiously, ‘but i couldn’t think what else –’ ‘how thick are you, Peter_Pettigrew?’ said James_Potter_I impatiently. ‘you run round with a werewolf once a month –’ ‘keep your voice down,’ implored lupin. Harry_Potter looked anxiously behind him again. snape remained close by, still buried in his exam questions – but this was snape’s memory and Harry_Potter was sure that if snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry_Potter, would not be able to follow James_Potter_I any further. to his intense relief, however, when James_Potter_I and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake, snape followed, still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going. by keeping a little ahead of him, Harry_Potter managed to maintain a close watch on James_Potter_I and the others. ‘well, i thought that paper was a piece of cake,’ he heard Sirius_Black say. ‘i’ll be surprised if i don’t get “outStanley_Shunpikeding” on it at least.’ ‘me too,’ said James_Potter_I. he put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling golden snitch. ‘where’d you get that?’ ‘Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoned it,’ said James_Potter_I casually. he started playing with the snitch, allowing it to fly as much as a foot away before seizing it again; his reflexes were excellent. Peter_Pettigrew watched him in awe. they stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry_Potter,Ronald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger had once spent a sunday finishing their homework, and threw themselves down on the grass. Harry_Potter looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to his delight, that snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes. he was as deeply immersed in the o.w.l. paper as ever, which left Harry_Potter free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree. the sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the great hall were sitting, with their shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the water. lupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius_Black stared around at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and bored, but very handsomely so. James_Potter_I was still playing with the snitch, letting it zoom further and further away, almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second. Peter_Pettigrew was watching him with his mouth open. every time James_Potter_I made a particularly difficult catch, Peter_Pettigrew gasped and applauded. after five minutes of this, Harry_Potter wondered why James_Potter_I didn’t tell Peter_Pettigrew to get a grip on himself, but James_Potter_I seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry_Potter noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting too tidy, and he also kept looking over at the girls by the water’s edge. ‘put that away, will you,’ said Sirius_Black finally, as James_Potter_I made a fine catch and Peter_Pettigrew let out a cheer, ‘before Peter_Pettigrew wets himself with excitement.’ Peter_Pettigrew turned slightly pink, but James_Potter_I grinned. ‘if it bothers you,’ he said, stuffing the snitch back in his pocket. Harry_Potter had the distinct impression that Sirius_Black was the only one for whom James_Potter_I would have stopped showing off. ‘i’m bored,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘wish it was full moon.’ ‘you might,’ said lupin darkly from behind his book. ‘we’ve still got transfiguration, if you’re bored you could test me. here …’ and he held out his book. but Sirius_Black snorted. ‘i don’t need to look at that rubbish, i know it all.’ ‘this’ll liven you up, Sirius_Black,’ said James_Potter_I quietly. ‘look who it is …’ Sirius_Black’s head turned. he became very still, like a dog that has scented a rabbit. ‘excellent,’ he said softly. ‘snivellus.’ Harry_Potter turned to see what Sirius_Black was looking at. snape was on his feet again, and was stowing the o.w.l. paper in his bag. as he left the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass, Sirius_Black and James_Potter_I stood up. lupin and Peter_Pettigrew remained sitting: lupin was still staring down at his book, though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows; Peter_Pettigrew was looking from Sirius_Black and James_Potter_I to snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face. ‘all right, snivellus?’ said James_Potter_I loudly. snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack: dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when James_Potter_I shouted, ‘expelliarmus!’ snape’s wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him. Sirius_Black let out a bark of laughter. ‘impedimenta!’ he said, pointing his wand at snape, who was knocked off his feet halfway through a dive towards his own fallen wand. students all around had turned to watch. some of them had got to their feet and were edging nearer. some looked apprehensive, others entertained. snape lay panting on the ground. James_Potter_I and Sirius_Black advanced on him, wands raised, James_Potter_I glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the water’s edge as he went. Peter_Pettigrew was on his feet now, watching hungrily, edging around lupin to get a clearer view. ‘how’d the exam go, snivelly?’ said James_Potter_I. ‘i was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment,’ said Sirius_Black viciously. ‘there’ll be great grease marks all over it, they won’t be able to read a word.’ several people watching laughed; snape was clearly unpopular. Peter_Pettigrew sniggered shrilly. snape was trying to get up, but the jinx was still operating on him; he was struggling, as though bound by invisible ropes. ‘you – wait,’ he panted, staring up at James_Potter_I with an expression of purest loathing, ‘you – wait!’ ‘wait for what?’ said Sirius_Black coolly. ‘what’re you going to do, snivelly, wipe your nose on us?’ snape let out a stream of mixed swear words and hexes, but with his wand ten feet away nothing happened. ‘wash out your mouth,’ said James_Potter_I coldly. ‘scourgify!’ pink soap bubbles streamed from snape’s mouth at once; the froth was covering his lips, making him gag, choking him – ‘leave him alone!’ James_Potter_I and Sirius_Black looked round. James_Potter_I’s free hand immediately jumped to his hair. it was one of the girls from the lake edge. she had thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders, and startlingly green almond-shaped eyes – Harry_Potter’s eyes. Harry_Potter’s mother. ‘all right, evans?’ said James_Potter_I, and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more mature. ‘leave him alone,’ Lily_J._Potter repeated. she was looking at James_Potter_I with every sign of great dislike. ‘what’s he done to you?’ ‘well,’ said James_Potter_I, appearing to deliberate the point, ‘it’s more the fact that he exists, if you know what i mean …’ many of the surrounding students laughed, Sirius_Black and Peter_Pettigrew included, but lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn’t, and nor did Lily_J._Potter. ‘you think you’re funny,’ she said coldly. ‘but you’re just an arrogant, bullying toerag, potter. leave him alone.’ ‘i will if you go out with me, evans,’ said James_Potter_I quickly. ‘go on … go out with me and i’ll never lay a wand on old snivelly again.’ behind him, the impediment jinx was wearing off. snape was beginning to inch towards his fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as he crawled. ‘i wouldn’t go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,’ said Lily_J._Potter. ‘bad luck, James_Potter_I,’ said Sirius_Black briskly, and turned back to snape. ‘oi!’ but too late; snape had directed his wand straight at James_Potter_I; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James_Potter_I’s face, spattering his robes with blood. James_Potter_I whirled about: a second flash of light later, snape was hanging upside-down in the air, his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of greying underpants. many people in the small crowd cheered; Sirius_Black, James_Potter_I and Peter_Pettigrew roared with laughter. Lily_J._Potter, whose furious expression had twitched for an inStanley_Shunpiket as though she was going to smile, said, ‘let him down!’ ‘certainly,’ said James_Potter_I and he jerked his wand upwards; snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground. disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius_Black said, ‘petrificus totalus!’ and snape keeled over again, rigid as a board. ‘leave him alone!’ Lily_J._Potter shouted. she had her own wand out now. James_Potter_I and Sirius_Black eyed it warily. ‘ah, evans, don’t make me hex you,’ said James_Potter_I earnestly. ‘take the curse off him, then!’ James_Potter_I sighed deeply, then turned to snape and muttered the counter-curse. ‘there you go,’ he said, as snape struggled to his feet. ‘you’re lucky evans was here, snivellus –’ ‘i don’t need help from filthy little mudbloods like her!’ Lily_J._Potter blinked. ‘fine,’ she said coolly. ‘i won’t bother in future. and i’d wash your pants if i were you, snivellus.’ ‘apologise  to evans!’ James_Potter_I roared at snape, his wand pointed threateningly at him. ‘i don’t want you to make him apologise,’ Lily_J._Potter shouted, rounding on James_Potter_I. ‘you’re as bad as he is.’ ‘what?’ yelped James_Potter_I. ‘i’d never call you a – you-know-what!’ ‘messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you’ve just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can – i’m surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. you make me sick.’ she turned on her heel and hurried away. ‘evans!’ James_Potter_I shouted after her. ‘hey, evans!’ but she didn’t look back. ‘what is it with her?’ said James_Potter_I, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him. ‘reading between the lines, i’d say she thinks you’re a bit conceited, mate,’ said Sirius_Black. ‘right,’ said James_Potter_I, who looked furious now, ‘right –’ there was another flash of light, and snape was once again hanging upside-down in the air. ‘who wants to see me take off snivelly’s pants?’ but whether James_Potter_I really did take off snape’s pants, Harry_Potter never found out. a hand had closed tight over his upper arm, closed with a pincer-like grip. wincing, Harry_Potter looked round to see who had hold of him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized snape Stanley_Shunpikeding right beside him, white with rage. ‘having fun?’ Harry_Potter felt himself rising into the air; the summer’s day evaporated around him; he was floating upwards through icy blackness, snape’s hand still tight upon his upper arm. then, with a swooping feeling as though he had turned head-over-heels in midair, his feet hit the stone floor of snape’s Mundungus_Fletchereon and he was Stanley_Shunpikeding again beside the pensieve on snape’s desk in the shadowy, present-day potion master’s study. ‘so,’ said snape, gripping Harry_Potter’s arm so tightly Harry_Potter’s hand was starting to feel numb. ‘so … been enjoying yourself, potter?’ ‘n-no,’ said Harry_Potter, trying to free his arm. it was scary: snape’s lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth were bared. ‘amusing man, your father, wasn’t he?’ said snape, shaking Harry_Potter so hard his glasses slipped down his nose. ‘i – didn’t –’ snape threw Harry_Potter from him with all his might. Harry_Potter fell hard on to the Mundungus_Fletchereon floor. ‘you will not tell anybody what you saw!’ snape bellowed. ‘no,’ said Harry_Potter, getting to his feet as far from snape as he could. ‘no, of course i w––’ ‘get out, get out, i don’t want to see you in this office ever again!’ and as Harry_Potter hurtled towards the door, a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head. he wrenched the door open and flew along the corridor, stopping only when he had put three floors between himself and snape. there he leaned against the wall, panting, and rubbing his bruised arm. he had no desire at all to return to gryffindor tower so early, nor to tellRonald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger what he had just seen. what was making Harry_Potter feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him; it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how snape had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as snape had always told him.
