the vanishing glass nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but privet drive had hardly changed at all. the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Vernon_Dursley_dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley_Dursley_dursley dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. yet Harry_Potter_potter potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. his aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. “up! get up! now!” Harry_Potter_potter woke with a start. his aunt rapped on the door  again. “up!” she screeched. Harry_Potter_potter heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. it had been a good one. there had been a flying motorcycle in it. he had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before. his aunt was back outside the door. “are you up yet?” she demanded. “nearly,” said Harry_Potter_potter. “well, get a move on, i want you to look after the bacon. and don’t you dare let it burn, i want everything perfect on duddy’s birthday.” Harry_Potter_potter groaned. “what did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door. “nothing, nothing …” Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry_Potter_potter got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. he found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry_Potter_potter was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. the table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s birthday presents. it looked as though Dudley_Dursley_dursley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. exactly why Dudley_Dursley_dursley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry_Potter_potter, as Dudley_Dursley_dursley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s favorite punching bag was Harry_Potter_potter, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry_Potter_potter didn’t look it, but he was very fast. perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry_Potter_potter had always been small and skinny for his age. he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s, and Dudley_Dursley_dursley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry_Potter_potter had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times Dudley_Dursley_dursley had punched him on the nose. the only thing Harry_Potter_potter liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of Harry_Potter_potter. he had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley was how he had gotten it. “in the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “and don’t ask questions.” don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys. uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley entered the kitchen as Harry_Potter_potter was turning over the bacon. “comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting. about once a week, uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry_Potter_potter needed a haircut. Harry_Potter_potter must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. Harry_Potter_potter was frying eggs by the time Dudley_Dursley_dursley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley_Dursley_dursley looked a lot like uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley. he had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley often said that Dudley_Dursley_dursley looked like a baby angel — Harry_Potter_potter often said that Dudley_Dursley_dursley looked like aPigwidgeonin a wig. Harry_Potter_potter put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley_Dursley_dursley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. his face fell. “thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “that’s two less than last year.” “darling, you haven’t counted Marjorie_Dursley_dursley’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from mommy and daddy.” “all right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley_Dursley_dursley, going red in the face. Harry_Potter_potter, who could see a huge Dudley_Dursley_dursley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley_Dursley_dursley turned the table over. aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, “and we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. how’s that, popkin? two more presents. is that all right?” Dudley_Dursley_dursley thought for a moment. it looked like hard work. finally he said slowly, “so i’ll have thirty … thirty …” “thirty-nine, sweetums,” said aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley. “oh.” Dudley_Dursley_dursley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “all right then.” uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley chuckled. “little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’atta boy, Dudley_Dursley_dursley!” he ruffled Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s hair. at that moment the telephone rang and aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley went to answer it while Harry_Potter_potter and uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley watched Dudley_Dursley_dursley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a vcr. he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. “bad news, Vernon_Dursley_dursley,” she said. “mrs. figg’s broken her leg. she can’t take him.” she jerked her head in Harry_Potter_potter’s direction. Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry_Potter_potter’s heart gave a leap. every year on Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. every year, Harry_Potter_potter was left behind with mrs. figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry_Potter_potter hated it there. the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs. figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned. “now what?” said aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley, looking furiously at Harry_Potter_potter as though he’d planned this. Harry_Potter_potter knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs. figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies, snowy, mr. paws, and Tufty again. “we could phone Marjorie_Dursley_dursley,” uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley suggested. “don’t be silly, Vernon_Dursley_dursley, she hates the boy.” the dursleys often spoke about Harry_Potter_potter like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t underStanley_Shunpike_shunpiked them, like a slug. “what about what’s-her-name, your friend — yvonne?” “on vacation in majorca,” snapped aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley. “you could just leave me here,” Harry_Potter_potter put in Hope_Howell_howellfully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s computer). aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon. “and come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled. “i won’t blow up the house,” said Harry_Potter_potter, but they weren’t listening. “i suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley slowly, “… and leave him in the car. …” “that cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. …” Dudley_Dursley_dursley began to cry loudly. in fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. “dinky duddydums, don’t cry, mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him. “i … don’t … want … him … t-t-to come!” Dudley_Dursley_dursley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “he always sp-spoils everything!” he shot Harry_Potter_potter a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms. just then, the doorbell rang — “oh, good lord, they’re here!” said aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley frantically — and a moment later, Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s best friend, Piers_Polkiss_polkiss polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers_Polkiss_polkiss was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. he was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley_Dursley_dursley hit them. Dudley_Dursley_dursley stopped pretending to cry at once. half an hour later, Harry_Potter_potter, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the dursleys’ car with Piers_Polkiss_polkiss and Dudley_Dursley_dursley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. his aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley had taken Harry_Potter_potter aside. “i’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry_Potter_potter’s, “i’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until christmas.” i’m not going to do anything,” said Harry_Potter_potter, “honestly …” but uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley didn’t believe him. no one ever did. the problem was, strange things often happened around Harry_Potter_potter and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didn’t make them happen. once, aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley, tired of Harry_Potter_potter coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley_Dursley_dursley had laughed himself silly at Harry_Potter_potter, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley had sheared it off. he had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly. another time, aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s (brown with orange puff balls). the harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry_Potter_potter. aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry_Potter_potter wasn’t punished. on the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry_Potter_potter’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. the dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry_Potter_potter’s headmistress telling them Harry_Potter_potter had been climbing school buildings. but all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry_Potter_potter supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump. but today, nothing was going to go wrong. it was even worth being with Dudley_Dursley_dursley and Piers_Polkiss_polkiss to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or mrs. figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. while he drove, uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley complained to aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley. he liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry_Potter_potter, the council, Harry_Potter_potter, the bank, and Harry_Potter_potter were just a few of his favorite subjects. this morning, it was motorcycles. “… roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. “i had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry_Potter_potter, remembering suddenly. “it was flying.” uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley nearly crashed into the car in front. he turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry_Potter_potter, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “motorcycles don’t fly!” Dudley_Dursley_dursley and Piers_Polkiss_polkiss sniggered. “i know they don’t,” said Harry_Potter_potter. “it was only a dream.” but he wished he hadn’t said anything. if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. the dursleys bought Dudley_Dursley_dursley and Piers_Polkiss_polkiss large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry_Potter_potter what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. it wasn’t bad, either, Harry_Potter_potter thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley_Dursley_dursley, except that it wasn’t blond. Harry_Potter_potter had the best morning he’d had in a long time. he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that Dudley_Dursley_dursley and Piers_Polkiss_polkiss, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. they ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley_Dursley_dursley had a tantrum because his kNicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_de_mimsy-porpingtonerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley bought him another one and Harry_Potter_potter was allowed to finish the first. Harry_Potter_potter felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. after lunch they went to the reptile house. it was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley_Dursley_dursley and Piers_Polkiss_polkiss wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man- crushing pythons. Dudley_Dursley_dursley quickly found the largest snake in the place. it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. in fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley_Dursley_dursley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “make it move,” he whined at his father. uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “do it again,” Dudley_Dursley_dursley ordered. uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “this is boring,” Dudley_Dursley_dursley moaned. he shuffled away. Harry_Potter_potter moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. he wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of itself — no company except stupid people boredom drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry_Potter_potter’s. it winked. Harry_Potter_potter stared. then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. they weren’t. he looked back at the snake and winked, too. the snake jerked its head toward uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley and Dudley_Dursley_dursley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. it gave Harry_Potter_potter a look that said quite plainly: “i get that all the time.” “i know,” Harry_Potter_potter murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “it must be really annoying.” the snake nodded vIgor_Karkaroff_karkaroffously. “where do you come from, anyway?” Harry_Potter_potter asked. the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry_Potter_potter peered at it. boa constrictor, brazil. “was it nice there?” the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry_Potter_potter read on: this specimen was bred in the zoo. “oh, i see — so you’ve never been to brazil?” as the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry_Potter_potter made both of them jump. “Dudley_Dursley_dursley! Vernon_Dursley_dursley! come and look at this snake! you won’t believe what it’s doing!” Dudley_Dursley_dursley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. “out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry_Potter_potter in the ribs. caught by surprise, Harry_Potter_potter fell hard on the concrete floor. what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers_Polkiss_polkiss and Dudley_Dursley_dursley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry_Potter_potter sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. as the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry_Potter_potter could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “brazil, here i come. … thanksss, amigo.” the keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “but the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” the zoo director himself made aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers_Polkiss_polkiss and Dudley_Dursley_dursley could only gibber. as far as Harry_Potter_potter had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley’s car, Dudley_Dursley_dursley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers_Polkiss_polkiss was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. but worst of all, for Harry_Potter_potter at least, was Piers_Polkiss_polkiss calming down enough to say, “Harry_Potter_potter was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry_Potter_potter?” uncle Vernon_Dursley_dursley waited until Piers_Polkiss_polkiss was safely out of the house before starting on Harry_Potter_potter. he was so angry he could hardly speak. he managed to say, “go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry_Potter_potter lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. he didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the dursleys were asleep yet. until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. he’d lived with the dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. he couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. this, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. he couldn’t remember his parents at all. his aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. there were no photographs of them in the house. when he had been younger, Harry_Potter_potter had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the dursleys were his only family. yet sometimes he thought (or maybe Hope_Howell_howelld) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. very strange strangers they were, too. a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley and Dudley_Dursley_dursley. after asking Harry_Potter_potter furiously if he knew the man, aunt Petunia_Dursley_dursley had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. a wild- looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry_Potter_potter tried to get a closer look. at school, Harry_Potter_potter had no one. everybody knew that Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s gang hated that odd Harry_Potter_potter potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley_Dursley_dursley’s gang.
