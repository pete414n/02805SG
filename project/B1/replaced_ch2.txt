the vanishing glass nearly ten years had passed since Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but privet drive had hardly changed at all. the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Vernon_Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley_Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. yet Harry_Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. his aunt Petunia_Dursley was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. “up! get up! now!” Harry_Potter woke with a start. his aunt rapped on the door   again. “up!” she screeched. Harry_Potter heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. it had been a good one. there had been a flying motorcycle in it. he had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before. his aunt was back outside the door. “are you up yet?” she demanded. “nearly,” said Harry_Potter. “well, get a move on, i want you to look after the bacon. and don’t you dare let it burn, i want everything perfect on duddy’s birthday.” Harry_Potter groaned. “what did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door. “nothing, nothing …” Dudley_Dursley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry_Potter got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. he found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry_Potter was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. the table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley_Dursley’s birthday presents. it looked as though Dudley_Dursley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. exactly why Dudley_Dursley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry_Potter, as Dudley_Dursley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley_Dursley’s favorite punching bag was Harry_Potter, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry_Potter didn’t look it, but he was very fast. perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry_Potter had always been small and skinny for his age. he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley_Dursley’s, and Dudley_Dursley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry_Potter had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times Dudley_Dursley had punched him on the nose. the only thing Harry_Potter liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of Harry_Potter. he had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt Petunia_Dursley was how he had gotten it. “in the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “and don’t ask questions.” don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley. uncle Vernon_Dursley entered the kitchen as Harry_Potter was turning over the bacon. “comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting. about once a week, uncle Vernon_Dursley looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry_Potter needed a haircut. Harry_Potter must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. Harry_Potter was frying eggs by the time Dudley_Dursley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley_Dursley looked a lot like uncle Vernon_Dursley. he had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. aunt Petunia_Dursley often said that Dudley_Dursley looked like a baby angel — Harry_Potter often said that Dudley_Dursley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry_Potter put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley_Dursley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. his face fell. “thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “that’s two less than last year.” “darling, you haven’t counted Marjorie_Dursley’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from mommy and daddy.” “all right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley_Dursley, going red in the face. Harry_Potter, who could see a huge Dudley_Dursley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley_Dursley turned the table over. aunt Petunia_Dursley obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, “and we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. how’s that, popkin? two more presents. is that all right?” Dudley_Dursley thought for a moment. it looked like hard work. finally he said slowly, “so i’ll have thirty … thirty …” “thirty-nine, sweetums,” said aunt Petunia_Dursley. “oh.” Dudley_Dursley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “all right then.” uncle Vernon_Dursley chuckled. “little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’atta boy, Dudley_Dursley!” he ruffled Dudley_Dursley’s hair. at that moment the telephone rang and aunt Petunia_Dursley went to answer it while Harry_Potter and uncle Vernon_Dursley watched Dudley_Dursley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a vcr. he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt Petunia_Dursley came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. “bad news, Vernon_Dursley,” she said. “AraBellatrix_Lestrange_Figg’s broken her leg. she can’t take him.” she jerked her head in Harry_Potter’s direction. Dudley_Dursley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry_Potter’s heart gave a leap. every year on Dudley_Dursley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. every year, Harry_Potter was left behind with AraBellatrix_Lestrange_Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry_Potter hated it there. the whole house smelled of cabbage and AraBellatrix_Lestrange_Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned. “now what?” said aunt Petunia_Dursley, looking furiously at Harry_Potter as though he’d planned this. Harry_Potter knew he ought to feel sorry that AraBellatrix_Lestrange_Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies, snowy, mr. paws, and Tufty again. “we could phone Marjorie_Dursley,” uncle Vernon_Dursley suggested. “don’t be silly, Vernon_Dursley, she hates the boy.” Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley often spoke about Harry_Potter like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug. “what about what’s-her-name, your friend — yvonne?” “on vacation in majorca,” snapped aunt Petunia_Dursley. “you could just leave me here,” Harry_Potter put in Hope_Howellfully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley_Dursley’s computer). aunt Petunia_Dursley looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon. “and come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled. “i won’t blow up the house,” said Harry_Potter, but they weren’t listening. “i suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said aunt Petunia_Dursley slowly, “… and leave him in the car. …” “that cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. …” Dudley_Dursley began to cry loudly. in fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. “dinky duddydums, don’t cry, mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him. “i … don’t … want … him … t-t-to come!” Dudley_Dursley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “he always sp-spoils everything!” he shot Harry_Potter a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms. just then, the doorbell rang — “oh, good lord, they’re here!” said aunt Petunia_Dursley frantically — and a moment later, Dudley_Dursley’s best friend, Piers_Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers_Polkiss was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. he was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley_Dursley hit them. Dudley_Dursley stopped pretending to cry at once. half an hour later, Harry_Potter, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley’ car with Piers_Polkiss and Dudley_Dursley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. his aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, uncle Vernon_Dursley had taken Harry_Potter aside. “i’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry_Potter’s, “i’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until christmas.” i’m not going to do anything,” said Harry_Potter, “honestly …” but uncle Vernon_Dursley didn’t believe him. no one ever did. the problem was, strange things often happened around Harry_Potter and it was just no good telling Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley he didn’t make them happen. once, aunt Petunia_Dursley, tired of Harry_Potter coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley_Dursley had laughed himself silly at Harry_Potter, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt Petunia_Dursley had sheared it off. he had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly. another time, aunt Petunia_Dursley had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley_Dursley’s (brown with orange puff balls). the harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry_Potter. aunt Petunia_Dursley had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry_Potter wasn’t punished. on the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley_Dursley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry_Potter’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley had received a very angry letter from Harry_Potter’s headmistress telling them Harry_Potter had been climbing school buildings. but all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at uncle Vernon_Dursley through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry_Potter supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump. but today, nothing was going to go wrong. it was even worth being with Dudley_Dursley and Piers_Polkiss to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or AraBellatrix_Lestrange_Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. while he drove, uncle Vernon_Dursley complained to aunt Petunia_Dursley. he liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry_Potter, the council, Harry_Potter, the bank, and Harry_Potter were just a few of his favorite subjects. this morning, it was motorcycles. “… roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. “i had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry_Potter, remembering suddenly. “it was flying.” uncle Vernon_Dursley nearly crashed into the car in front. he turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry_Potter, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “motorcycles don’t fly!” Dudley_Dursley and Piers_Polkiss sniggered. “i know they don’t,” said Harry_Potter. “it was only a dream.” but he wished he hadn’t said anything. if there was one thing Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley bought Dudley_Dursley and Piers_Polkiss large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry_Potter what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. it wasn’t bad, either, Harry_Potter thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley_Dursley, except that it wasn’t blond. Harry_Potter had the best morning he’d had in a long time. he was careful to walk a little way apart from Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley so that Dudley_Dursley and Piers_Polkiss, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. they ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley_Dursley had a tantrum because his kNicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtonerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, uncle Vernon_Dursley bought him another one and Harry_Potter was allowed to finish the first. Harry_Potter felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. after lunch they went to the reptile house. it was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley_Dursley and Piers_Polkiss wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man- crushing pythons. Dudley_Dursley quickly found the largest snake in the place. it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle Vernon_Dursley’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. in fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley_Dursley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “make it move,” he whined at his father. uncle Vernon_Dursley tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “do it again,” Dudley_Dursley ordered. uncle Vernon_Dursley rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “this is boring,” Dudley_Dursley moaned. he shuffled away. Harry_Potter moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. he wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of itself — no company except stupid people boredom drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was aunt Petunia_Dursley hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry_Potter’s. it winked. Harry_Potter stared. then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. they weren’t. he looked back at the snake and winked, too. the snake jerked its head toward uncle Vernon_Dursley and Dudley_Dursley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. it gave Harry_Potter a look that said quite plainly: “i get that all the time.” “i know,” Harry_Potter murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “it must be really annoying.” the snake nodded vIgor_Karkaroffously. “where do you come from, anyway?” Harry_Potter asked. the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry_Potter peered at it. boa constrictor, brazil. “was it nice there?” the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry_Potter read on: this specimen was bred in the zoo. “oh, i see — so you’ve never been to brazil?” as the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry_Potter made both of them jump. “Dudley_Dursley! Vernon_Dursley! come and look at this snake! you won’t believe what it’s doing!” Dudley_Dursley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. “out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry_Potter in the ribs. caught by surprise, Harry_Potter fell hard on the concrete floor. what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers_Polkiss and Dudley_Dursley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry_Potter sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. as the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry_Potter could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “brazil, here i come. … thanksss, amigo.” the keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “but the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” the zoo director himself made aunt Petunia_Dursley a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers_Polkiss and Dudley_Dursley could only gibber. as far as Harry_Potter had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in uncle Vernon_Dursley’s car, Dudley_Dursley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers_Polkiss was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. but worst of all, for Harry_Potter at least, was Piers_Polkiss calming down enough to say, “Harry_Potter was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry_Potter?” uncle Vernon_Dursley waited until Piers_Polkiss was safely out of the house before starting on Harry_Potter. he was so angry he could hardly speak. he managed to say, “go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and aunt Petunia_Dursley had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry_Potter lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. he didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley were asleep yet. until they were, he  couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. he’d lived with Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. he couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. this, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. he couldn’t remember his parents at all. his aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. there were no photographs of them in the house. when he had been younger, Harry_Potter had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley were his only family. yet sometimes he thought (or maybe Hope_Howelld) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. very strange strangers they were, too. a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt Petunia_Dursley and Dudley_Dursley. after asking Harry_Potter furiously if he knew the man, aunt Petunia_Dursley had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. a wild- looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry_Potter tried to get a closer look. at school, Harry_Potter had no one. everybody knew that Dudley_Dursley’s gang hated that odd Harry_Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley_Dursley’s gang.
