the letters from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry_Potter his longest-ever punishment. by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley_Dursley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old mrs. figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutches. Harry_Potter was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley_Dursley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers_Polkiss, Dennis_Creevey, malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley_Dursley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. the rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley_Dursley’s favorite sport: Harry_Potter hunting. this was why Harry_Potter spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of Hope_Howell. when september came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley_Dursley. Dudley_Dursley had been accepted at uncle Vernon_Dursley’s old private school, smeltings. Piers_Polkiss polkiss was going there too. Harry_Potter, on the other hand, was going to stonewall high, the local   public school. Dudley_Dursley thought this was very funny. “they stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall,” he told Harry_Potter. “want to come upstairs and practice?” “no, thanks,” said Harry_Potter. “the poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” then he ran, before Dudley_Dursley could work out what he’d said. one day in july, aunt Petunia_Dursley took Dudley_Dursley to london to buy his smeltings uniform, leaving Harry_Potter at mrs. figg’s. mrs. figg wasn’t as bad as usual. it turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. she let Harry_Potter watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years. that evening, Dudley_Dursley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange kNicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtonerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. they also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. this was supposed to be good training for later life. as he looked at Dudley_Dursley in his new kNicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtonerbockers, uncle Vernon_Dursley said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. aunt Petunia_Dursley burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her ickle Dudley_Dursleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry_Potter didn’t trust himself to speak. he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. *  *  * there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry_Potter went in for breakfast. it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. he went to have a look. the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. “what’s this?” he asked aunt Petunia_Dursley. her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. “your new school uniform,” she said. Harry_Potter looked in the bowl again. “oh,” he said, “i didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” “don’t be stupid,” snapped aunt Petunia_Dursley. “i’m dyeing some of Dudley_Dursley’s old things gray for you. it’ll look just like everyone else’s when i’ve finished.” Harry_Potter seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Dudley_Dursley and uncle Vernon_Dursley came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry_Potter’s new uniform. uncle Vernon_Dursley opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley_Dursley banged his smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. “get the mail, Dudley_Dursley,” said uncle Vernon_Dursley from behind his paper. “make Harry_Potter get it.” “get the mail, Harry_Potter.” “make Dudley_Dursley get it.” “poke him with your smelting stick, Dudley_Dursley.” Harry_Potter dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail. three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from uncle Vernon_Dursley’s sister Marjorie_Dursley, who was vacationing on the isle of wight, a brown envelope that looked like a William_Weasley, and — a letter for Harry_Potter. Harry_Potter picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. no one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. who would? he had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: the envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. there was no stamp. turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry_Potter saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a   badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter h. “hurry up, boy!” shouted uncle Vernon_Dursley from the kitchen. “what are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” he chuckled at his own joke. Harry_Potter went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. he handed uncle Vernon_Dursley the William_Weasley and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. uncle Vernon_Dursley ripped open the William_Weasley, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. “Marjorie_Dursley’s ill,” he informed aunt Petunia_Dursley. “ate a funny whelk …” “dad!” something!” said Dudley_Dursley  suddenly.  “dad, Harry_Potter’s got Harry_Potter was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle Vernon_Dursley. “that’s mine!” said Harry_Potter, trying to snatch it back. “who’d be writing to you?” sneered uncle Vernon_Dursley, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. and it didn’t stop there. within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. “p-p-Petunia_Dursley!” he gasped. Dudley_Dursley tried to grab the letter to read it, but uncle Vernon_Dursley held it high out of his reach. aunt Petunia_Dursley took it curiously and read the first line. for a moment it looked as though she might faint. she clutched her throat and made a choking noise. “Vernon_Dursley! oh my goodness — Vernon_Dursley!” they stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry_Potter and Dudley_Dursley were still in the room. Dudley_Dursley wasn’t used to being ignored. he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick. “i want to read that letter,” he said loudly. “i want to read it,” said Harry_Potter furiously, “as it’s mine.” “get out, both of you,” croaked uncle Vernon_Dursley, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. Harry_Potter didn’t move. “i want my letter!” he shouted. “let me see it!” demanded Dudley_Dursley. “out!” roared uncle Vernon_Dursley, and he took both Harry_Potter and Dudley_Dursley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry_Potter and Dudley_Dursley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley_Dursley won, so Harry_Potter, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. “Vernon_Dursley,” aunt Petunia_Dursley was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? you don’t think they’re watching the house?” “watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered uncle Vernon_Dursley wildly. “but what should we do, Vernon_Dursley? should we write back? tell them we don’t want —” Harry_Potter could see uncle Vernon_Dursley’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. “no,” he said finally. “no, we’ll ignore it. if they don’t get an answer. … yes, that’s best … we won’t do anything. …” “but —” “i’m not having one in the house, Petunia_Dursley! didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?” that evening when he got back from work, uncle Vernon_Dursley did something he’d never done before; he visited Harry_Potter in his cupboard. “where’s my letter?” said Harry_Potter, the moment uncle Vernon_Dursley had squeezed through the door. “who’s writing to me?” “no one. it was addressed to you by mistake,” said uncle Vernon_Dursley shortly. “i have burned it.” “it was not a mistake,” said Harry_Potter angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.” “silence!” yelled uncle Vernon_Dursley, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. “er — yes, Harry_Potter — about this cupboard. your aunt and i have been thinking … you’re really getting a bit big for it … we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley_Dursley’s second bedroom.” “why?” said Harry_Potter.  “don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “take this stuff upstairs, now.” the dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for uncle Vernon_Dursley and aunt Petunia_Dursley, one for visitors (usually uncle Vernon_Dursley’s sister, Marjorie_Dursley), one where Dudley_Dursley slept, and one where Dudley_Dursley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. it only took Harry_Potter one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. he sat down on the bed and stared around him. nearly everything in here was broken. the month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley_Dursley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley_Dursley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley_Dursley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley_Dursley had sat on it. other shelves were full of books. they were the only things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched. from downstairs came the sound of Dudley_Dursley bawling at his mother, “i don’t want him in there … i need that room … make him get out. …” Harry_Potter sighed and stretched out on the bed. yesterday he’d have given anything to be up here. today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley_Dursley was in shock. he’d screamed, whacked his father with his smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry_Potter was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. uncle Vernon_Dursley and aunt Petunia_Dursley kept looking at each other darkly. when the mail arrived, uncle Vernon_Dursley, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry_Potter, made Dudley_Dursley go and get it. they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall. then he shouted, “there’s another one! ‘mr. h. potter, the smallest bedroom, 4 privet drive —’ ”  with a strangled cry, uncle Vernon_Dursley leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry_Potter right behind him. uncle Vernon_Dursley had to wrestle Dudley_Dursley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry_Potter had grabbed uncle Vernon_Dursley around the neck from behind. after a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick, uncle Vernon_Dursley straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry_Potter’s letter clutched in his hand. “go to your cupboard — i mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry_Potter. “Dudley_Dursley — go — just go.” Harry_Potter walked round and round his new room. someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. surely that meant they’d try again? and this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. he had a plan. the repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry_Potter turned it off quickly and dressed silently he mustn’t wake the dursleys. he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first. his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door — “aaaaarrrgh!” Harry_Potter leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive! lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry_Potter realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. uncle Vernon_Dursley had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry_Potter didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. he shouted at Harry_Potter for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry_Potter shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into uncle Vernon_Dursley’s lap. Harry_Potter could see three letters addressed in green ink. “i want —” he began, but uncle Vernon_Dursley was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. uncle Vernon_Dursley didn’t go to work that day. he stayed at home  and nailed up the mail slot. “see,” he explained to aunt Petunia_Dursley through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.” “i’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon_Dursley.” “oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia_Dursley, they’re not like you and me,” said uncle Vernon_Dursley, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt Petunia_Dursley had just brought him. on friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry_Potter. as they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. uncle Vernon_Dursley stayed at home again. after burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. he hummed “tiptoe through the tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises. on saturday, things began to get out of hand. twenty-four letters to Harry_Potter found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt Petunia_Dursley through the living room window. while uncle Vernon_Dursley made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, aunt Petunia_Dursley shredded the letters in her food processor. “who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley_Dursley asked Harry_Potter in amazement. *  *  * on sunday morning, uncle Vernon_Dursley sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. “no post on sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —” something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. the dursleys ducked, but Harry_Potter leapt   into the air trying to catch one — “out! out!” uncle Vernon_Dursley seized Harry_Potter around the waist and threw him into the hall. when aunt Petunia_Dursley and Dudley_Dursley had run out with their arms over their faces, uncle Vernon_Dursley slammed the door shut. they could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. “that does it,” said uncle Vernon_Dursley, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. we’re going away. just pack some clothes. no arguments!” he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley_Dursley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, vcr, and computer in his sports bag. they drove. and they drove. even aunt Petunia_Dursley didn’t dare ask where they were going. every now and then uncle Vernon_Dursley would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. “shake ’em off … shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this. they didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. by nightfall Dudley_Dursley was howling. he’d never had such a bad day in his life. he was hungry, he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. uncle Vernon_Dursley stopped at last outside a Gloomy_nuns-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley_Dursley and Harry_Potter shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley_Dursley snored but Harry_Potter stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering. … they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. “ ’scuse me, but is one of you mr. h. potter? only i got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.”  she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Harry_Potter made a grab for the letter but uncle Vernon_Dursley knocked his hand out of the way. the woman stared. “i’ll take them,” said uncle Vernon_Dursley, Stanley_Shunpikeding up quickly and following her from the dining room. *  *  *  “wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” aunt Petunia_Dursley suggested timidly, hours later, but uncle Vernon_Dursley didn’t seem to hear her. exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. he drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. “daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley_Dursley asked aunt Petunia_Dursley dully late that afternoon. uncle Vernon_Dursley had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. it started to rain. great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley_Dursley sniveled. “it’s monday,” he told his mother. “the great humberto’s on tonight. i want to stay somewhere with a television.” monday. this reminded Harry_Potter of something. if it was monday — and you could usually count on Dudley_Dursley to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, tuesday, was Harry_Potter’s eleventh birthday. of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle Vernon_Dursley’s old socks. still, you weren’t eleven every day. uncle Vernon_Dursley was back and he was smiling. he was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer aunt Petunia_Dursley when she asked what he’d bought. “found the perfect place!” he said. “come on! everyone out!” it was very cold outside the car. uncle Vernon_Dursley was pointing    at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. one thing was certain, there was no television in there. “storm forecast for tonight!” said uncle Vernon_Dursley gleefully, clapping his hands together. “and this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!” a toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. “i’ve already got us some rations,” said uncle Vernon_Dursley, “so all aboard!” it was freezing in the boat. icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. after what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where uncle Vernon_Dursley, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. the inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. there were only two rooms. uncle Vernon_Dursley’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. “could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully. he was in a very good mood. obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry_Potter privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all. as night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. aunt Petunia_Dursley found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley_Dursley on the moth-eaten sofa. she and uncle Vernon_Dursley went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry_Potter was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry_Potter couldn’t sleep. he shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley_Dursley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. the lighted dial of Dudley_Dursley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry_Potter he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. five minutes to go. Harry_Potter heard something creak outside. he Hope_Howelld the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. four minutes to go. maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow. three minutes to go. was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? and (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? was the rock crumbling into the sea? one minute to go and he’d be eleven. thirty seconds … twenty … ten … nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley_Dursley up, just to annoy him — three … two … one … boom. the whole shack shivered and Harry_Potter sat bolt upright, staring at the door. someone was outside, knocking to come in.
