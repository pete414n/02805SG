chapter 29 the lost diadem “Neville_Longbottom — what the — how — ?” but Neville_Longbottom had spotted Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger, and with yells of delight was hugging them too. the longer Harry_Potter looked at Neville_Longbottom, the worse he appeared: one of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. nevertheless, his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione_Granger and said again, “i knew you’d come! kept telling Seamus_Finnigan it was a matter of time!” “Neville_Longbottom, what’s happened to you?” “what? this?” Neville_Longbottom dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. “this is nothing. Seamus_Finnigan is worse. you’ll see. shall we get going then? oh,” he turned to Aberforth_Dumbledore, “ab, there might be a couple more people on the way.” “couple more?” repeated Aberforth_Dumbledore ominously. “what d’you mean, a couple more, longbottom? there’s a curfew and a caterwauling charm on the whole village!” “i know, that’s why they’ll be apparating directly into the bar,” said Neville_Longbottom. “just send them down the passage when they get here, will you? thanks a lot.” Neville_Longbottom held out his hand to Hermione_Granger and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ronald_Weasley followed, then Neville_Longbottom. Harry_Potter addressed Aberforth_Dumbledore. “i don’t know how to thank you. you’ve saved our lives twice.” “look after ’em, then,” said Aberforth_Dumbledore gruffly. “i might not be able to save ’em a third time.” Harry_Potter clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind ariana’s portrait. there were smooth stone steps on the other side: it looked as though the passageway had been there for years. brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall. “how long’s this been here?” Ronald_Weasley asked as they set off. “it isn’t on the marauder’s map, is it, Harry_Potter? i thought there were only seven passages in and out of school?” “they sealed off all of those before the start of the year,” said Neville_Longbottom. “there’s no chance of getting through any of them now, not with curses over the entrances and death eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.” he started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. “never mind that stuff. … is it true? did you break into Gringotts_Head_Goblin? did you escape on a dragon? it’s everywhere, everyone’s talking about it, Terry_Boot got beaten up by carrow for yelling about it in the great hall at dinner!” “yeah, it’s true,” said Harry_Potter. Neville_Longbottom laughed gleefully. “what did you do with the dragon?” “released it into the wild,” said Ronald_Weasley “Hermione_Granger was all for keeping it as a pet —” “don’t exaggerate, Ronald_Weasley —” “but what have you been doing? people have been saying you’ve just been on the run, Harry_Potter, but i don’t think so. i think you’ve been up to something.” “you’re right,” said Harry_Potter, “but tell us about hogwarts, Neville_Longbottom, we haven’t heard anything.” “it’s been … well, it’s not really like hogwarts anymore,” said Neville_Longbottom, the smile fading from his face as he spoke. “do you know about Alecto_Carrow and Amycus_Carrow?” “those two death eaters who teach here?” “they do more than teach,” said Neville_Longbottom. “they’re in charge of all discipline. they like punishment, Alecto_Carrow and Amycus_Carrow.” “like umbridge?” “nah, they make her look tame. the other teachers are all supposed to refer us to Alecto_Carrow and Amycus_Carrow if we do anything wrong. they don’t, though, if they can avoid it. you can tell they all hate them as much as we do. “Amycus_Carrow, the bloke, he teaches what used to be defense against the dark arts, except now it’s just the dark arts. we’re supposed to practice the cruciatus curse on people who’ve earned detentions —” “what?” Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger’s united voices echoed up and down the passage. “yeah,” said Neville_Longbottom. “that’s how i got this one,” he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek, “i refused to do it. some people are into it, though; crabbe and Goyle love it. first time they’ve ever been top in anything, i expect. “Alecto_Carrow, Amycus_Carrow’s sister, teaches muggle studies, which is compulsory for everyone. we’ve all got to listen to her explain how muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. i got this one,” he indicated another slash to his face, “for asking her how much muggle blood she and her brother have got.” “blimey, Neville_Longbottom,” said Ronald_Weasley “there’s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.” “you didn’t hear her,” said Neville_Longbottom. “you wouldn’t have stood it either. the thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone Hope_Howell. i used to notice that when you did it, Harry_Potter.” “but they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said Ronald_Weasley wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and Neville_Longbottom’s injuries were thrown into even greater relief. Neville_Longbottom shrugged. “doesn’t matter. they don’t want to spill too much pure blood, so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually kill us.” Harry_Potter did not know what was worse, the things that Neville_Longbottom was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them. “the only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble. they get taken hostage. old Xenophilius_Lovegood lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in the quibbler, so they dragged Luna_Lovegood off the train on the way back for christmas.” “Neville_Longbottom, she’s all right, we’ve seen her —” “yeah, i know, she managed to get a message to me.” from his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry_Potter recognized it as one of the fake galleons that Albus_Dumbledore’s army had used to send one another messages. “these have been great,” said Neville_Longbottom, beaming at Hermione_Granger. “Alecto_Carrow and Amycus_Carrow never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. we used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: Albus_Dumbledore’s army, still recruiting, stuff like that. snape hated it.” “you used to?” said Harry_Potter, who had notiCedric_Diggory the past tense. “well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said Neville_Longbottom. “we lost Luna_Lovegood at christmas, and Ginevra_Weasley never came back after easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. Alecto_Carrow and Amycus_Carrow seemed to know i was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael_Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they’d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. that scared people off.” “no kidding,” muttered Ronald_Weasley as the passage began to slope upward. “yeah, well, i couldn’t ask people to go through what Michael_Corner did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. but we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. that’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, i suppose, and they went for gran.” “they what?” said Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger together. “yeah,” said Neville_Longbottom, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, “well, you can see their thinking. it had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, i s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. thing was,” he faCedric_Diggory them, and Harry_Potter was astonished to see that he was grinning, “they bit off a bit more than they could chew with gran. little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn’t need to send anyone particularly powerful. anyway,” Neville_Longbottom laughed, “dawlish is still in st. mungo’s and gran’s on the run. she sent me a letter,” he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, “telling me she was proud of me, that i’m my parents’ son, and to keep it up.” “cool,” said Ronald_Weasley “yeah,” said Neville_Longbottom happily. “only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, they decided hogwarts could do without me after all. i don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to azkaban; either way, i knew it was time to disappear.” “but,” said Ronald_Weasley looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t — aren’t we heading straight back into hogwarts?” “ ’course,” said Neville_Longbottom. “you’ll see. we’re here.” they turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind ariana’s portrait. Neville_Longbottom pushed it open and climbed through. as Harry_Potter followed, he heard Neville_Longbottom call out to unseen people: “look who it is! didn’t i tell you?” as Harry_Potter emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were several screams and yells: “Harry_Potter!” “it’s potter, it’s potter!” “ron!” “Hermione_Granger!” he had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. the next moment, he, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people: they might just have won a quidditch final. “okay, okay, calm down!” Neville_Longbottom called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry_Potter was able to take in their surroundings. he did not recognize the room at all. it was enormous, and looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship’s cabin. multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry_Potter saw the gold gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of ravenclaw, on blue. the silver and green of slytherin alone were absent. there were bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden- cased wireless. “where are we?” “room of requirement, of course!” said Neville_Longbottom. “surpassed itself, hasn’t it? Alecto_Carrow and Amycus_Carrow were chasing me, and i knew i had just one chance for a hideout: i managed to get through the door and this is what i found! well, it wasn’t exactly like this when i arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just gryffindor hangings. but it’s expanded as more and more of the d.a. have arrived.” “and Alecto_Carrow and Amycus_Carrow can’t get in?” asked Harry_Potter, looking around for the door. “no,” said Seamus_Finnigan, whom Harry_Potter had not recognized until he spoke: Seamus_Finnigan’s face was bruised and puffy. “it’s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can’t get at us, the door won’t open. it’s all down to Neville_Longbottom. he really gets this room. you’ve got to ask it for exactly what you need — like, ‘i don’t want any carrow supporters to be able to get in’ — and it’ll do it for you! you’ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes! Neville_Longbottom’s the man!” “it’s quite straightforward, really,” said Neville_Longbottom modestly. “i’d been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing i could get something to eat, and that’s when the passage to the hog’s head opened up. i went through it and met Aberforth_Dumbledore. he’s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that’s the one thing the room doesn’t really do.” “yeah, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to gamp’s law of elemental transfiguration,” said Ronald_Weasley to general astonishment. “so we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said Seamus_Finnigan, “and it just makes more hammocks every time we need them, and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up —” “— and thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,” supplied Lavender_Brown, whom Harry_Potter had not notiCedric_Diggory until that point. now that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces. both patil twins were there, as were Terry_Boot, Ernest_Prangmacmillan, Anthony_Goldstein, and Michael_Corner. “tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernest_Macmillan. “there’ve been so many rumors, we’ve been trying to keep up with you on Kingsley_Shacklebolt.” he pointed at the wireless. “you didn’t break into Gringotts_Head_Goblin?” “they did!” said Neville_Longbottom. “and the dragon’s true too!” there was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ronald_Weasley took a bow. “what were you after?” asked Seamus_Finnigan eagerly. before any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry_Potter felt a terrible, scorching pain in the Harry_Potter scar. as he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the room of requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and voldemort’s scream of fury vibrated inside his head. with an enormous effort he pulled out of voldemort’s mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the room of requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ronald_Weasley holding him up. “are you all right, Harry_Potter?” Neville_Longbottom was saying. “want to sit down? i expect you’re tired, aren’t — ?” “no,” said Harry_Potter. he looked at Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger, trying to tell them without words that voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other horcruxes. time was running out fast: if voldemort chose to visit hogwarts next, they would miss their chance. “we need to get going,” he said, and their expressions told him that they understood. “what are we going to do, then, Harry_Potter?” asked Seamus_Finnigan. “what’s the plan?” “plan?” repeated Harry_Potter. he was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing again to voldemort’s rage: his scar was still burning. “well, there’s something we — Ronald_Weasley Hermione_Granger, and i — need to do, and then we’ll get out of here.” nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville_Longbottom looked confused. “what d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?” “we haven’t come back to stay,” said Harry_Potter, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the pain. “there’s something important we need to do —” “what is it?” “i — i can’t tell you.” there was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville_Longbottom’s brows contracted. “why can’t you tell us? it’s something to do with fighting you-know- who, right?” “well, yeah —” “then we’ll help you.” the other members of Albus_Dumbledore’s army were nodding, some enthusiastically, others solemnly. a couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action. “you don’t understand.” Harry_Potter seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. “we — we can’t tell you. we’ve got to do it — alone.” “why?” asked Neville_Longbottom. “because …” in his desperation to start looking for the missing horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger about where they might commence their search, Harry_Potter found it difficult to gather his thoughts. his scar was still searing. “Albus_Dumbledore left the three of us a job,” he said carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to tell — i mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.” “we’re his army,” said Neville_Longbottom. “Albus_Dumbledore’s army. we were all in it together, we’ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own —” “it hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ronald_Weasley “i never said it had, but i don’t see why you can’t trust us. everyone in this room’s been fighting and they’ve been driven in here because Alecto_Carrow and Amycus_Carrow were hunting them down. everyone in here’s proven they’re loyal to Albus_Dumbledore — loyal to you.” “look,” Harry_Potter began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter: the tunnel door had just opened behind him. “we got your message, Neville_Longbottom! hello you three, i thought you must be here!” it was Luna_Lovegood and Dean_Thomas. Seamus_Finnigan gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend. “hi, everyone!” said Luna_Lovegood happily. “oh, it’s great to be back!” “Luna_Lovegood,” said Harry_Potter distractedly, “what are you doing here? how did you — ?” “i sent for her,” said Neville_Longbottom, holding up the fake galleon. “i promised her and Ginevra_Weasley that if you turned up i’d let them know. we all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. that we were going to overthrow snape and Alecto_Carrow and Amycus_Carrow.” “of course that’s what it means,” said Luna_Lovegood brightly. “isn’t it, Harry_Potter? we’re going to fight them out of hogwarts?” “listen,” said Harry_Potter with a rising sense of panic, “i’m sorry, but that’s not what we came back for. there’s something we’ve got to do, and then —” “you’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded Michael_Corner. “no!” said Ronald_Weasley “what we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of Tom_Riddle —” “then let us help!” said Neville_Longbottom angrily. “we want to be a part of it!” there was another noise behind them, and Harry_Potter turned. his heart seemed to fail: Ginevra_Weasley was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley, and Lee_Jordan. Ginevra_Weasley gave Harry_Potter a radiant smile: he had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her. “Aberforth_Dumbledore’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred_Weasley, raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting. “he wants a kip, and his bar’s turned into a railway station.” Harry_Potter’s mouth fell open. right behind Lee_Jordan came Harry_Potter’s old girlfriend, Cho_Chang. she smiled at him. “i got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake galleon, and she walked over to sit beside Michael_Corner. “so what’s the plan, Harry_Potter?” said George_Weasley. “there isn’t one,” said Harry_Potter, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely. “just going to make it up as we go along, are we? my favorite kind,” said Fred_Weasley. “you’ve got to stop this!” Harry_Potter told Neville_Longbottom. “what did you call them all back for? this is insane —” “we’re fighting, aren’t we?” said Dean_Thomas, taking out his fake galleon. “the message said Harry_Potter was back, and we were going to fight! i’ll have to get a wand, though —” “you haven’t got a wand — ?” began Seamus_Finnigan. Ronald_Weasley turned suddenly to Harry_Potter. “why can’t they help?” “what?” “they can help.” he dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione_Granger, who stood between them, “we don’t know where it is. we’ve got to find it fast. we don’t have to tell them it’s a horcrux.” Harry_Potter looked from Ronald_Weasley to Hermione_Granger, who murmured, “i think ron’s right. we don’t even know what we’re looking for, we need them.” and when Harry_Potter looked unconvinCedric_Diggory, “you don’t have to do everything alone, Harry_Potter.” Harry_Potter thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. Albus_Dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger about the horcruxes. secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus_Dumbledore … he was a natural. … was he turning into Albus_Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? but Albus_Dumbledore had trusted snape, and where had that led? to murder at the top of the highest tower … “all right,” he said quietly to the other two. “okay,” he called to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley, who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them looked alert, excited. “there’s something we need to find,” Harry_Potter said. “something — something that’ll help us overthrow Tom_Riddle. it’s here at hogwarts, but we don’t know where. it might have belonged to ravenclaw. has anyone heard of an object like that? has anyone ever come across something with her eagle on it, for instance?” he looked Hope_Howellfully toward the little group of ravenclaws, to Padma_Patil, michael, Terry_Boot, and cho, but it was Luna_Lovegood who answered, perched on the arm of Ginevra_Weasley’s chair. “well, there’s her lost diadem. i told you about it, remember, Harry_Potter? the lost diadem of ravenclaw? daddy’s trying to duplicate it.” “yeah, but the lost diadem,” said Michael_Corner, rolling his eyes, “is lost, Luna_Lovegood. that’s sort of the point.” “when was it lost?” asked Harry_Potter. “centuries ago, they say,” said cho, and Harry_Potter’s heart sank. “professor flitwick says the diadem vanished with ravenclaw herself. people have looked, but,” she appealed to her fellow ravenclaws, “nobody’s ever found a trace of it, have they?” they all shook their heads. “sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ronald_Weasley “it’s a kind of crown,” said Terry_Boot. “ravenclaw’s was supposed to have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.” “yes, daddy’s wrackspurt siphons —” but Harry_Potter cut across Luna_Lovegood. “and none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?” they all shook their heads again. Harry_Potter looked at Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. an object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good candidate for the horcrux hidden in the castle. … before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho_Chang spoke again. “if you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to look like, i could take you up to our common room and show you, Harry_Potter? ravenclaw’s wearing it in her statue.” Harry_Potter’s scar scorched again: for a moment the room of requirement swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders. voldemort was flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he did not know: either way, there was hardly any time left. “he’s on the move,” he said quietly to Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger. he glanCedric_Diggory at Cho_Chang and then back at them. “listen, i know it’s not much of a lead, but i’m going to go and look at this statue, at least find out what the diadem looks like. wait for me here and keep, you know — the other one — safe.” Cho_Chang had got to her feet, but Ginevra_Weasley said rather fiercely, “no, Luna_Lovegood will take Harry_Potter, won’t you, Luna_Lovegood?” “oooh, yes, i’d like to,” said Luna_Lovegood happily, and Cho_Chang sat down again, looking disappointed. “how do we get out?” Harry_Potter asked Neville_Longbottom. “over here.” he led Harry_Potter and Luna_Lovegood to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase. “it comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never been able to find it,” he said. “only trouble is, we never know exactly where we’re going to end up when we go out. be careful, Harry_Potter, they’re always patrolling the corridors at night.” “no problem,” said Harry_Potter. “see you in a bit.” he and Luna_Lovegood hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned corners in unexpected places. at last they reached what appeared to be solid wall. “get under here,” Harry_Potter told Luna_Lovegood, pulling out the invisibility cloak and throwing it over both of them. he gave the wall a little push. it melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry_Potter glanCedric_Diggory back and saw that it had resealed itself at once. they were standing in a dark corridor: Harry_Potter pulled Luna_Lovegood back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the marauder’s map. holding it close to his nose he searched, and located his and Luna_Lovegood’s dots at last. “we’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching filch moving away from them, a corridor ahead. “come on, this way.” they crept off. Harry_Potter had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. through squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry_Potter and Luna_Lovegood walked, checking the marauder’s map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. he expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach. “this way, Harry_Potter,” breathed Luna_Lovegood, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase. they climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry_Potter had never been up here before. at last they reached a door. there was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. Luna_Lovegood reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, unconnected to arm or body. she knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry_Potter like a cannon blast. at once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird’s call, a soft, musical voice said, “which came first, the phoenix or the flame?” “hmm … what do you think, Harry_Potter?” said Luna_Lovegood, looking thoughtful. “what? isn’t there just a password?” “oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna_Lovegood. “what if you get it wrong?” “well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,” said Luna_Lovegood. “that way you learn, you see?” “yeah … trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna_Lovegood.” “no, i see what you mean,” said Luna_Lovegood seriously. “well then, i think the answer is that a circle has no beginning.” “well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung open. the deserted ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry_Potter had ever seen at hogwarts. graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks: by day, the ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. the ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. there were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble. Harry_Potter recognized rOwen_Cauldwella ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna_Lovegood’s house. the statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. he strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. a delicate-looking circlet had been reproduCedric_Diggory in marble on top of her head. it was not unlike the tiara Fleur_Delacour had worn at her wedding. there were tiny words etched into it. Harry_Potter stepped out from under the cloak and climbed up onto ravenclaw’s plinth to read them. “ ‘wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’ ” “which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a cackling voice. Harry_Potter whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. the sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto_Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry_Potter raised his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm.
