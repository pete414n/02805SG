epilogue nineteen years later autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. the morning of the first of september was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father’s arm. “it won’t be long, and you’ll be going too,” Harry_Potter told her. “two years,” sniffed Lily_L._Potter. “i want to go now!” the commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus_Potter’s voice drifted back to Harry_Potter over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. “i won’t! i won’t be in slytherin!” “James_Potter_II, give it a rest!” said Ginevra_Weasley. “i only said he might be,” said James_Potter_II, grinning at his younger brother. “there’s nothing wrong with that. he might be in slyth —” but James_Potter_II caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. the five potters approached the barrier. with a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James_Potter_II took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. a moment later, he had vanished. “you’ll write to me, won’t you?” Albus_Potter asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. “every day, if you want us to,” said Ginevra_Weasley. “not every day,” said Albus_Potter quickly. “James_Potter_II says most people only get letters from home about once a month.” “we wrote to James_Potter_II three times a week last year,” said Ginevra_Weasley. “and you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about hogwarts,” Harry_Potter put in. “he likes a laugh, your brother.” side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. as they reached the barrier, Albus_Potter winCedric_Diggory, but no collision came. instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet hogwarts express. indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James_Potter_II had already disappeared. “where are they?” asked Albus_Potter anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform. “we’ll find them,” said Ginevra_Weasley reassuringly. but the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody’s faces. detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry_Potter thought he heard Percy_Weasley discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. … “i think that’s them, al,” said Ginevra_Weasley suddenly. a group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. their faces only came into focus when Harry_Potter, Ginevra_Weasley, Lily_L._Potter, and Albus_Potter had drawn right up to them. “hi,” said Albus_Potter, sounding immensely relieved. Rose_Granger-Weasley, who was already wearing her brand-new hogwarts robes, beamed at him. “parked all right, then?” Ronald_Weasley asked Harry_Potter. “i did. Hermione_Granger didn’t believe i could pass a muggle driving test, did you? she thought i’d have to confund the examiner.” “no, i didn’t,” said Hermione_Granger, “i had complete faith in you.” “as a matter of fact, i did confund him,” Ronald_Weasley whispered to Harry_Potter, as together they lifted Albus_Potter’s trunk and owl onto the train. “i only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let’s face it, i can use a supersensory charm for that.” back on the platform, they found Lily_L._Potter and Hugo_Granger-Weasley, Rose_Granger-Weasley’s younger brother, having an animated discussion about which house they would be sorted into when they finally went to hogwarts. “if you’re not in gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said Ronald_Weasley “but no pressure.” “ron!” Lily_L._Potter and Hugo_Granger-Weasley laughed, but Albus_Potter and Rose_Granger-Weasley looked solemn. “he doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione_Granger and Ginevra_Weasley, but Ronald_Weasley was no longer paying attention. catching Harry_Potter’s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. the steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist. “look who it is.” Draco_Malfoy was standing there with his Astoria_Malfoy and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. his hair was reCedric_Diggorying somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. the new boy resembled Draco_Malfoy as much as Albus_Potter resembled Harry_Potter. Draco_Malfoy caught sight of Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley Hermione_Granger, and Ginevra_Weasley staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. “so that’s little ScorPius_Thicknesse_Malfoy,” said Ronald_Weasley under his breath. “make sure you beat him in every test, Rose_Granger-Weasley. thank god you inherited your mother’s brains.” “ron, for heaven’s sake,” said Hermione_Granger, half stern, half amused. “don’t try to turn them against each other before they’ve even started school!” “you’re right, sorry,” said Ronald_Weasley but unable to help himself, he added, “don’t get too friendly with him, though, Rose_Granger-Weasley. granddad weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.” “hey!” James_Potter_II had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news. “Edward_Lupin’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. “just seen him! and guess what he’s doing? snogging Victoire_Weasley!” he gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. “our Edward_Lupin! Edward_Lupin lupin! snogging our Victoire_Weasley! our cousin! and i asked Edward_Lupin what he was doing —” “you interrupted them?” said Ginevra_Weasley. “you are so like Ronald_Weasley —” “— and he said he’d come to see her off! and then he told me to go away. he’s snogging her!” James_Potter_II added as though worried he had not made himself clear. “oh, it would be lovely if they got married!” whispered Lily_L._Potter ecstatically. “Edward_Lupin would really be part of the family then!” “he already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said Harry_Potter. “why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?” “yeah!” said James_Potter_II enthusiastically. “i don’t mind sharing with Albus_Potter — Edward_Lupin could have my room!” “no,” said Harry_Potter firmly, “you and Albus_Potter will share a room only when i want the house demolished.” he checked the battered old watch that had once been fabian prewett’s. “it’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.” “don’t forget to give Neville_Longbottom our love!” Ginevra_Weasley told James_Potter_II as she hugged him. “mum! i can’t give a professor love!” “but you know Neville_Longbottom —” James_Potter_II rolled his eyes. “outside, yeah, but at school he’s professor longbottom, isn’t he? i can’t walk into herbology and give him love. …” shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus_Potter. “see you later, al. watch out for the Thestrals.” “i thought they were invisible? you said they were invisible!” but James_Potter_II merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. they saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends. “Thestrals are nothing to worry about,” Harry_Potter told Albus_Potter. “they’re gentle things, there’s nothing scary about them. anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages, you’ll be going in the boats.” Ginevra_Weasley kissed Albus_Potter good-bye. “see you at christmas.” “bye, al,” said Harry_Potter as his son hugged him. “don’t forget Rubeus_Hagrid’s invited you to tea next friday. don’t mess with Peeves. don’t duel anyone till you’ve learned how. and don’t let James_Potter_II wind you up.” “what if i’m in slytherin?” the whisper was for his father alone, and Harry_Potter knew that only the moment of departure could have forCedric_Diggory Albus_Potter to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. Harry_Potter crouched down so that Albus_Potter’s face was slightly above his own. alone of Harry_Potter’s three children, Albus_Potter had inherited Lily_L._Potter’s eyes. “Albus_Potter Severus_Snape,” Harry_Potter said quietly, so that nobody but Ginevra_Weasley could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose_Granger-Weasley, who was now on the train, “you were named for two headmasters of hogwarts. one of them was a slytherin and he was probably the bravest man i ever knew.” “but just say —” “— then slytherin house will have gained an excellent student, won’t it? it doesn’t matter to us, al. but if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose gryffindor over slytherin. the sorting hat takes your choice into account.” “really?” “it did for me,” said Harry_Potter. he had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus_Potter’s face when he said it. but now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus_Potter jumped into the carriage and Ginevra_Weasley closed the door behind him. students were hanging from the windows nearest them. a great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry_Potter. “why are they all staring?” demanded Albus_Potter as he and Rose_Granger-Weasley craned around to look at the other students. “don’t let it worry you,” said Ronald_Weasley “it’s me. i’m extremely famous.” Albus_Potter, Rose_Granger-Weasley, Hugo_Granger-Weasley, and Lily_L._Potter laughed. the train began to move, and Harry_Potter walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry_Potter kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. … the last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. the train rounded a corner. Harry_Potter’s hand was still raised in farewell. “he’ll be all right,” murmured Ginevra_Weasley. as Harry_Potter looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the Harry_Potter scar on his forehead. “i know he will.” the scar had not pained Harry_Potter for nineteen years. all was well.
