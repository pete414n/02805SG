chapter 23 malfoy manor Harry_Potter looked around at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness. he saw Hermione_Granger point her wand, not toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang, a burst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. he could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him. “get up, vermin.” unknown hands dragged Harry_Potter roughly off the ground. before he could stop them, someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry_Potter clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. his eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent; all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger outside too. “get — off — her!” Ronald_Weasley shouted. there was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: Ronald_Weasley grunted in pain and Hermione_Granger screamed, “no! leave him alone, leave him alone!” “your boyfriend’s going to have worse than that done to him if he’s on my list,” said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. “delicious girl … what a treat … i do enjoy the softness of the skin. …” Harry_Potter’s stomach turned over. he knew who this was: Fenrir_Greyback, the werewolf who was permitted to wear death eater robes in return for his hired savagery. “search the tent!” said another voice. Harry_Potter was thrown facedown onto the ground. a thud told him that Ronald_Weasley had been cast down beside him. they could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched. “now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Fenrir_Greyback’s gloating voice from overhead, and Harry_Potter was rolled over onto his back. a beam of wandlight fell into his face and Fenrir_Greyback laughed. “i’ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. what happened to you, ugly?” Harry_Potter did not answer immediately. “i said,” repeated Fenrir_Greyback, and Harry_Potter received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain, “what happened to you?” “stung,” Harry_Potter muttered. “been stung.” “yeah, looks like it,” said a second voice. “what’s your name?” snarled Fenrir_Greyback. “Dudley_Dursley,” said Harry_Potter. “and your first name?” “i — Vernon_Dursley. Vernon_Dursley Dudley_Dursley.” “check the list, Scabior,” said Fenrir_Greyback, and Harry_Potter heard him move sideways to look down at Ronald_Weasley instead. “and what about you, ginger?” “stan shunpike,” said Ronald_Weasley “like ’ell you are,” said the man called Scabior. “we know Stanley_Shunpike shunpike, ’e’s put a bit of work our way.” there was another thud. “i’b bardy,” said Ronald_Weasley and Harry_Potter could tell that his mouth was full of blood. “bardy weadley.” “a weasley?” rasped Fenrir_Greyback. “so you’re related to blood traitors even if you’re not a mudblood. and lastly, your pretty little friend …” the relish in his voice made Harry_Potter’s flesh crawl. “easy, Fenrir_Greyback,” said Scabior over the jeering of the others. “oh, i’m not going to bite just yet. we’ll see if she’s a bit quicker at remembering her name than barny. who are you, girly?” “Penelope_Clearwater,” said Hermione_Granger. she sounded terrified, but convincing. “what’s your blood status?” “half-blood,” said Hermione_Granger. “easy enough to check,” said Scabior. “but the ’ole lot of ’em look like they could still be ’ogwarts age —” “we’b lebt,” said Ronald_Weasley “left, ’ave you, ginger?” said Scabior. “and you decided to go camping? and you thought, just for a laugh, you’d use the dark lord’s name?” “nod a laugh,” said Ronald_Weasley “aggiden.” “accident?” there was more jeering laughter. “you know who used to like using the dark lord’s name, weasley?” growled Fenrir_Greyback. “the order of the phoenix. mean anything to you?” “doh.” “well, they don’t show the dark lord proper respect, so the name’s been tabooed. a few order members have been tracked that way. we’ll see. bind them up with the other two prisoners!” someone yanked Harry_Potter up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed him down into a sitting position, then started binding him back-to-back with other people. Harry_Potter was still half blind, barely able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. when at last the man tying them had walked away, Harry_Potter whispered to the other prisoners. “anyone still got a wand?” “no,” said Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger from either side of him. “this is all my fault. i said the name, i’m sorry —” “Harry_Potter?” it was a new, but familiar, voice, and it came from directly behind Harry_Potter, from the person tied to Hermione_Granger’s left. “Dean_Thomas?” “it is you! if they find out who they’ve got — ! they’re snatchers, they’re only looking for truants to sell for gold —” “not a bad little haul for one night,” Fenrir_Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by Harry_Potter and they heard more crashes from inside the tent. “a mudblood, a runaway goblin, and three truants. you checked their names on the list yet, Scabior?” he roared. “yeah. there’s no Vernon_Dursley Dudley_Dursley on ’ere, Fenrir_Greyback.” “interesting,” said Fenrir_Greyback. “that’s interesting.” he crouched down beside Harry_Potter, who saw, through the infinitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers, with pointed brown teeth and sores at the corners of his mouth. Fenrir_Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where Albus_Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood. “so you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon_Dursley? or are you on that list under a different name? what house were you in at hogwarts?” “slytherin,” said Harry_Potter automatically. “funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that,” jeered Scabior out of the shadows. “but none of ’em can tell us where the common room is.” “it’s in the Mundungus_Fletchereons,” said Harry_Potter clearly. “you enter through the wall. it’s full of skulls and stuff and it’s under the lake, so the light’s all green.” there was a short pause. “well, well, looks like we really ’ave caught a little slytherin,” said Scabior. “good for you, Vernon_Dursley, ’cause there ain’t a lot of mudblood slytherins. who’s your father?” “he works at the ministry,” Harry_Potter lied. he knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case. “department of magical accidents and catastrophes.” “you know what, Fenrir_Greyback,” said Scabior. “i think there is a Dudley_Dursley in there.” Harry_Potter could barely breathe: could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this? “well, well,” said Fenrir_Greyback, and Harry_Potter could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Fenrir_Greyback was wondering whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a ministry official. Harry_Potter’s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know that Fenrir_Greyback could see it. “if you’re telling the truth, ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the ministry. i expect your father’ll reward us just for picking you up.” “but,” said Harry_Potter, his mouth bone dry, “if you just let us —” “hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “look at this, Fenrir_Greyback!” a dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry_Potter saw a glint of silver in the light of their wands. they had found gryffindor’s sword. “ve-e-ry nice,” said Fenrir_Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion. “oh, very nice indeed. looks goblin-made, that. where did you get something like this?” “it’s my father’s,” Harry_Potter lied, hoping against Hope_Howell that it was too dark for Fenrir_Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. “we borrowed it to cut firewood —” “ ’ang on a minute, Fenrir_Greyback! look at this, in the prophet!” as Scabior said it, Harry_Potter’s scar, which was stretched tight across his distended forehead, burned savagely. more clearly than he could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress, jet-black and forbidding; voldemort’s thoughts had suddenly become razor-sharp again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose. … so close … so close … with a huge effort of will Harry_Potter closed his mind to voldemort’s thoughts, pulling himself back to where he sat, tied to Ronald_Weasley Hermione_Granger, Dean_Thomas, and Griphook in the darkness, listening to Fenrir_Greyback and Scabior. “ ‘’ermione granger,’ ” Scabior was saying, “ ‘the mudblood who is known to be traveling with ’arry potter.’ ” Harry_Potter’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present, not to slip into voldemort’s mind. he heard the creak of Fenrir_Greyback’s boots as he crouched down in front of Hermione_Granger. “you know what, little girly? this picture looks a hell of a lot like you.” “it isn’t! it isn’t me!” Hermione_Granger’s terrified squeak was as good as a confession. “ ‘… known to be traveling with Harry_Potter,’ ” repeated Fenrir_Greyback quietly. a stillness had settled over the scene. Harry_Potter’s scar was exquisitely painful, but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of voldemort’s thoughts: it had never been so important to remain in his own right mind. “well, this changes things, doesn’t it?” whispered Fenrir_Greyback. nobody spoke: Harry_Potter sensed the gang of snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione_Granger’s arm trembling against his. Fenrir_Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where Harry_Potter sat, crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features. “what’s that on your forehead, Vernon_Dursley?” he asked softly, his breath foul in Harry_Potter’s nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar. “don’t touch it!” Harry_Potter yelled; he could not stop himself; he thought he might be sick from the pain of it. “i thought you wore glasses, potter?” breathed Fenrir_Greyback. “i found glasses!” yelped one of the snatchers skulking in the background. “there was glasses in the tent, Fenrir_Greyback, wait —” and seconds later Harry_Potter’s glasses had been rammed back onto his face. the snatchers were closing in now, peering at him. “it is!” rasped Fenrir_Greyback. “we’ve caught potter!” they all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. Harry_Potter, still fighting to remain present inside his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say: fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind — — he was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress — no, he was Harry_Potter, tied up and wandless, in grave danger — — looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower — he was Harry_Potter, and they were discussing his fate in low voices — —  time to fly … “… to the ministry?” “to hell with the ministry,” growled Fenrir_Greyback. “they’ll take the credit, and we won’t get a look in. i say we take him straight to Tom_Riddle.” “will you summon ’im? ’ere?” said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified. “no,” snarled Fenrir_Greyback, “i haven’t got — they say he’s using the malfoys’ place as a base. we’ll take the boy there.” Harry_Potter thought he knew why Fenrir_Greyback was not calling voldemort. the werewolf might be allowed to wear death eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only voldemort’s inner circle were branded with the dark mark: Fenrir_Greyback had not been granted this highest honor. Harry_Potter’s scar seared again — — and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the window at the very top of the tower — “… completely sure it’s him? ’cause if it ain’t, Fenrir_Greyback, we’re dead.” “who’s in charge here?” roared Fenrir_Greyback, covering his moment of inadequacy. “i say that’s potter, and him plus his wand, that’s two hundred thousand galleons right there! but if you’re too gutless to come along, any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, i’ll get the girl thrown in!” — the window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough for a man to enter. … a skeletal figure was just visible through it, curled beneath a blanket. … dead, or sleeping … ? “all right!” said Scabior. “all right, we’re in! and what about the rest of ’em, Fenrir_Greyback, what’ll we do with ’em?” “might as well take the lot. we’ve got two mudbloods, that’s another ten galleons. give me the sword as well. if they’re rubies, that’s another small fortune right there.” the prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry_Potter could hear Hermione_Granger’s breathing, fast and terrified. “grab hold and make it tight. i’ll do potter!” said Fenrir_Greyback, seizing a fistful of Harry_Potter’s hair; Harry_Potter could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. “on three! one — two — three —” they disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry_Potter struggled, trying to throw off Fenrir_Greyback’s hand, but it was Hope_Howellless: Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger were squeezed tightly against him on either side, he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still — — as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor, inside the cell-like room — the prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. Harry_Potter’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive. he experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. the worst had not happened yet: voldemort was not here. he was, Harry_Potter knew, for he was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. how long it would take voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that Harry_Potter was here, was another matter. … one of the snatchers strode to the gates and shook them. “how do we get in? they’re locked, Fenrir_Greyback, i can’t — blimey!” he whipped his hands away in fright. the iron was contorting, twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing voice: “state your purpose!” “we’ve got potter!” Fenrir_Greyback roared triumphantly. “we’ve captured Harry_Potter!” the gates swung open. “come on!” said Fenrir_Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive, between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. Harry_Potter saw a ghostly white shape above him, and realized it was an albino peacock. he stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by Fenrir_Greyback; now he was staggering along sideways, tied back-to-back to the four other prisoners. closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what voldemort was doing, whether he knew yet that Harry_Potter was caught. … the emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, eyes opening in a skull of a face. … the frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon him, upon voldemort, and then he smiled. most of his teeth were gone. … “so, you have come. i thought you would … one day. but your journey was pointless. i never had it.” “you lie!” as voldemort’s anger throbbed inside him, Harry_Potter’s scar threatened to burst with pain, and he wrenched his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel. light spilled out over all of them. “what is this?” said a woman’s cold voice. “we’re here to see he-who-must-not-be-named!” rasped Fenrir_Greyback. “who are you?” “you know me!” there was resentment in the werewolf’s voice. “Fenrir_Greyback! we’ve caught Harry_Potter!” Fenrir_Greyback seized Harry_Potter and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too. “i know ’e’s swollen, ma’am, but it’s ’im!” piped up Scabior. “if you look a bit closer, you’ll see ’is scar. and this ’ere, see the girl? the mudblood who’s been traveling around with ’im, ma’am. there’s no doubt it’s ’im, and we’ve got ’is wand as well! ’ere, ma’am —” through his puffy eyelids Harry_Potter saw Narcissa_Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. she raised her eyebrows. “bring them in,” she said. Harry_Potter and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits. “follow me,” said Narcissa_Malfoy, leading the way across the hall. “my son, Draco_Malfoy, is home for his easter holidays. if that is Harry_Potter, he will know.” the drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost closed Harry_Potter could make out the wide proportions of the room. a crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more portraits against the dark purple walls. two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the snatchers. “what is this?” the dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius_Malfoy fell on Harry_Potter’s ears. he was paNicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoning now: he could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out voldemort’s thoughts, though his scar was still burning. “they say they’ve got potter,” said Narcissa_Malfoy’s cold voice. “Draco_Malfoy, come here.” Harry_Potter did not dare look directly at Draco_Malfoy, but saw him obliquely: a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair. Fenrir_Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry_Potter directly beneath the chandelier. “well, boy?” rasped the werewolf. Harry_Potter was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled frame. through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving grimmauld place. his face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione_Granger’s jinx. his black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. had he not known that it was he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses. he resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco_Malfoy as the latter approached. “well, Draco_Malfoy?” said Lucius_Malfoy. he sounded avid. “is it? is it Harry_Potter?” “i can’t — i can’t be sure,” said Draco_Malfoy. he was keeping his distance from Fenrir_Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry_Potter as Harry_Potter was of looking at him. “but look at him carefully, look! come closer!” Harry_Potter had never heard Lucius_Malfoy so excited. “Draco_Malfoy, if we are the ones who hand potter over to the dark lord, everything will be forgiv —” “now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, i Hope_Howell, mr. malfoy?” said Fenrir_Greyback menacingly. “of course not, of course not!” said Lucius_Malfoy impatiently. he approached Harry_Potter himself, came so close that Harry_Potter could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes. with his face a puffy mask, Harry_Potter felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage. “what did you do to him?” Lucius_Malfoy asked Fenrir_Greyback. “how did he get into this state?” “that wasn’t us.” “looks more like a stinging jinx to me,” said Lucius_Malfoy. his gray eyes raked Harry_Potter’s forehead. “there’s something there,” he whispered, “it could be the scar, stretched tight. … Draco_Malfoy, come here, look properly! what do you think?” Harry_Potter saw Draco_Malfoy’s face up close now, right beside his father’s. they were extraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, Draco_Malfoy’s expression was full of reluctance, even fear. “i don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching. “we had better be certain, Lucius_Malfoy,” Narcissa_Malfoy called to her husband in her cold, clear voice. “completely sure that it is potter, before we summon the dark lord … they say this is his” — she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand — “but it does not resemble Garrick_Ollivander’s description. … if we are mistaken, if we call the dark lord here for nothing … remember what he did to rowle and dolohov?” “what about the mudblood, then?” growled Fenrir_Greyback. Harry_Potter was nearly thrown off his feet as the snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light fell on Hermione_Granger instead. “wait,” said Narcissa_Malfoy sharply. “yes — yes, she was in madam Malkin’s with potter! i saw her picture in the prophet! look, Draco_Malfoy, isn’t it the granger girl?” “i … maybe … yeah.” “but then, that’s the weasley boy!” shouted Lucius_Malfoy, striding around the bound prisoners to face Ronald_Weasley “it’s them, potter’s friends — Draco_Malfoy, look at him, isn’t it Arthur_Weasley’s son, what’s his name — ?” “yeah,” said Draco_Malfoy again, his back to the prisoners. “it could be.” the drawing room door opened behind Harry_Potter. a woman spoke, and the sound of the voice wound Harry_Potter’s fear to an even higher pitch. “what is this? what’s happened, Narcissa_Malfoy?” Bellatrix_Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry_Potter’s right, staring at Hermione_Granger through her heavily lidded eyes. “but surely,” she said quietly, “this is the mudblood girl? this is granger?” “yes, yes, it’s granger!” cried Lucius_Malfoy. “and beside her, we think, potter! potter and his friends, caught at last!” “potter?” shrieked Bellatrix_Lestrange, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry_Potter. “are you sure? well then, the dark lord must be informed at once!” she dragged back her left sleeve: Harry_Potter saw the dark mark burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her beloved master — “i was about to call him!” said Lucius_Malfoy, and his hand actually closed upon Bellatrix_Lestrange’s wrist, preventing her from touching the mark. “i shall summon him, Bellatrix_Lestrange, potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my authority —” “your authority!” she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. “you lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius_Malfoy! how dare you! take your hands off me!” “this is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy —” “begging your pardon, mr. malfoy,” interjected Fenrir_Greyback, “but it’s us that caught potter, and it’s us that’ll be claiming the gold —” “gold!” laughed Bellatrix_Lestrange, still attempting to throw off her brother-in- law, her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand. “take your gold, filthy scavenger, what do i want with gold? i seek only the honor of his — of —” she stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something Harry_Potter could not see. jubilant at her capitulation, Lucius_Malfoy threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve — “stop!” shrieked Bellatrix_Lestrange. “do not touch it, we shall all perish if the dark lord comes now!” Lucius_Malfoy froze, his index finger hovering over his own mark. Bellatrix_Lestrange strode out of Harry_Potter’s limited line of vision. “what is that?” he heard her say. “sword,” grunted an out-of-sight snatcher. “give it to me.” “it’s not yorn, missus, it’s mine, i reckon i found it.” there was a bang and a flash of red light: Harry_Potter knew that the snatcher had been stunned. there was a roar of anger from his fellows: Scabior drew his wand. “what d’you think you’re playing at, woman?” “stupefy!” she screamed. “stupefy!” they were no match for her, even though there were four of them against one of her: she was a witch, as Harry_Potter knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience. they fell where they stood, all except Fenrir_Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms outstretched. out of the corners of his eyes Harry_Potter saw Bellatrix_Lestrange bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen. “where did you get this sword?” she whispered to Fenrir_Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip. “how dare you?” he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her. he bared his pointed teeth. “release me, woman!” “where did you find this sword?” she repeated, brandishing it in his face. “snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts_Head_Goblin!” “it was in their tent,” rasped Fenrir_Greyback. “release me, i say!” she waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary to approach her. he prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved nails clutching its back. “Draco_Malfoy, move  the unconscious men. “if you haven’t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.” this scum outside,” said Bellatrix_Lestrange,  indicating  “don’t you dare speak to Draco_Malfoy like —” said Narcissa_Malfoy furiously, but Bellatrix_Lestrange screamed, “be quiet! the situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Narcissa_Malfoy! we have a very serious problem!” she stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. then she turned to look at the silent prisoners. “if it is indeed potter, he must not be harmed,” she muttered, more to herself than to the others. “the dark lord wishes to dispose of potter himself. … but if he finds out … i must … i must know. …” she turned back to her sister again. “the prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while i think what to do!” “this is my house, Bellatrix_Lestrange, you don’t give orders in my —” “do it! you have no idea of the danger we are in!” shrieked Bellatrix_Lestrange. she looked frightening, mad; a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet. Narcissa_Malfoy hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf. “take these prisoners down to the cellar, Fenrir_Greyback.” “wait,” said Bellatrix_Lestrange sharply. “all except … except for the mudblood.” Fenrir_Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure. “no!” shouted Ronald_Weasley “you can have me, keep me!” Bellatrix_Lestrange hit him across the face; the blow echoed around the room. “if she dies under questioning, i’ll take you next,” she said. “blood traitor is next to mudblood in my book. take them downstairs, Fenrir_Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more to them — yet.” she threw Fenrir_Greyback’s wand back to him, then took a short silver knife from under her robes. she cut Hermione_Granger free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room, while Fenrir_Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door, into a dark passageway, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force. “reckon she’ll let me have a bit of the girl when she’s finished with her?” Fenrir_Greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor. “i’d say i’ll get a bite or two, wouldn’t you, ginger?” Harry_Potter could feel Ronald_Weasley shaking. they were forced down a steep flight of stairs, still tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. at the bottom was a heavy door. Fenrir_Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness. the echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible, drawn-out scream from directly above them. “Hermione_Granger!” Ronald_Weasley bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle that Harry_Potter staggered. together, so  the ropes  tying  them  against “Hermione_Granger!” “be quiet!” Harry_Potter said. “shut up, Ronald_Weasley we need to work out a way —” “Hermione_Granger! Hermione_Granger!” “we need a plan, stop yelling — we need to get these ropes off —” “Harry_Potter?” came a whisper through the darkness. “ron? is that you?” Ronald_Weasley stopped shouting. there was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry_Potter saw a shadow moving closer. “Harry_Potter? Ronald_Weasley” “Luna_Lovegood?” “yes, it’s me! oh no, i didn’t want you to be caught!” “Luna_Lovegood, can you help us get these ropes off?” said Harry_Potter. “oh yes, i expect so. … there’s an old nail we use if we need to break anything. … just a moment …” Hermione_Granger screamed again from overhead, and they could hear Bellatrix_Lestrange screaming too, but her words were inaudible, for Ronald_Weasley shouted again, “Hermione_Granger! Hermione_Granger!” “Garrick_Ollivander?” Harry_Potter could hear Luna_Lovegood saying. “Garrick_Ollivander, have you got the nail? if you just move over a little bit… i think it was beside the water jug. …” she was back within seconds. “you’ll need to stay still,” she said. Harry_Potter could feel her digging at the rope’s tough fibers to work the knots free. from upstairs they heard Bellatrix_Lestrange’s voice. “i’m going to ask you again! where did you get this sword? where?” “we found it — we found it — please!” Hermione_Granger screamed again; Ronald_Weasley struggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry_Potter’s wrist. “ron, please stay still!” Luna_Lovegood whispered. “i can’t see what i’m doing —” “my pocket!” said Ronald_Weasley “in my pocket, there’s a deluminator, and it’s full of light!” a few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar: unable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung there, like tiny suns, flooding the underground room with light. Harry_Potter saw Luna_Lovegood, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless figure of Garrick_Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the corner. craning around, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners: Dean_Thomas and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans. “oh, that’s much easier, thanks, Ronald_Weasley” said Luna_Lovegood, and she began hacking at their bindings again. “hello, Dean_Thomas!” from above came Bellatrix_Lestrange’s voice. “you are lying, filthy mudblood, and i know it! you have been inside my vault at Gringotts_Head_Goblin! tell the truth, tell the truth!” another terrible scream — “Hermione_Granger!” “what else did you take? what else have you got? tell me the truth or, i swear, i shall run you through with this knife!” “there!” Harry_Potter felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ronald_Weasley running around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor. Dean_Thomas, his face bruised and Bloody_Baron, said “thanks” to Luna_Lovegood and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank onto the cellar floor, looking groggy and disoriented, many welts across his swarthy face. Ronald_Weasley was now trying to disapparate without a wand. “there’s no way out, Ronald_Weasley” said Luna_Lovegood, watching his fruitless efforts. “the cellar is completely escape-proof. i tried, at first. Garrick_Ollivander has been here for a long time, he’s tried everything.” Hermione_Granger was screaming again: the sound went through Harry_Potter like physical pain. barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless. “what else did you take, what else? answer me! crucio!” Hermione_Granger’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ronald_Weasley was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists, and Harry_Potter in utter desperation seized Rubeus_Hagrid’s pouch from around his neck and groped inside it: he pulled out Albus_Dumbledore’s snitch and shook it, hoping for he did not know what — nothing happened — he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they were lifeless — the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of brightest blue — Albus_Dumbledore’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. “help us!” he yelled at it in mad desperation. “we’re in the cellar of malfoy manor, help us!” the eye blinked and was gone. Harry_Potter was not even sure that it had really been there. he tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs Hermione_Granger was screaming worse to him Ronald_Weasley was bellowing, “Hermione_Granger! than ever, and next Hermione_Granger!” “how did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix_Lestrange scream. “did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?” “we only met him tonight!” Hermione_Granger sobbed. “we’ve never been inside your vault. … it isn’t the real sword! it’s a copy, just a copy! “a copy?” screeched Bellatrix_Lestrange. “oh, a likely story!” “but we can find out easily!” came Lucius_Malfoy’s voice. “Draco_Malfoy, fetch the goblin, he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!” Harry_Potter dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor. “Griphook,” he whispered into the goblin’s pointed ear, “you must tell them that sword’s a fake, they mustn’t know it’s the real one, Griphook, please —” he could hear someone scuttling down the cellar steps; next moment, Draco_Malfoy’s shaking voice spoke from behind the door. “stand back. line up against the back wall. don’t try anything, or i’ll kill you!” they did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ronald_Weasley clicked the deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar’s darkness. the door flew open; malfoy marched inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. he seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. the door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar. Ronald_Weasley clicked the deluminator. three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just apparated into their midst. “dob — !” Harry_Potter hit Ronald_Weasley on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ronald_Weasley looked terrified at his mistake. footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco_Malfoy marching Griphook to Bellatrix_Lestrange. Dobby’s enormous, tennis-ball-shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears. he was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petrified. “Harry_Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, “Dobby has come to rescue you.” “but how did you — ?” an awful scream drowned Harry_Potter’s words: Hermione_Granger was being tortured again. he cut to the essentials. “you can disapparate out of this cellar?” he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears flapping. “and you can take humans with you?” Dobby nodded again. “right. Dobby, i want you to grab Luna_Lovegood, Dean_Thomas, and Garrick_Ollivander, and take them — take them to —” “bill and Fleur_Delacour’s,” said Ronald_Weasley “shell cottage on the outskirts of tinworth!” the Winky nodded for a third time. “and then come back,” said Harry_Potter. “can you do that, Dobby?” “of course, Harry_Potter,” whispered the little elf. he hurried over to Garrick_Ollivander, who appeared to be barely conscious. he took one of the wandmaker’s hands in his own, then held out the other to Luna_Lovegood and Dean_Thomas, neither of whom moved. “Harry_Potter, we want to help you!” Luna_Lovegood whispered. “we can’t leave you here,” said Dean_Thomas. “go, both of you! we’ll see you at William_Weasley and Fleur_Delacour’s.” as Harry_Potter spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds he looked down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully. “kill me, then, voldemort, i welcome death! but my death will not bring you what you seek. … there is so much you do not understand. …” he felt voldemort’s fury, but as Hermione_Granger screamed again he shut it out, returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present. “go!” Harry_Potter beseeched Luna_Lovegood and Dean_Thomas. “go! we’ll follow, just go!” they caught hold of the elf’s outstretched fingers. there was another loud crack, and Dobby, Luna_Lovegood, Dean_Thomas, and Garrick_Ollivander vanished. “what was that?” shouted Lucius_Malfoy from over their heads. “did you hear that? what was that noise in the cellar?” Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley stared at each other. “Draco_Malfoy — no, call Peter_Pettigrew! make him go and check!” footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry_Potter knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar. “we’re going to have to try and tackle him,” he whispered to Ronald_Weasley they had no choice: the moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. “leave the lights on,” Harry_Potter added, and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it. “stand back,” came Peter_Pettigrew’s voice. “stand away from the door. i am coming in.” the door flew open. for a split second Peter_Pettigrew gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair. then Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley launched themselves upon him. Ronald_Weasley seized Peter_Pettigrew’s wand arm and forced it upward; Harry_Potter slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling his voice. silently they struggled: Peter_Pettigrew’s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harry_Potter’s throat. “what is it, Peter_Pettigrew?” called Lucius_Malfoy from above. “nothing!” Ronald_Weasley called back, in a passable imitation of Peter_Pettigrew’s wheezy voice. “all fine!” Harry_Potter could barely breathe. “you’re going to kill me?” Harry_Potter choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. “after i saved your life? you owe me, Peter_Pettigrew!” the silver fingers slackened. Harry_Potter had not expected it: he wrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Peter_Pettigrew’s mouth. he saw the ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: he seemed just as shocked as Harry_Potter at what his hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness. “and we’ll have that,” whispered Ronald_Weasley tugging Peter_Pettigrew’s wand from his other hand. wandless, helpless, pettigrew’s pupils dilated in terror. his eyes had slid from Harry_Potter’s face to something else. his own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat. “no —” without pausing to think, Harry_Potter tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. the silver tool that voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes. “no!” Ronald_Weasley had released Peter_Pettigrew too, and together he and Harry_Potter tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Peter_Pettigrew’s throat, but it was no use. pettigrew was turning blue. “relashio!” said Ronald_Weasley pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione_Granger gave a dreadful scream from overhead. Peter_Pettigrew’s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and was still. Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley looked at each other, then leaving Peter_Pettigrew’s body on the floor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room. cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, which was ajar. now they had a clear view of Bellatrix_Lestrange looking down at Griphook, who was holding gryffindor’s sword in his long-fingered hands. Hermione_Granger was lying at Bellatrix_Lestrange’s feet. she was barely stirring. “well?” Bellatrix_Lestrange said to Griphook. “is it the true sword?” Harry_Potter waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar. “no,” said Griphook. “it is a fake.” “are you sure?” panted Bellatrix_Lestrange. “quite sure?” “yes,” said the goblin. relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it. “good,” she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblin’s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. she kicked him aside. “and now,” she said in a voice that burst with triumph, “we call the dark lord!” and she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the dark mark. at once, Harry_Potter’s scar felt as though it had split open again. his true surroundings vanished: he was voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he felt — he had warned them, he had told them to summon him for nothing less than potter. if they were mistaken … “kill me, then!” demanded the old man. “you will not win, you cannot win! that wand will never, ever be yours —” and voldemort’s fury broke: a burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and voldemort returned to the window, his wrath barely controllable. … they would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back. … “and i think,” said Bellatrix_Lestrange’s voice, “we can dispose of the mudblood. Fenrir_Greyback, take her if you want her.” “noooooooooooo!” Ronald_Weasley had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix_Lestrange looked around, shocked; she turned her wand to face Ronald_Weasley instead — “expelliarmus!” he roared, pointing Peter_Pettigrew’s wand at Bellatrix_Lestrange, and hers flew into the air and was caught by Harry_Potter, who had sprinted after Ronald_Weasley Lucius_Malfoy, Narcissa_Malfoy, Draco_Malfoy, and Fenrir_Greyback wheeled about; Harry_Potter yelled, “stupefy!” and Lucius_Malfoy collapsed onto the hearth. jets of light flew from Draco_Malfoy’s, Narcissa_Malfoy’s, and Fenrir_Greyback’s wands; Harry_Potter threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them. “stop or she dies!” panting, Harry_Potter peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix_Lestrange was supporting Hermione_Granger, who seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to Hermione_Granger’s throat. “drop your wands,” she whispered. “drop them, or we’ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!” Ronald_Weasley stood rigid, clutching Peter_Pettigrew’s wand. Harry_Potter straightened up, still holding Bellatrix_Lestrange’s. “i said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione_Granger’s throat: Harry_Potter saw beads of blood appear there. “all right!” he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix_Lestrange’s wand onto the floor at his feet. Ronald_Weasley did the same with Peter_Pettigrew’s. both raised their hands to shoulder height. “good!” she leered. “Draco_Malfoy, pick them up! the dark lord is coming, Harry_Potter! your death approaches!” Harry_Potter knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel voldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to apparate to them, and Harry_Potter could see no way out. “now,” said Bellatrix_Lestrange softly, as Draco_Malfoy hurried back to her with the wands, “Narcissa_Malfoy, i think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Fenrir_Greyback takes care of miss mudblood. i am sure the dark lord will not begrudge you the girl, Fenrir_Greyback, after what you have done tonight.” at the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. all of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix_Lestrange was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione_Granger, she threw herself aside with a scream. the chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione_Granger and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of gryffindor. glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions: Draco_Malfoy doubled over, his hands covering his Bloody_Baron face. as Ronald_Weasley ran to pull Hermione_Granger out of the wreckage, Harry_Potter took his chance: he leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco_Malfoy’s grip, pointed all of them at Fenrir_Greyback, and yelled, “stupefy!” the werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground. as Narcissa_Malfoy dragged Draco_Malfoy out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix_Lestrange sprang to her feet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa_Malfoy had directed her wand at the doorway. “Dobby!” she screamed, and even Bellatrix_Lestrange froze. “you! you dropped the chandelier — ?” the tiny Winky trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. “you must not hurt Harry_Potter,” he squeaked. “kill him, Narcissa_Malfoy!” shrieked Bellatrix_Lestrange, but there was another loud crack, and Narcissa_Malfoy’s wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. “you dirty little monkey!” bawled Bellatrix_Lestrange. “how dare you take a witch’s wand, how dare you defy your masters?” “Dobby has no master!” squealed the elf. “Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry_Potter and his friends!” Harry_Potter’s scar was blinding him with pain. dimly he knew that they had moments, seconds before voldemort was with them. “ron, catch — and go!” he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry_Potter seized Dobby’s hand and spun on the spot to disapparate. as he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa_Malfoy and Draco_Malfoy, of the streak of red that was ron’s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix_Lestrange’s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing — William_Weasley and Fleur_Delacour’s … shell cottage … William_Weasley and Fleur_Delacour’s … he had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and Hope_Howell that it would suffice to take him there. the pain in his forehead pierced him, and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of gryffindor’s sword bumping against his back; Dobby’s hand jerked in his; he wondered whether the Winky was trying to take charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with him. … and then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry_Potter fell to his knees, relinquished Dobby’s hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground. “are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. Harry_Potter squinted around through the darkness. there seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it. “Dobby, is this shell cottage?” he whispered, clutching the two wands he had brought from the malfoys’, ready to fight if he needed to. “have we come to the right place? Dobby?” he looked around. the little Winky stood feet from him. “Dobby!” the Winky swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. together, he and Harry_Potter looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf’s heaving chest. “Dobby — no — help!” Harry_Potter bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. “help!” he did not know or care whether they were wizards or muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry_Potter with a look of supplication. Harry_Potter caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass. “Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die —” the elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. “Harry_Potter … potter …” and then with a little shudder the Winky became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.
