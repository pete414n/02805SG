chapter 3 Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley departing the sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice yelled, “oi! you!” sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry_Potter in no doubt whom his uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. he was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for a split second, he had thought he saw Albus_Dumbledore’s eye. it was not until his uncle bellowed, “boy!” that Harry_Potter got slowly to his feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him. “you took your time!” roared Vernon_Dursley when Harry_Potter appeared at the top of the stairs. “get down here, i want a word!” Harry_Potter strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets. when he reached the living room he found all three dursleys. they were dressed for traveling: uncle Vernon_Dursley in a fawn zip-up Jack_Sloperet, aunt Petunia_Dursley in a neat salmon-colored coat, and Dudley_Dursley, Harry_Potter’s large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather Jack_Sloperet. “yes?” asked Harry_Potter. “sit down!” said uncle Vernon_Dursley. Harry_Potter raised his eyebrows. “please!” added uncle Vernon_Dursley, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat. Harry_Potter sat. he thought he knew what was coming. his uncle began to pace up and down, aunt Petunia_Dursley and Dudley_Dursley following his movements with anxious expressions. finally, his large purple face crumpled with concentration, uncle Vernon_Dursley stopped in front of Harry_Potter and spoke. “i’ve changed my mind,” he said. “what a surprise,” said Harry_Potter. “don’t you take that tone —” began aunt Petunia_Dursley in a shrill voice, but Vernon_Dursley waved her down. “it’s all a lot of claptrap,” said uncle Vernon_Dursley, glaring at Harry_Potter with piggy little eyes. “i’ve decided i don’t believe a word of it. we’re staying put, we’re not going anywhere.” Harry_Potter looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. Vernon_Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry_Potter’s favorite moment had been the one when uncle Vernon_Dursley, unaware that Dudley_Dursley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing. “according to you,” Vernon_Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and down the living room, “we — Petunia_Dursley, Dudley_Dursley, and i — are in danger. from — from —” “some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry_Potter. “well, i don’t believe it,” repeated uncle Vernon_Dursley, coming to a halt in front of Harry_Potter again. “i was awake half the night thinking it all over, and i believe it’s a plot to get the house.” “the house?” repeated Harry_Potter. “what house?” “this house!” shrieked uncle Vernon_Dursley, the vein in his forehead starting to pulse. “our house! house prices are skyrocketing around here! you want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and —” “are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry_Potter. “a plot to get this house? are you actually as stupid as you look?” “don’t you dare — !” squealed aunt Petunia_Dursley, but again, Vernon_Dursley waved her down: slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the danger he had spotted. “just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry_Potter, “i’ve already got a house, my godfather left me one. so why would i want this one? all the happy memories?” there was silence. Harry_Potter thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument. “you claim,” said uncle Vernon_Dursley, starting to pace yet again, “that this lord thing —” “— voldemort,” said Harry_Potter impatiently, “and we’ve been through this about a hundred times already. this isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Albus_Dumbledore told you last year, and Kingsley_Shacklebolt and mr. weasley —” Vernon_Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry_Potter guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry_Potter’s summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. the arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley_Shacklebolt and Arthur_Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley. Harry_Potter had to admit, however, that as mr. weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight uncle Vernon_Dursley. “— Kingsley_Shacklebolt and mr. weasley explained it all as well,” Harry_Potter pressed on remorselessly. “once i’m seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. the order is sure voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where i am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage i’d come and try to rescue you.” uncle Vernon_Dursley’s and Harry_Potter’s eyes met. Harry_Potter was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing. then uncle Vernon_Dursley walked on and Harry_Potter resumed, “you’ve got to go into hiding and the order wants to help. you’re being offered serious protection, the best there is.” uncle Vernon_Dursley said nothing, but continued to pace up and down. outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges. the next-door neighbor’s lawn mower stalled again. “i thought there was a ministry of magic?” asked Vernon_Dursley abruptly. “there is,” said Harry_Potter, surprised. “well, then, why can’t they protect us? it seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government protection!” Harry_Potter laughed; he could not help himself. it was so very typical of his uncle to put his Hope_Howells in the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted. “you heard what mr. weasley and Kingsley_Shacklebolt said,” Harry_Potter replied. “we think the ministry has been infiltrated.” uncle Vernon_Dursley strode to the fireplace and back, breathing so heavily that his great black mustache rippled, his face still purple with concentration. “all right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry_Potter yet again. “all right, let’s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection. i still don’t see why we can’t have that Kingsley_Shacklebolt bloke.” Harry_Potter managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. this question had also been addressed half a dozen times. “as i’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth, “Kingsley_Shacklebolt is protecting the mug — i mean, your prime minister.” “exactly — he’s the best!” said uncle Vernon_Dursley, pointing at the blank television screen. Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley had spotted Kingsley_Shacklebolt on the news, walking along discreetly behind the muggle prime minister as he visited a hospital. this, and the fact that Kingsley_Shacklebolt had mastered the knack of dressing like a muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley to take to Kingsley_Shacklebolt in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with his earring in. “well, he’s taken,” said Harry_Potter. “but Hestia_Jones and Dedalus_Diggle are more than up to the job —” “if we’d even seen cvs …” began uncle Vernon_Dursley, but Harry_Potter lost patience. getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the tv set himself. “these accidents aren’t accidents — the crashes and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news. people are disappearing and dying and he’s behind it — voldemort. i’ve told you this over and over again, he kills muggles for fun. even the fogs — they’re caused by dementors, and if you can’t remember what they are, ask your son!” Dudley_Dursley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. with his parents’ and Harry_Potter’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, “there are … more of them?” “more?” laughed Harry_Potter. “more than the two that attacked us, you mean? of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed off fear and despair —” “all right, all right,” blustered Vernon_Dursley. “you’ve made your point —” “i Hope_Howell so,” said Harry_Potter, “because once i’m seventeen, all of them — death eaters, dementors, maybe even inferi — which means dead bodies enchanted by a dark wizard — will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. and if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, i think you’ll agree you need help.” there was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Rubeus_Hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. aunt Petunia_Dursley was looking at uncle Vernon_Dursley; Dudley_Dursley was staring at Harry_Potter. finally uncle Vernon_Dursley blurted out, “but what about my work? what about Dudley_Dursley’s school? i don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards —” “don’t you understand?” shouted Harry_Potter. “they will torture and kill you like they did my parents!” “dad,” said Dudley_Dursley in a loud voice, “dad — i’m going with these order people.” “Dudley_Dursley,” said Harry_Potter, “for the first time in your life, you’re talking sense.” he knew that the battle was won. if Dudley_Dursley was frightened enough to accept the order’s help, his parents would accompany him: there could be no question of being separated from their diddykins. Harry_Potter glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece. “they’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said, and when none of Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley replied, he left the room. the prospect of parting — probably forever — from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. what did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years’ solid dislike? back in his bedroom, Harry_Potter fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack, then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage. they fell with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them. “we’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry_Potter told her. “and then you’ll be able to fly again.” the doorbell rang. Harry_Potter hesitated, then headed back out of his room and downstairs. it was too much to expect Hestia_Jones and Dedalus_Diggle to cope with Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley on their own. “Harry_Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry_Potter had opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow. “an honor, as ever!” “thanks, Dedalus_Diggle,” said Harry_Potter, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark-haired Hestia_Jones. “it’s really good of you to do this. … they’re through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin. …” “good day to you, Harry_Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus_Diggle happily, striding into the living room. Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley did not look at all happy to be addressed thus; Harry_Potter half expected another change of mind. Dudley_Dursley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard. “i see you are packed and ready. excellent! the plan, as Harry_Potter has told you, is a simple one,” said Dedalus_Diggle, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. “we shall be leaving before Harry_Potter does. due to the danger of using magic in your house — Harry_Potter being still underage, it could provide the ministry with an excuse to arrest him — we shall be driving, say, ten Miles_Bletchley or so, before disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you. you know how to drive, i take it?” he asked uncle Vernon_Dursley politely. “know how to — ? of course i ruddy well know how to drive!” spluttered uncle Vernon_Dursley. “very clever of you, sir, very clever, i personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus_Diggle. he was clearly under the impression that he was flattering Vernon_Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word Dedalus_Diggle spoke. “can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus_Diggle nor Hestia_Jones seemed to hear him. “you, Harry_Potter,” Dedalus_Diggle continued, “will wait here for your guard. there has been a little change in the arrangements —” “what d’you mean?” said Harry_Potter at once. “i thought Alastor_Moody was going to come and take me by side-along-apparition?” “can’t do it,” said Hestia_Jones tersely. “Alastor_Moody will explain.” Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, “hurry up!” Harry_Potter looked all around the room before realizing that the voice had issued from Dedalus_Diggle’s pocket watch. “quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said Dedalus_Diggle, nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat. “we are attempting to time your departure from the house with your family’s disapparition, Harry_Potter; thus, the charm breaks at the moment you all head for safety.” he turned to Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley. “well, are we all packed and ready to go?” none of them answered him. uncle Vernon_Dursley was still staring, appalled, at the bulge in Dedalus_Diggle’s waistcoat pocket. “perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus_Diggle,” murmured Hestia_Jones. she clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room while Harry_Potter and Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley exchanged loving, possibly tearful farewells. “there’s no need,” Harry_Potter muttered, but uncle Vernon_Dursley made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly, “well, this is good-bye, then, boy.” he swung his right arm upward to shake Harry_Potter’s hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome. “ready, diddy?” asked aunt Petunia_Dursley, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry_Potter altogether. Dudley_Dursley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding Harry_Potter a little of the giant, Grawp. “come along, then,” said uncle Vernon_Dursley. he had already reached the living room door when Dudley_Dursley mumbled, “i don’t understand.” “what don’t you understand, popkin?” asked aunt Petunia_Dursley, looking up at her son. Dudley_Dursley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry_Potter. “why isn’t he coming with us?” uncle Vernon_Dursley and aunt Petunia_Dursley froze where they stood, staring at Dudley_Dursley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina. “what?” said uncle Vernon_Dursley loudly. “why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley_Dursley. “well, he — he doesn’t want to,” said uncle Vernon_Dursley, turning to glare at Harry_Potter and adding, “you don’t want to, do you?” “not in the slightest,” said Harry_Potter. “there you are,” uncle Vernon_Dursley told Dudley_Dursley. “now come on, we’re off.” he marched out of the room. they heard the front door open, but Dudley_Dursley did not move and after a few faltering steps aunt Petunia_Dursley stopped too. “what now?” barked uncle Vernon_Dursley, reappearing in the doorway. it seemed that Dudley_Dursley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. after several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said, “but where’s he going to go?” aunt Petunia_Dursley and uncle Vernon_Dursley looked at each other. it was clear that Dudley_Dursley was frightening them. Hestia_Jones broke the silence. “but … surely you know where your nephew is going?” she asked, looking bewildered. “certainly we know,” said Vernon_Dursley. “he’s off with some of your lot, isn’t he? right, Dudley_Dursley, let’s get in the car, you heard the man, we’re in a hurry.” again, Vernon_Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley_Dursley did not follow. “off with some of our lot?” Hestia_Jones looked outraged. Harry_Potter had met this attitude before: witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closest living relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry_Potter. “it’s fine,” Harry_Potter assured her. “it doesn’t matter, honestly.” “doesn’t matter?” repeated Hestia_Jones, her voice rising ominously. “don’t these people realize what you’ve been through? what danger you are in? the unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-voldemort movement?” “er — no, they don’t,” said Harry_Potter. “they think i’m a waste of space, actually, but i’m used to —” “i don’t think you’re a waste of space.” if Harry_Potter had not seen Dudley_Dursley’s lips move, he might not have believed it. as it was, he stared at Dudley_Dursley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing, Dudley_Dursley had turned red. Harry_Potter was embarrassed and astonished himself. “well … er … thanks, Dudley_Dursley.” again, Dudley_Dursley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling, “you saved my life.” “not really,” said Harry_Potter. “it was your soul the dementor would have taken. …” he looked curiously at his cousin. they had had virtually no contact during this summer or last, as Harry_Potter had come back to privet drive so briefly and kept to his room so much. it now dawned on Harry_Potter, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all. although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley_Dursley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings. after opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley_Dursley subsided into scarlet-faced silence. aunt Petunia_Dursley burst into tears. Hestia_Jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage as aunt Petunia_Dursley ran forward and embraced Dudley_Dursley rather than Harry_Potter. “s-so sweet, Dudley_Dursley …” she sobbed into his massive chest. “s-such a lovely b-boy … s-saying thank you …” “but he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia_Jones indignantly. “he only said he didn’t think Harry_Potter was a waste of space!” “yeah, but coming from Dudley_Dursley that’s like ‘i love you,’ ” said Harry_Potter, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as aunt Petunia_Dursley continued to clutch at Dudley_Dursley as if he had just saved Harry_Potter from a burning building. “are we going or not?” roared uncle Vernon_Dursley, reappearing yet again at the living room door. “i thought we were on a tight schedule!” “yes — yes, we are,” said Dedalus_Diggle, who had been watching these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. “we really must be off. Harry_Potter —” he tripped forward and wrung Harry_Potter’s hand with both of his own. “— good luck. i Hope_Howell we meet again. the Hope_Howells of the wizarding world rest upon your shoulders.” “oh,” said Harry_Potter, “right. thanks.” “farewell, Harry_Potter,” said Hestia_Jones, also clasping his hand. “our thoughts go with you.” “i Hope_Howell everything’s okay,” said Harry_Potter with a glance toward aunt Petunia_Dursley and Dudley_Dursley. “oh, i’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said diggle brightly, waving his hat as he left the room. Hestia_Jones followed him. Dudley_Dursley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and walked toward Harry_Potter, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. then Dudley_Dursley held out his large, pink hand. “blimey, Dudley_Dursley,” said Harry_Potter over aunt Petunia_Dursley’s renewed sobs, “did the dementors blow a different personality into you?” “dunno,” muttered Dudley_Dursley. “see you, Harry_Potter.” “yeah …” said Harry_Potter, taking Dudley_Dursley’s hand and shaking it. “maybe. take care, big d.” Dudley_Dursley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry_Potter heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed. aunt Petunia_Dursley, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, looked around at the sound. she did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with Harry_Potter. hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket, she said, “well — good-bye,” and marched toward the door without looking at him. “good-bye,” said Harry_Potter. she stopped and looked back. for a moment Harry_Potter had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him: she gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out of the room after her husband and son.
