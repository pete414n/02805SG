— chapter twenty-two — the unexpected task ‘potter! weasley! will you pay attention?’ professor Minerva_McGonagall’s irRita_Skeeterted voice cracked like a whip through the transfiguration class on thursday, and Harry_Potter andRonald_Weasleyboth jumped and looked up. it was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea-fowl they had been changing into guinea-pigs had been shut away in a large cage on professor Minerva_McGonagall’s desk (Neville_Longbottom’s guinea-pig still had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the blackboard (‘describe, with examples, the ways in which transforming spells must be adapted when performing cross-species switches’). the bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry_Potter and ron, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley’s fake wands at the back of the class, looked up,Ronald_Weasleynow holding a tin parrot, and Harry_Potter, a rubber haddock. ‘now potter and weasley have been kind enough to act their age,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry_Potter’s haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor – ron’s parrot’s beak had severed it moments before – ‘i have something to say to you all. ‘the yule ball is approaching – a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and an opportunity for us to socialise with our foreign guests. now, the ball will be open only to fourth-years and above – although you may invite a younger student if you wish –’ Lavender_Brown brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati_Patil patil nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she, too, fought not to giggle. they both looked around at Harry_Potter. professor Minerva_McGonagall ignored them, which Harry_Potter thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and ron. ‘dress robes will be worn,’ professor Minerva_McGonagall continued, ‘and the ball will start at eight o’clock on christmas day, finishing at midnight, in the great hall. now then –’ professor Minerva_McGonagall stared deliberately around the class. ‘the yule ball is of course a chance for us all to – er – let our hair down,’    she said, in a disapproving voice. Lavender_Brown giggled harder than ever, with her hand pressed hard against her mouth to stifle the sound. Harry_Potter could see what was funny this time: professor Minerva_McGonagall, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense. ‘but that does not mean,’ professor Minerva_McGonagall went on, ‘that we will be relaxing the Stanley_Shunpikedards of behaviour we expect from hogwarts students. i will be most seriously displeased if a gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way.’ the bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders. professor Minerva_McGonagall called above the noise, ‘potter – a word, if you please.’ assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock, Harry_Potter proceeded gloomily to the teacher’s desk. professor Minerva_McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then said, ‘potter, the champions and their partners –’ ‘what partners?’ said Harry_Potter. professor Minerva_McGonagall looked suspiciously at him, as though she thought he was trying to be funny. ‘your partners for the yule ball, potter,’ she said coldly. ‘your dance partners.’ Harry_Potter’s insides seemed to curl up and shrivel. ‘dance partners?’ he felt himself going red. ‘i don’t dance,’ he said quickly. ‘oh, yes, you do,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall irRita_Skeeterbly. ‘that’s what i’m telling you. traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.’ Harry_Potter had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails, accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress aunt Petunia_Dursley always wore to uncle Vernon_Dursley’s work parties. ‘i’m not dancing,’ he said. ‘it is traditional,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall firmly. ‘you are a hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school. so make sure you get yourself a partner, potter.’ ‘but – i don’t –’ ‘you heard me, potter,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, in a very final sort of way. * a week ago, Harry_Potter would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a hungarian horntail. but now that he had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought he’d rather have another round with the horntail. Harry_Potter had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at hogwarts for christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to privet drive, but he had always been very much in the minority before now. this year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry_Potter to be obsessed with the coming ball – or, at least, all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before. girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on christmas night … ‘why do they have to move in packs?’ Harry_Potter asked ron, as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry_Potter. ‘how’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?’ ‘lasso one?’Ronald_Weasleysuggested. ‘got any idea who you’re going to try?’ Harry_Potter didn’t answer. he knew perfectly well whom he’d like to ask, but working up the nerve was something else …Cho_Changwas a year older than he was; she was very pretty; she was a very good quidditch player, and she was also very popular.Ronald_Weasleyseemed to know what was going on inside Harry_Potter’s head. ‘listen, you’re not going to have any trouble. you’re a champion. you’ve just beaten a hungarian horntail. i bet they’ll be queuing up to go with you.’ in tribute to their recently repaired friendship,Ronald_Weasleyhad kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum. moreover, to Harry_Potter’s amazement, he turned out to be quite right. a curly-haired third-year hufflepuff girl to whom Harry_Potter had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry_Potter was so taken aback he said ‘no’ before he’d even stopped to consider the matter. the girl walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry_Potter had to endure Dean_Thomas’s, Seamus_Finnigan’s and ron’s taunts about her all through history of Magic_goblin. the following day, two more girls asked him, a second-year and (to his horror) a fifth-year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused. ‘she was quite good-looking,’ saidRonald_Weasleyfairly, after he’d stopped laughing. ‘she was a foot Tall_gobliner than me,’ said Harry_Potter, still unnerved. ‘imagine what i’d look like trying to dance with her.’ Hermione_Granger’s words about krum kept coming back to him. ‘they only like him because he’s famous!’ Harry_Potter doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn’t been school champion. then he wondered if this would bother him ifCho_Changasked him. on the whole, Harry_Potter had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task. he wasn’t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors any more, which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric_Diggory – he had an idea Cedric_Diggory might have told the hufflepuffs to leave Harry_Potter alone, in gratitude for Harry_Potter’s tip-off about the dragons. there seemed to be fewer support Cedric_Diggory diggory badges around, too. Draco_Malfoy malfoy, of course, was still quoting Rita_Skeeter skeeter’s article at him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it – and just to heighten Harry_Potter’s feeling of well-being, no story about Rubeus_Hagrid had appeared in the daily prophet. ‘she didn’ seem very int’rested in Magic_goblinal creatures, ter tell yeh the truth,’ Rubeus_Hagrid said, when Harry_Potter,Ronald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger asked him how his interview with Rita_Skeeter skeeter had gone during the last care of Magic_goblinal creatures lesson of term. to their very great relief, Rubeus_Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts. ‘she jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, Harry_Potter,’ Rubeus_Hagrid continued in a low voice. ‘well, i told her we’d been friends since i went ter fetch yeh from the dursleys. “never had to tell him off in four years?” she said. “never played you up in lessons, has he?” i told her no, an’ she didn’ seem happy at all. yeh’d think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry_Potter.’ ‘’course she did,’ said Harry_Potter, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more. ‘she can’t keep writing about what a tragic little hero i am, it’ll get boring.’ ‘she wants a new angle, Rubeus_Hagrid,’ saidRonald_Weasleywisely, as he shelled salamander eggs. ‘you were supposed to say Harry_Potter’s a mad delinquent!’ ‘but he’s not!’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked. ‘she should’ve interviewed snape,’ said Harry_Potter grimly. ‘he’d give her the goods on me any day. potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school …’ ‘said that, did he?’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, whileRonald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger laughed. ‘well, yeh might’ve bent a few rules, Harry_Potter, bu’ yeh’re all righ’ really, aren’ you?’ ‘cheers, Rubeus_Hagrid,’ said Harry_Potter, grinning. ‘you coming to this ball thing on christmas day, Rubeus_Hagrid?’ said ron. ‘though’ i might look in on it, yeah,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid gruffly. ‘should be a good do, i reckon. you’ll be openin’ the dancin’, won’ yeh, Harry_Potter? who’re you takin’?’ ‘no one, yet,’ said Harry_Potter, feeling himself going red again. Rubeus_Hagrid didn’t pursue the subject. the last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. rumours about the yule ball were flying everywhere, though Harry_Potter didn’t believe half of them – for inStanley_Shunpikece, that Albus_Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from madam Rosmerta. it seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the weird sisters. exactly who or what the weird sisters were Harry_Potter didn’t know, never having had access to a wizard’s wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the wwn (wizarding wireless network) that they were a very famous musical group. some of the teachers, like little professor flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry_Potter about the perfect summoning charm he had used during the first task of the triwizard tournament. other teachers were not so generous. nothing would ever deflect professor binns, for example, from ploughing on through his notes on goblin rebellions – as binns hadn’t let his own death Stanley_Shunpiked in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like christmas wasn’t going to put him off. it was amazing how he could make even Bloody_Baron and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percy_Weasley’s cauldron-bottom report. professors Minerva_McGonagall and moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes, too, and snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry_Potter. staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term. ‘evil, he is,’Ronald_Weasleysaid bitterly that night in the gryffindor common room. ‘springing a test on us on the last day. ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of revision.’ ‘mmm … you’re not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?’ said Hermione_Granger, looking at him over the top of her potions notes.Ronald_Weasleywas busy building a card castle out of his exploding snap pack – a much more interesting pastime than with muggle cards, because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second. ‘it’s christmas, Hermione_Granger,’ said Harry_Potter lazily; he was re-reading flying with the cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire. Hermione_Granger looked severely over at him, too. ‘i’d have thought you’d be doing something constructive, Harry_Potter, even if you don’t want to learn your antidotes!’ ‘like what?’ Harry_Potter said, as he watched joey jenkins of the cannons belt a bludger towards a ballycastle bats chaser. ‘that egg!’ Hermione_Granger hissed. ‘come on, Hermione_Granger, i’ve got ’til february the twenty-fourth,’ Harry_Potter said. he had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk, and hadn’t opened it since the celebration party after the first task. there were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy Wailing_Widow meant, after all. ‘but it might take weeks to work it out!’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘you’re going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don’t!’ ‘leave him alone, Hermione_Granger, he’s earned a bit of a break,’ said ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows. ‘nice look,Ronald_Weasley… go well with your dress robes, that will.’ it was Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley. they sat down at the table with Harry_Potter,Ronald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger asRonald_Weasleyfelt how much damage had been done. ‘ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?’ George_Weasley asked. ‘no, he’s off delivering a letter,’ said ron. ‘why?’ ‘because George_Weasley wants to invite him to the ball,’ said Fred_Weasley sarcastically. ‘because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat,’ said George_Weasley. ‘who d’you two keep writing to, eh?’ said ron. ‘nose out, ron, or i’ll burn that for you, too,’ said Fred_Weasley, waving his wand threateningly. ‘so … you lot got dates for the ball yet?’ ‘nope,’ said ron. ‘well, you’d better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘who’re you going with, then?’ said ron. ‘Angelina_Johnson,’ said Fred_Weasley promptly, without a trace of embarrassment. ‘what?’ said ron, taken aback. ‘you’ve already asked her?’ ‘good point,’ said Fred_Weasley. he turned his head and called across the common room, ‘oi! Angelina_Johnson!’ Angelina_Johnson, who had been chatting to Alicia_Spinnet spinnet near the fire, looked over at him. ‘what?’ she called back. ‘want to come to the ball with me?’ Angelina_Johnson gave Fred_Weasley an appraising sort of look. ‘all right, then,’ she said, and she turned back to Alicia_Spinnet and carried on chatting, with a bit of a grin on her face. ‘there you go,’ said Fred_Weasley to Harry_Potter and ron, ‘piece of cake.’ he got to his feet, yawning, and said, ‘we’d better use a school owl then, George_Weasley, come on …’ they left.Ronald_Weasleystopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smouldering wreck of his card castle at Harry_Potter. ‘we should get a move on, you know … ask someone. he’s right. we don’t want to end up with a pair of trolls.’ Hermione_Granger let out a splutter of indignation. ‘a pair of … what, excuse me?’ ‘well – you know,’ said ron, shrugging, ‘i’d rather go alone than with – with Eloise_Midgen midgen, say.’ ‘her acne’s loads better lately – and she’s really nice!’ ‘her nose is off-centre,’ said ron. ‘oh, i see,’ Hermione_Granger said, bristling. ‘so basically, you’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have you, even if she’s completely horrible?’ ‘er – yeah, that sounds about right,’ said ron. ‘i’m going to bed,’ Hermione_Granger snapped, and she swept off towards the girls’ staircase without another word. * the hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from beauxbatons and durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best this christmas. when the decorations went up, Harry_Potter noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school. everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual twelve christmas trees in the great hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and the suits of armour had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them. it was quite something to hear ‘oh come, all ye faithful’ sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words. several times, filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside the armour, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude. and still Harry_Potter hadn’t askedCho_Changto the ball. he andRonald_Weasleywere getting very nervous now, though as Harry_Potter pointed out,Ronald_Weasleywould look much less stupid than he would without a partner; Harry_Potter was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions. ‘i suppose there’s always moaning Myrtle_Warren,’ he said gloomily, referring to the ghost who haunted the girls’ toilets on the second floor. ‘Harry_Potter – we’ve just got to grit our teeth and do it,’ saidRonald_Weasleyon friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress. ‘when we get back to the common room tonight, we’ll both have partners – agreed?’ ‘er … ok,’ said Harry_Potter. but every time he glimpsedCho_Changthat day – during break, and then lunchtime, and once on the way to history of Magic_goblin – she was surrounded by friends. didn’t she ever go anywhere alone? could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom? but no – she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls. yet if he didn’t do it soon, she was bound to have been asked by somebody else. he found it hard to concentrate in snape’s antidote test, and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient – a bezoar – meaning that he received bottom marks. he didn’t care though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do. when the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the Mundungus_Fletchereon door. ‘i’ll meet you at dinner,’ he said toRonald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger, and he dashed off upstairs. he’d just have to askCho_Changfor a private word, that was all … he hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and (rather sooner than he had expected) he found her, emerging from a defence against the dark arts lesson. ‘er – cho? could i have a word with you?’ giggling should be made illegal, Harry_Potter thought furiously, as all the girls aroundCho_Changstarted doing it. she didn’t, though. she said, ‘ok’, and followed him out of earshot of her classmates. Harry_Potter turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs. ‘er,’ he said. he couldn’t ask her. he couldn’t. but he had to.Cho_Changstood there looking puzzled, watching him. the words came out before Harry_Potter had quite got his tongue around them. ‘wangoballwime?’ ‘sorry?’ said cho. ‘d’you – d’you want to go to the ball with me?’ said Harry_Potter. why did he have to go red now? why? ‘oh!’ said cho, and she went red, too. ‘oh, Harry_Potter, i’m really sorry,’ and she looked it, too. ‘i’ve already said i’ll go with someone else.’ ‘oh,’ said Harry_Potter. it was odd; a moment before, his insides had been writhing like snakes, but suddenly he didn’t seem to have any insides at all. ‘oh, ok,’ he said, ‘no problem.’ ‘i’m really sorry,’ she said again. ‘that’s ok,’ said Harry_Potter. they stood there looking at each other, and thenCho_Changsaid, ‘well –’ ‘yeah,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘well, bye,’ said cho, still very red. she walked away. Harry_Potter called after her, before he could stop himself. ‘who’re you going with?’ ‘oh – Cedric_Diggory,’ she said. ‘Cedric_Diggory diggory.’ ‘oh, right,’ said Harry_Potter. his insides had come back again. it felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence. completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to gryffindor tower, cho’s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took. ‘Cedric_Diggory – Cedric_Diggory diggory.’ he had been starting to quite like Cedric_Diggory – prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone’s favourite champion. now he suddenly realised that Cedric_Diggory was in fact a useless pretty-boy who didn’t have enough brains to fill an eggcup. ‘fairy lights,’ he said dully to the Fat_Lady – the password had been changed the previous day. ‘yes, indeed, dear!’ she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hairband as she swung forwards to admit him. entering the common room, Harry_Potter looked around, and to his surprise he sawRonald_Weasleysitting ashen faced in a diStanley_Shunpiket corner. Ginevra_Weasley was sitting with him, talking to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice. ‘what’s up, ron?’ said Harry_Potter, joining them.Ronald_Weasleylooked up at Harry_Potter, a sort of blind horror in his face. ‘why did i do it?’ he said wildly. ‘i don’t know what made me do it!’ ‘what?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘he – er – just asked Fleur_Delacour delacour to go to the ball with him,’ said Ginevra_Weasley. she looked as though she was fighting back a smile, but she kept patting ron’s arm sympathetically. ‘you what?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘i don’t know what made me do it!’Ronald_Weasleygasped again. ‘what was i playing at? there were people – all around – i’ve gone mad – everyone watching! i was just walking past her in the entrance hall – she was Stanley_Shunpikeding there talking to diggory – and it sort of came over me – and i asked her!’Ronald_Weasleymoaned and put his face in his hands. he kept talking, though the words were barely distinguishable. ‘she looked at me like i was a sea slug or something. didn’t even answer. and then – i dunno – i just sort of came to my senses and ran for it.’ ‘she’s part veela,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘you were right – her grandmother was one. it wasn’t your fault, i bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for diggory and got a blast of it – but she was wasting her time. he’s going with Cho_Chang.’Ronald_Weasleylooked up. ‘i asked her to go with me just now,’ Harry_Potter said dully, ‘and she told me.’ Ginevra_Weasley had suddenly stopped smiling. ‘this is mad,’ said ron, ‘we’re the only ones left who haven’t got anyone – well, except Neville_Longbottom. hey – guess who he asked? Hermione_Granger!’ ‘what?’ said Harry_Potter, completely distracted by this startling news. ‘yeah, i know!’ said ron, some of the colour coming back into his face as he started to laugh. ‘he told me after potions! said she’s always been really nice, helping him out with work and stuff – but she told him she was already going with someone. ha! as if! she just didn’t want to go with Neville_Longbottom … i mean, who would?’ ‘don’t!’ said Ginevra_Weasley, annoyed. ‘don’t laugh –’ just then Hermione_Granger climbed in through the portrait hole. ‘why weren’t you two at dinner?’ she said, coming over to join them. ‘because – oh, shut up laughing, you two – because they’ve both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball!’ said Ginevra_Weasley. that shut Harry_Potter andRonald_Weasleyup. ‘thanks a bunch, Ginevra_Weasley,’ saidRonald_Weasleysourly. ‘all the good-looking ones taken, ron?’ said Hermione_Granger loftily. ‘Eloise_Midgen midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? well, i’m sure you’ll find someone somewhere who’ll have you.’ butRonald_Weasleywas staring at Hermione_Granger as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light. ‘Hermione_Granger, Neville_Longbottom’s right – you are a girl …’ ‘oh, well spotted,’ she said acidly. ‘well – you can come with one of us!’ ‘no, i can’t,’ snapped Hermione_Granger. ‘oh, come on,’ he said impatiently, ‘we need partners, we’re going to look really stupid if we haven’t got any, everyone else has …’ ‘i can’t come with you,’ said Hermione_Granger, now blushing, ‘because i’m already going with someone.’ ‘no, you’re not!’ said ron. ‘you just said that to get rid of Neville_Longbottom!’ ‘oh, did i?’ said Hermione_Granger, and her eyes flashed dangerously. ‘just because it’s taken you three years to notice, ron, doesn’t mean no one else has spotted i’m a girl!’Ronald_Weasleystared at her. then he grinned again. ‘ok, ok, we know you’re a girl,’ he said. ‘that do? will you come now?’ ‘i’ve already told you!’ Hermione_Granger said, very angrily. ‘i’m going with someone else!’ and she stormed off towards the girls’ dormitories again. ‘she’s lying,’ saidRonald_Weasleyflatly, watching her go. ‘she’s not,’ said Ginevra_Weasley quietly. ‘who is it, then?’ saidRonald_Weasleysharply. ‘i’m not telling you, it’s her business,’ said Ginevra_Weasley. ‘right,’ said ron, who looked extremely put out, ‘this is getting stupid. Ginevra_Weasley, you can go with Harry_Potter, and i’ll just –’ ‘i can’t,’ said Ginevra_Weasley, and she went scarlet too. ‘i’m going with – with Neville_Longbottom. he asked me when Hermione_Granger said no, and i thought … well … i’m not going to be able to go otherwise, i’m not in fourth year.’ she looked extremely miserable. ‘i think i’ll go and have dinner,’ she said, and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed.Ronald_Weasleygoggled at Harry_Potter. ‘what’s got into them?’ he demanded. but Harry_Potter had just seen Parvati_Patil and Lavender_Brown come in through the portrait hole. the time had come for drastic action. ‘wait here,’ he said to ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati_Patil and said, ‘Parvati_Patil? will you go to the ball with me?’ Parvati_Patil went into a fit of giggles. Harry_Potter waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes. ‘yes, all right, then,’ she said finally, blushing furiously. ‘thanks,’ said Harry_Potter, in relief. ‘Lavender_Brown – will you go with ron?’ ‘she’s going with Seamus_Finnigan,’ said Parvati_Patil, and the pair of them giggled harder than ever. Harry_Potter sighed. ‘can’t you think of anyone who’d go with ron?’ he said, lowering his voice so thatRonald_Weasleywouldn’t hear. ‘what about Hermione_Granger granger?’ said Parvati_Patil. ‘she’s going with someone else.’ Parvati_Patil looked astonished. ‘ooooh – who?’ she said keenly. Harry_Potter shrugged. ‘no idea,’ he said. ‘so what about ron?’ ‘well …’ said Parvati_Patil slowly, ‘i suppose my sister might … Padma_Patil, you know … in ravenclaw. i’ll ask her if you like.’ ‘yeah, that would be great,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘let me know, will you?’ and he went back over to ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma_Patil patil’s nose was dead centre.
