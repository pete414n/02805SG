— chapter five — weasleys’ wizard wheezes Harry_Potter spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes. then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands, and brought himself to a halt in time to prevent himself falling face forwards out of the weasleys’ kitchen fire. ‘did he eat it?’ said Fred_Weasley excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry_Potter to his feet. ‘yeah,’ said Harry_Potter, straightening up. ‘what was it?’ ‘ton-tongue toffee,’ said Fred_Weasley brightly. ‘George_Weasley and i invented them, we’ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer …’ the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry_Potter looked around and saw that Ronald_Weasley and George_Weasley were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red- haired people Harry_Potter had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they must be: William_Weasley and Charles_Weasley, the two eldest weasley brothers. ‘how’re you doing, Harry_Potter?’ said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry_Potter shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers. this had to be Charles_Weasley, who worked with dragons in romania. Charles_Weasley was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy_Weasley and Ronald_Weasley who were both long and lanky. he had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscly, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it. William_Weasley got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry_Potter’s hand. William_Weasley came as something of a surprise. Harry_Potter knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts_Head_Goblin, that he had been head boy of hogwarts, and had always imagined William_Weasley to be an older version of Percy_Weasley; fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around. however, William_Weasley was – there was no other word for it – cool. he was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. he was wearing an earring with what looked like a Fang dangling from it. his clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry_Potter recognised his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide.    before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise, and Arthur_Weasley appeared out of thin air at George_Weasley’s shoulder. he was looking angrier than Harry_Potter had ever seen him. ‘that wasn’t funny, Fred_Weasley!’ he shouted. ‘what on earth did you give that muggle boy?’ ‘i didn’t give him anything,’ said Fred_Weasley, with another evil grin. ‘i just dropped it … it was his fault he went and ate it, i never told him to.’ ‘you dropped it on purpose!’ roared Arthur_Weasley. ‘you knew he’d eat it, you knew he was on a diet –’ ‘how big did his tongue get?’ George_Weasley asked eagerly. ‘it was four foot long before his parents would let me shrink it!’ Harry_Potter and the weasleys roared with laughter again. ‘it isn’t funny!’ Arthur_Weasley shouted. ‘that sort of behaviour seriously undermines wizard–muggle relations! i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles, and my own sons –’ ‘we didn’t give it to him because he was a muggle!’ said Fred_Weasley indignantly. ‘no, we gave it to him because he’s a great bullying git,’ said George_Weasley. ‘isn’t he, Harry_Potter?’ ‘yeah, he is, Arthur_Weasley,’ said Harry_Potter earnestly. ‘that’s not the point!’ raged Arthur_Weasley. ‘you wait until i tell your mother –’ ‘tell me what?’ said a voice behind them. Molly_Weasley had just entered the kitchen. she was a short, plump woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion. ‘oh, hello, Harry_Potter dear,’ she said, spotting him and smiling. then her eyes snapped back to her husband. ‘tell me what, Arthur_Weasley?’ Arthur_Weasley hesitated. Harry_Potter could tell that, however angry he was with Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley, he hadn’t really intended to tell Molly_Weasley what had happened. there was a silence, while Arthur_Weasley eyed his wife nervously. then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Molly_Weasley. one, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry_Potter and ron’s friend, Hermione_Granger. the other, who was small and red-haired, was ron’s younger sister, Ginevra_Weasley. both of them smiled at Harry_Potter, who grinned back, which made Ginevra_Weasley go scarlet – she had been very taken with Harry_Potter ever since his first visit to the burrow. ‘tell me what, Arthur_Weasley?’ Molly_Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of voice. ‘it’s nothing, Molly_Weasley,’ mumbled Arthur_Weasley, ‘Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley just – but i’ve had words with them –’ ‘what have they done this time?’ said Molly_Weasley. ‘if it’s got anything to do with weasleys’ wizard wheezes –’ ‘why don’t you show Harry_Potter where he’s sleeping, Ronald_Weasley’ said Hermione_Granger from the doorway. ‘he knows where he’s sleeping,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘in my room, he slept there last –’ ‘we can all go,’ said Hermione_Granger, pointedly. ‘oh,’ said Ronald_Weasley cottoning on. ‘right.’ ‘yeah, we’ll come, too,’ said George_Weasley – ‘you stay where you are!’ snarled Molly_Weasley. Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione_Granger and Ginevra_Weasley set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zig-zagged through the house to the upper storeys. ‘what are weasleys’ wizard wheezes?’ Harry_Potter asked, as they climbed. Ronald_Weasley and Ginevra_Weasley both laughed, although Hermione_Granger didn’t. ‘mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley’s room,’ said Ronald_Weasley quietly. ‘great long price-lists for stuff they’ve invented. joke stuff, you know. fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. it was brilliant, i never knew they’d been inventing all that …’ ‘we’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things,’ said Ginevra_Weasley, ‘we thought they just liked the noise.’ ‘only, most of the stuff – well, all of it, really – was a bit dangerous,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘and, you know, they were planning to sell it at hogwarts to make some money, and mum went mad at them. told them they weren’t allowed to make any more of it, and burnt all the order forms … she’s furious at them anyway. they didn’t get as many o.w.ls as she expected.’ o.w.ls were ordinary wizarding levels, the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen. ‘and then there was this big row,’ Ginevra_Weasley said, ‘because mum wants them to go into the ministry of magic like dad, and they told her all they want to do is open a joke-shop.’ just then, a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression. ‘hi, Percy_Weasley,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘oh, hello, Harry_Potter,’ said Percy_Weasley. ‘i was wondering who was making all the noise. i’m trying to work in here, you know – i’ve got a report to finish for the office – and it’s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs.’ ‘we’re not thundering,’ said Ronald_Weasley irRita_Skeeterbly. ‘we’re walking. sorry if we’ve disturbed the top-secret workings of the ministry of magic.’ ‘what are you working on?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘a report for the department of international magical co-operation,’ said Percy_Weasley smugly. ‘we’re trying to standardise cauldron thickness. some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin – leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three per cent a year –’ ‘that’ll change the world, that report will,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘front page of the daily prophet, i expect, cauldron leaks.’ Percy_Weasley went slightly pink. ‘you might sneer, Ronald_Weasley’ he said heatedly, ‘but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products which seriously endanger –’ ‘yeah, yeah, all right,’ said Ronald_Weasley and he started off upstairs again. Percy_Weasley slammed his bedroom door shut. as Harry_Potter, Hermione_Granger and Ginevra_Weasley followed Ronald_Weasley up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them. it sounded as though Arthur_Weasley had told Molly_Weasley about the toffees. the room at the top of the house where Ronald_Weasley slept looked much as it had done the last time that Harry_Potter had come to stay; the same posters of ron’s favourite quidditch team, the chudley cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fishtank on the window-sill which had previously held frog-spawn now contained one extremely large frog. ron’s old rat, scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny grey owl that had delivered ron’s letter to Harry_Potter in privet drive. it was hopping up and down in a small cage, and twittering madly. ‘shut up, pig,’ said Ronald_Weasley edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room. ‘Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley are in here with us, because William_Weasley and Charles_Weasley are in their room,’ he told Harry_Potter. ‘Percy_Weasley gets to keep his room all to himself because he’s got to work.’ ‘er – why are you calling that owl pig?’ Harry_Potter asked Ronald_Weasley ‘because he’s being stupid,’ said Ginevra_Weasley. ‘its proper name is Pigwidgeon.’ ‘yeah, and that’s not a stupid name at all,’ said Ronald_Weasley sarcastically. ‘Ginevra_Weasley named him,’ he explained to Harry_Potter. ‘she reckons it’s sweet. and i tried to change it, but it was too late, he won’t answer to anything else. so now he’s pig. i’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. he annoys me, too, come to that.’ Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry_Potter knew Ronald_Weasley too well to take him seriously. he had moaned continually about his old rat scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione_Granger’s cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him. ‘where’s Crookshanks?’ Harry_Potter asked Hermione_Granger now. ‘out in the garden, i expect,’ she said. ‘he likes chasing gnomes, he’s never seen any before.’ ‘Percy_Weasley’s enjoying work, then?’ said Harry_Potter, sitting down on one of the beds and watching the chudley cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling. ‘enjoying it?’ said Ronald_Weasley darkly. ‘i don’t reckon he’d come home if dad didn’t make him. he’s obsessed. just don’t get him onto the subject of his boss. according to mr crouch … as i was saying to mr crouch … mr crouch is of the opinion … mr crouch was telling me … they’ll be announcing their engagement any day now.’ ‘have you had a good summer, Harry_Potter?’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘did you get our food parcels and everything?’ ‘yeah, thanks a lot,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘they saved my life, those cakes.’ ‘and have you heard from –?’ Ronald_Weasley began, but at a look from Hermione_Granger he fell silent. Harry_Potter knew Ronald_Weasley had been about to ask about Sirius_Black. Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius_Black escape from the ministry of magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry_Potter’s godfather as he was. however, discussing him in front of Ginevra_Weasley was a bad idea. nobody but themselves and professor Albus_Dumbledore knew about how Sirius_Black had escaped, or believed in his innocence. ‘i think they’ve stopped arguing,’ said Hermione_Granger, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginevra_Weasley was looking curiously from Ronald_Weasley to Harry_Potter. ‘shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?’ ‘yeah, all right,’ said Ronald_Weasley the four of them left ron’s room and went back downstairs, to find Molly_Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad- tempered. ‘we’re eating out in the garden,’ she said when they came in. ‘there’s just not room for eleven people in here. could you take the plates outside, girls? William_Weasley and Charles_Weasley are setting up the tables. knives and forks, please, you two,’ she said to Ronald_Weasley and Harry_Potter, pointing her wand a little more vIgor_Karkaroffously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceilings. ‘oh, for heaven’s sake,’ she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the side and started skating across the floor, scooping up the potatoes. ‘those two!’ she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and Harry_Potter knew she meant Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley. ‘i don’t know what’s going to happen to them, i really don’t. no ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can …’ she slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it. a creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred. ‘it’s not as though they haven’t got brains,’ she continued irRita_Skeeterbly, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, ‘but they’re wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they’ll be in real trouble. i’ve had more owls from hogwarts about them than the rest put together. if they carry on the way they’re going, they’ll end up in front of the improper use of magic office.’ Molly_Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open. Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan. ‘i don’t know where we went wrong with them,’ said Molly_Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. ‘it’s been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won’t listen to – oh, not again!’ she had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse. ‘one of their fake wands again!’ she shouted. ‘how many times have i told those two not to leave them lying around?’ she grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking. ‘c’mon,’ Ronald_Weasley said hurriedly to Harry_Potter, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, ‘let’s go and help William_Weasley and Charles_Weasley.’ they left Molly_Weasley, and headed out of the back door into the yard. they had only gone a few paces when Hermione_Granger’s bandy-legged, ginger cat Crookshanks came pelting out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry_Potter recognised it instantly as a gnome. barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry_Potter could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house. the source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden and saw that William_Weasley and Charles_Weasley both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other’s out of the air. Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley were cheering; Ginevra_Weasley was laughing, and Hermione_Granger was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety. bill’s table caught Charles_Weasley’s with a huge bang, and knocked one of its legs off. there was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy_Weasley’s head poking out of a window on the second floor. ‘will you keep it down?’ he bellowed. ‘sorry, Percy_Weasley,’ said bill, grinning. ‘how’re the cauldron bottoms coming on?’ ‘very badly,’ said Percy_Weasley peevishly, and he slammed the window shut again. chuckling, William_Weasley and Charles_Weasley directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, William_Weasley reattached the table leg, and conjured tablecloths from nowhere. by seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Molly_Weasley’s excellent Cook_of_The_Hanged_Maning, and the nine weasleys, Harry_Potter and Hermione_Granger were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky. to somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, Harry_Potter listened rather than talked, as he helped himself to chicken-and-ham pie, boiled potatoes and salad. at the far end of the table, Percy_Weasley was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms. ‘i’ve told mr crouch that i’ll have it ready by tuesday,’ Percy_Weasley was saying pompously. ‘that’s a bit sooner than he expected it, but i like to keep on top of things. i think he’ll be grateful i’ve done it in good time. i mean, it’s extremely busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the world cup. we’re just not getting the support we need from the department of magical games and sports. Ludovic_Bagman bagman –’ ‘i like Ludovic_Bagman,’ said Arthur_Weasley mildly. ‘he was the one who got us such good tickets for the cup. i did him a bit of a favour: his brother, otto, got into a spot of trouble – a lawnmower with unnatural powers – i smoothed the whole thing over.’ ‘oh, bagman’s likeable enough, of course ,’ said Percy_Weasley dismissively, ‘but how he ever got to be head of department … when i compare him to mr crouch! i can’t see mr crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what’s happened to them. you realise Bertha_Jorkins has been missing for over a month now? went on holiday to albania and never came back?’ ‘yes, i was asking Ludovic_Bagman about that,’ said Arthur_Weasley, frowning. ‘he says Bertha_Jorkins’s got lost plenty of times before now – though i must say, if it was someone in my department, i’d be worried …’ ‘oh, Bertha_Jorkins’s Hope_Howellless, all right,’ said Percy_Weasley. ‘i hear she’s been shunted from department to department for years, much more trouble than she’s worth … but all the same, bagman ought to be trying to find her. mr crouch has been taking a personal interest – she worked in our department at one time, you know, and i think mr crouch was quite fond of her – but bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in australia instead of albania. however,’ Percy_Weasley heaved an impressive sigh, and took a deep swig of elderflower wine, ‘we’ve got quite enough on our plates at the department of international magical co-operation without trying to find members of other departments too. as you know, we’ve got another big event to organise right after the world cup.’ he cleared his throat significantly and looked down towards the end of the table where Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger were sitting. ‘you know the one i’m talking about, father.’ he raised his voice slightly. ‘the top-secret one.’ Ronald_Weasley rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry_Potter and Hermione_Granger, ‘he’s been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work. probably an exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.’ in the middle of the table, Molly_Weasley was arguing with William_Weasley about his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition. ‘… with a horrible great Fang on it, really, bill, what do they say at the bank?’ ‘mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how i dress as long as i bring home plenty of treasure,’ said William_Weasley patiently. ‘and your hair’s getting silly, dear,’ said Molly_Weasley, fingering her wand lovingly. ‘i wish you’d let me give it a trim …’ ‘i like it,’ said Ginevra_Weasley, who was sitting beside bill. ‘you’re so old-fashioned, mum. anyway, it’s nowhere near as long as professor Albus_Dumbledore’s …’ next to Molly_Weasley, Fred_Weasley, George_Weasley and Charles_Weasley were all talking spiritedly about the world cup. ‘it’s got to be ireland,’ said Charles_Weasley thickly, through a mouthful of potato. ‘they flattened peru in the semi-finals.’ ‘bulgaria have got Viktor_Krum, though,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘krum’s one decent player, ireland have got seven,’ said Charles_Weasley shortly. ‘i wish england had got through, though. that was embarrassing, that was.’ ‘what happened?’ said Harry_Potter eagerly, regretting more than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck in privet drive. Harry_Potter was passionate about quidditch. he had played as seeker on the gryffindor house quidditch team ever since his first year at hogwarts and owned a firebolt, one of the best racing brooms in the world. ‘went down to transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten,’ said Charles_Weasley gloomily. ‘shocking performance. and wales lost to uganda, and scotland were slaughtered by luxembourg.’ Arthur_Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their pudding (home-made strawberry ice-cream), and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry_Potter was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rose bushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks. Ronald_Weasley looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry_Potter, ‘so – have you heard from Sirius_Black lately?’ Hermione_Granger looked round, listening closely. ‘yeah,’ said Harry_Potter softly, ‘twice. he sounds ok. i wrote to him the day before yesterday. he might write back while i’m here.’ he suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius_Black and, for a moment, was on the verge of telling Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger about his scar hurting again, and about the dream which had awoken him … but he really didn’t want to worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful. ‘look at the time,’ Molly_Weasley said suddenly, checking her wristwatch. ‘you really should be in bed, the whole lot of you, you’ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the cup. Harry_Potter, if you leave your school list out, i’ll get your things for you tomorrow in diagon alley. i’m getting everyone else’s. there might not be time after the world cup, the match went on for five days last time.’ ‘wow – Hope_Howell it does this time!’ said Harry_Potter enthusiastically. ‘well, i certainly don’t,’ said Percy_Weasley sanctimoniously. ‘i shudder to think what the state of my in-tray would be if i was away from work for five days.’ ‘yeah, someone might slip dragon Mundungus_Fletcher in it again, eh, Percy_Weasley?’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘that was a sample of fertiliser from norway!’ said Percy_Weasley, going very red in the face. ‘it was nothing personal!’ ‘it was,’ Fred_Weasley whispered to Harry_Potter, as they got up from the table. ‘we sent it.’
