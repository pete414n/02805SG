— chapter thirty-seven — the beginning when he looked back, even a month later, Harry_Potter found he had few memories of the following days. it was as though he had been through too much to take in any more. the recollections he did have were very painful. the worst, perhaps, was the meeting with the diggorys that took place the following morning. they did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both thanked him for returning Cedric_Diggory’s body to them. mr diggory sobbed through most of the interview. mrs diggory’s grief seemed to be beyond tears. ‘he suffered very little, then,’ she said, when Harry_Potter had told her how Cedric_Diggory had died. ‘and after all, Amos_Diggory … he died just when he’d won the tournament. he must have been happy.’ when they had got to their feet, she looked down at Harry_Potter and said, ‘you look after yourself, now.’ Harry_Potter seized the sack of gold on the bedside table. ‘you take this,’ he muttered to her. ‘it should’ve been Cedric_Diggory’s, he got there first, you take it –’ but she backed away from him. ‘oh, no, it’s yours, dear, we couldn’t … you keep it.’ * Harry_Potter returned to gryffindor tower the following evening. from what Hermione_Granger and Ronald_Weasley told him, Albus_Dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast. he had merely requested that they leave Harry_Potter alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze. most people, he notiCedric_Diggory, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his eyes. some whispered behind their hands as he passed. he guessed that many of them had believed Rita_Skeeter’s article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was. perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how Cedric_Diggory had died. he found he didn’t care very much. he liked it best when he was with Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger, and they were talking about other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess.    he felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they didn’t need to put into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of what was going on outside hogwarts – and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain. the only time they touched upon the subject was when Ronald_Weasley told Harry_Potter about a meeting Molly_Weasley had had with Albus_Dumbledore before going home. ‘she went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer,’ he said. ‘but he wants you to go back to Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley, at least at first.’ ‘why?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘she said Albus_Dumbledore’s got his reasons,’ said Ronald_Weasley shaking his head darkly. ‘i suppose we’ve got to trust him, haven’t we?’ the only person apart from Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger that Harry_Potter felt able to talk to was Rubeus_Hagrid. as there was no longer a defence against the dark arts teacher, they had those lessons free. they used the one on thursday afternoon to go down and visit him in his cabin. it was a bright and sunny day; Fang bounded out of the open door as they approached, barking and wagging his tail madly. ‘who’s that?’ called Rubeus_Hagrid, coming to the door. ‘Harry_Potter!’ he strode out to meet them, pulled Harry_Potter into a one-armed hug, ruffled his hair and said, ‘good ter see yeh, mate. good ter see yeh.’ they saw two bucket-sized cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the fireplace when they entered Rubeus_Hagrid’s cabin. ‘bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe_Maxime,’ Rubeus_Hagrid said, ‘she’s jus’ left.’ ‘who?’ said Ronald_Weasley curiously. ‘madame maxime, o’ course!’ said Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘you two made it up, have you?’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘dunno what yeh’re talkin’ about,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid airily, fetching more cups from the dresser. when he had made tea, and offered round a plate of doughy biscuits, he leant back in his chair and surveyed Harry_Potter closely through his beetle-black eyes. ‘you all righ’?’ he said gruffly. ‘yeah,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘no, yeh’re not,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘’course yeh’re not. but yeh will be.’ Harry_Potter said nothing. ‘knew he was goin’ ter come back,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, and Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger looked up at him, shocked. ‘known it fer years, Harry_Potter. knew he was out there, bidin’ his time. it had ter happen. well, now it has, an’ we’ll jus’ have ter get on with it. we’ll fight. migh’ be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold. that’s Albus_Dumbledore’s plan, anyway. great man, Albus_Dumbledore. s’long as we’ve got him, i’m not too worried.’ Rubeus_Hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces. ‘no good sittin’ worryin’ abou’ it,’ he said. ‘what’s comin’ will come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does. Albus_Dumbledore told me wha’ you did, Harry_Potter.’ Rubeus_Hagrid’s chest swelled as he looked at Harry_Potter. ‘yeh did as much as yer father would’ve done, an’ i can’ give yeh no higher praise than that.’ Harry_Potter smiled back at him. it was the first time he’d smiled in days. ‘what’s Albus_Dumbledore asked you to do, Rubeus_Hagrid?’ he asked. ‘he sent professor Minerva_McGonagall to ask you and madame maxime to meet him … that night.’ ‘got a little job fer me over the summer,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘secret, though. i’m not s’posed ter talk abou’ it, not even ter you lot. Olympe_Maxime – madame maxime ter you – might be comin’ with me. i think she will. think i got her persuaded.’ ‘is it to do with voldemort?’ Rubeus_Hagrid flinched at the sound of the name. ‘migh’ be,’ he said evasively. ‘now … who’d like ter come an’ visit the las’ skrewt with me? i was jokin’ – jokin’!’ he added hastily, seeing the looks on their faces. * it was with a heavy heart that Harry_Potter packed his trunk up in the dormitory, on the night before his return to privet drive. he was dreading the leaving feast, which was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the inter-house championship would be announCedric_Diggory. he had avoided being in the great hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when it was nearly empty, to avoid the stares of his fellow students. when he, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger entered the hall, they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing. the great hall was normally decorated with the winning house’s colours for the leaving feast. tonight, however, there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers’ table. Harry_Potter knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect for Cedric_Diggory. the real Alastor_Moody moody was at the staff table, his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place. he was extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone spoke to him. Harry_Potter couldn’t blame him; moody’s fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk. professor karkaroff’s chair was empty. Harry_Potter wondered, as he sat down with the other gryffindors, where karkaroff was now; whether voldemort had caught up with him. madame maxime was still there. she was sitting next to Rubeus_Hagrid. they were talking quietly together. further along the table, sitting next to professor Minerva_McGonagall, was snape. his eyes lingered on Harry_Potter for a moment as Harry_Potter looked at him. his expression was difficult to read. he looked as sour and unpleasant as ever. Harry_Potter continued to watch him, long after snape had looked away. what was it that snape had done on Albus_Dumbledore’s orders, the night that voldemort had returned? and why … why … was Albus_Dumbledore so convinCedric_Diggory that snape was truly on their side? he had been their spy, Albus_Dumbledore had said so in the pensieve. snape had turned spy against voldemort, ‘at great personal risk’. was that the job he had taken up again? had he made contact with the death eaters, perhaps? pretended that he had never really gone over to Albus_Dumbledore, that he had been, like voldemort himself, biding his time? Harry_Potter’s musings were ended by professor Albus_Dumbledore, who stood up at the staff table. the great hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the leaving feast, became very quiet. ‘the end,’ said Albus_Dumbledore, looking around at them all, ‘of another year.’ he paused, and his eyes fell upon the hufflepuff table. theirs had been the most subdued table before he had got to his feet, and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the hall. ‘there is much that i would like to say to you all tonight,’ said Albus_Dumbledore, ‘but i must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here’ – he gestured towards the hufflepuffs – ‘enjoying our feast with us. i would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric_Diggory.’ they did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, ‘Cedric_Diggory.’ Harry_Potter caught a glimpse of Cho_Chang through the crowd. there were tears pouring silently down her face. he looked down at the table as they all sat down again. ‘Cedric_Diggory was a person who exemplified many of the qualities which distinguish hufflepuff house,’ Albus_Dumbledore continued. ‘he was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. his death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not. i think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about.’ Harry_Potter raised his head, and stared at Albus_Dumbledore. ‘Cedric_Diggory was murdered by Tom_Riddle.’ a paNicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoned whisper swept the great hall. people were staring at Albus_Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror. he looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silence. ‘the ministry of magic,’ Albus_Dumbledore continued, ‘does not wish me to tell you this. it is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that i have done so – either because they will not believe that Tom_Riddle has returned, or because they think i should not tell you so, young as you are. it is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric_Diggory died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.’ stunned and frightened, every face in the hall was turned towards Albus_Dumbledore now … or almost every face. over at the slytherin table, Harry_Potter saw Draco_Malfoy muttering something to crabbe and Goyle. Harry_Potter felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in his stomach. he forCedric_Diggory himself to look back at Albus_Dumbledore. ‘there is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric_Diggory’s death,’ Albus_Dumbledore went on. ‘i am talking, of course, about Harry_Potter.’ a kind of ripple crossed the great hall, as a few heads turned in Harry_Potter’s direction before flicking back to face Albus_Dumbledore. ‘Harry_Potter managed to escape Tom_Riddle,’ said Albus_Dumbledore. ‘he risked his own life to return Cedric_Diggory’s body to hogwarts. he showed, in every respect, the sort of brAvery_II that few wizards have ever shown in facing Tom_Riddle, and for this, i honour him.’ Albus_Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry_Potter, and raised his goblet once more. nearly everyone in the great hall followed suit. they murmured his name, as they had murmured Cedric_Diggory’s, and drank to him. but, through a gap in the standing figures, Harry_Potter saw that malfoy, crabbe, Goyle and many of the other slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched. Albus_Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them. when everyone had once again resumed their seats, Albus_Dumbledore continued, ‘the triwizard tournament’s aim was to further and promote magical understanding. in the light of what has happened – of Tom_Riddle’s return – such ties are more important than ever before.’ Albus_Dumbledore looked from madame maxime and Rubeus_Hagrid, to Fleur_Delacour and her fellow beauxbatons students, to Viktor_Krum and the durmstrangs at the slytherin table. krum, Harry_Potter saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though he expected Albus_Dumbledore to say something harsh. ‘every guest in this hall,’ said Albus_Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the durmstrang students, ‘will be welcomed back here, at any time, should they wish to come. i say to you all, once again – in the light of Tom_Riddle’s return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. ‘Tom_Riddle’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open. ‘it is my belief – and never have i so Hope_Howelld that i am mistaken – that we are all facing dark and difficult times. some of you, in this hall, have already suffered directly at the hands of Tom_Riddle. many of your families have been torn asunder. a week ago, a student was taken from our midst. ‘remember Cedric_Diggory. remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right, and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Tom_Riddle. remember Cedric_Diggory.’ * Harry_Potter’s trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it. he, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth-years for the carriages that would take them back to hogsmeade station. it was another beautiful summer’s day. he supposed that privet drive would be hot and leafy, its flowerbeds a riot of colour, when he arrived there that evening. the thought gave him no pleasure at all. ‘’arry!’ he looked around. Fleur_Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. beyond her, far across the grounds, Harry_Potter could see Rubeus_Hagrid helping madame maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. the beauxbatons carriage was about to take off. ‘we will see each uzzer again, i ’ope,’ said Fleur_Delacour, as she reached him, holding out her hand. ‘i am ’oping to get a job ’ere, to improve my eenglish.’ ‘it’s very good already,’ said Ronald_Weasley in a strangled sort of voice. Fleur_Delacour smiled at him; Hermione_Granger scowled. ‘goodbye, ’arry,’ said Fleur_Delacour, turning to go. ‘it ’az been a pleasure meeting you!’ Harry_Potter’s spirits couldn’t help but lift slightly, as he watched Fleur_Delacour hurry back across the lawns to madame maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight. ‘wonder how the durmstrang students are getting back?’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘d’you reckon they can steer that ship without karkaroff?’ ‘karkaroff did not steer,’ said a gruff voice. ‘he stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork.’ krum had come to say goodbye to Hermione_Granger. ‘could i have a vord?’ he asked her. ‘oh … yes … all right,’ said Hermione_Granger, looking slightly flustered, and following krum through the crowd and out of sight. ‘you’d better hurry up!’ Ronald_Weasley called loudly after her. ‘the carriages’ll be here in a minute!’ he let Harry_Potter keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what krum and Hermione_Granger might be up to. they returned quite soon. Ronald_Weasley stared at Hermione_Granger, but her face was impassive. ‘i liked diggory,’ said krum abruptly, to Harry_Potter. ‘he vos alvays polite to me. alvays. even though i vos from durmstrang – with karkaroff,’ he added, scowling. ‘have you got a new headmaster yet?’ said Harry_Potter. krum shrugged. he held out his hand as Fleur_Delacour had done, shook Harry_Potter’s hand and then ron’s. Ronald_Weasley looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle. krum had already started walking away when Ronald_Weasley burst out, ‘can i have your autograph?’ Hermione_Granger turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages which were now trundling towards them up the drive, as krum, looking surprised, but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for Ronald_Weasley * the weather could not have been more different on the journey back to king’s cross than it had been on their way to hogwarts the previous september. there wasn’t a single cloud in the sky. Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger had managed to get a compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under ron’s dress robes to stop him hooting continually; Hedwig was dozing, her head under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large, furry ginger cushion. Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger talked more fully and freely than they had done all week, as the train sped them southwards. Harry_Potter felt as though Albus_Dumbledore’s speech at the leaving feast had unblocked him, somehow. it was less painful to discuss what had happened now. they broke off their conversation about what action Albus_Dumbledore might be taking even now to stop voldemort, only when the lunch trolley arrived. when Hermione_Granger returned from the trolley and put her money back into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the daily prophet which she had been carrying in there. Harry_Potter looked at it, unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might say, but Hermione_Granger, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, ‘there’s nothing in there. you can look for yourself, but there’s nothing at all. i’ve been checking every day. just a small piece the day after the third task, saying you won the tournament. they didn’t even mention Cedric_Diggory. nothing about any of it. if you ask me, fudge is forcing them to keep quiet.’ ‘he’ll never keep Rita_Skeeter quiet,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘not on a story like this.’ ‘oh, Rita_Skeeter hasn’t written anything at all since the third task,’ said Hermione_Granger, in an oddly constrained voice. ‘as a matter of fact,’ she added, her voice now trembling slightly, ‘Rita_Skeeter isn’t going to be writing anything at all for a while. not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her.’ ‘what are you talking about?’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘i found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn’t supposed to be coming into the grounds,’ said Hermione_Granger in a rush. Harry_Potter had the impression that Hermione_Granger had been dying to tell them this for days, but that she had restrained herself in the light of everything else that had happened. ‘how was she doing it?’ said Harry_Potter at once. ‘how did you find out?’ said Ronald_Weasley staring at her. ‘well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea, Harry_Potter,’ she said. ‘did i?’ said Harry_Potter, perplexed. ‘how?’ ‘bugging,’ said Hermione_Granger happily. ‘but you said they didn’t work –’ ‘oh, not electronic bugs,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘no, you see … Rita_Skeeter’ – Hermione_Granger’s voice trembled with quiet triumph – ‘is an unregistered animagus. she can turn –’ Hermione_Granger pulled a small sealed glass jar out of her bag. ‘– into a beetle.’ ‘you’re kidding,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘you haven’t … she’s not …’ ‘oh, yes she is,’ said Hermione_Granger happily, brandishing the jar at them. inside were a few twigs and leaves, and one large, fat beetle. ‘that’s never – you’re kidding –’ Ronald_Weasley whispered, lifting the jar to his eyes. ‘no, i’m not,’ said Hermione_Granger, beaming. ‘i caught her on the window-sill in the hospital wing. look very closely, and you’ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears.’ Harry_Potter looked, and saw that she was quite right. he also remembered something. ‘there was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Rubeus_Hagrid telling madame maxime about his mum!’ ‘exactly,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘and Viktor_Krum pulled a beetle out of my hair after we’d had our conversation by the lake. and unless i’m very much mistaken, Rita_Skeeter was perched on the window-sill of the divination class the day your scar hurt. she’s been buzzing around for stories all year.’ ‘when we saw malfoy under that tree …’ said Ronald_Weasley slowly. ‘he was talking to her, in his hand,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘he knew, of course. that’s how she’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the slytherins. they wouldn’t care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Rubeus_Hagrid.’ Hermione_Granger took the glass jar back from Ronald_Weasley and smiled at the beetle, which buzzed angrily against the glass. ‘i’ve told her i’ll let her out when we get back to london,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘i’ve put an unbreakable charm on the jar, you see, so she can’t transform. and i’ve told her she’s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. see if she can’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people.’ smiling serenely, Hermione_Granger plaCedric_Diggory the beetle back inside her schoolbag. the door of the compartment slid open. ‘very clever, granger,’ said Draco_Malfoy. crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. all three of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry_Potter had ever seen them. ‘so,’ said malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment, and looking around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. ‘you caught some pathetic reporter, and potter’s Albus_Dumbledore’s favourite boy again. big deal.’ his smirk widened. crabbe and Goyle leered. ‘trying not to think about it, are we?’ said malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them. ‘trying to pretend it hasn’t happened?’ ‘get out,’ said Harry_Potter. he had not been near malfoy since he had watched him muttering to crabbe and Goyle during Albus_Dumbledore’s speech about Cedric_Diggory. he could feel a kind of ringing in his ears. his hand gripped his wand under his robes. ‘you’ve picked the losing side, potter! i warned you! i told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? when we met on the train, first day at hogwarts? i told you not to hang around with riff-raff like this!’ he jerked his head at Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger. ‘too late now, potter! they’ll be the first to go, now the dark lord’s back! mudbloods and muggle-lovers first! well – second – diggory was the f–’ it was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment. blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry_Potter blinked, and looked down at the floor. malfoy, crabbe and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. he, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex. nor were they the only ones to have done so. ‘thought we’d see what those three were up to,’ said Fred_Weasley matter-of-factly, stepping onto Goyle, and into the compartment. he had his wand out, and so did George_Weasley, who was careful to tread on malfoy as he followed Fred_Weasley inside. ‘interesting effect,’ said George_Weasley, looking down at crabbe. ‘who used the furnunculus curse?’ ‘me,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘odd,’ said George_Weasley lightly. ‘i used jelly-legs. looks as though those two shouldn’t be mixed. he seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face. well, let’s not leave them here, they don’t add much to the decor.’ Ronald_Weasley Harry_Potter and George_Weasley kicked, rolled and pushed the unconscious malfoy, crabbe and Goyle – each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit – out into the corridor, then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut. ‘exploding snap, anyone?’ said Fred_Weasley, pulling out a pack of cards. they were halfway through their fifth game when Harry_Potter decided to ask them. ‘you going to tell us, then?’ he said to George_Weasley. ‘who you were blackmailing?’ ‘oh,’ said George_Weasley darkly. ‘that.’ ‘it doesn’t matter,’ said Fred_Weasley, shaking his head impatiently. ‘it wasn’t anything important. not now, anyway.’ ‘we’ve given up,’ said George_Weasley, shrugging. but Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger kept on asking, and finally Fred_Weasley said, ‘all right, all right, if you really want to know … it was Ludovic_Bagman bagman.’ ‘bagman?’ said Harry_Potter sharply. ‘are you saying he was involved in –’ ‘nah,’ said George_Weasley gloomily. ‘nothing like that. stupid git. he wouldn’t have the brains.’ ‘well, what, then?’ said Ronald_Weasley Fred_Weasley hesitated, then said, ‘you remember that bet we had with him, at the quidditch world cup? about how ireland would win, but krum would get the snitch?’ ‘yeah,’ said Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley slowly. ‘well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he’d caught from the irish mascots.’ ‘so?’ ‘so,’ said Fred_Weasley impatiently, ‘it vanished, didn’t it? by next morning, it had gone!’ ‘but – it must’ve been an accident, mustn’t it?’ said Hermione_Granger. George_Weasley laughed very bitterly. ‘yeah, that’s what we thought, at first. we thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he’d made a mistake, he’d cough up. but nothing doing. ignored our letter. we kept trying to talk to him about it at hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to get away from us.’ ‘in the end, he turned pretty nasty,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘told us we were too young to gamble, and he wasn’t giving us anything.’ ‘so we asked for our money back,’ said George_Weasley, glowering. ‘he didn’t refuse!’ gasped Hermione_Granger. ‘right in one,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘but that was all your savings!’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘tell me about it,’ said George_Weasley. ‘’course, we found out what was going on in the end. Lee_Jordan’s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off bagman as well. turns out he’s in big trouble with the goblins. borrowed loads of gold off them. a gang of them cornered him in the woods after the world cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn’t enough to cover all his debts. they followed him all the way to hogwarts to keep an eye on him. he’s lost everything gambling. hasn’t got two galleons to rub together. and you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?’ ‘how?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘he put a bet on you, mate,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘put a big bet on you to win the tournament. bet against the goblins.’ ‘so that’s why he kept trying to help me win!’ said Harry_Potter. ‘well – i did win, didn’t i? so he can pay you your gold!’ ‘nope,’ said George_Weasley, shaking his head. ‘the goblins play as dirty as him. they say you drew with diggory, and bagman was betting you’d win outright. so bagman had to run for it. he made a run for it right after the third task.’ George_Weasley sighed deeply, and started dealing out the cards again. the rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry_Potter wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at king’s cross … but as he had learnt the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon the hogwarts express was slowing down at platform nine and three-quarters. the usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark. Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger struggled out past malfoy, crabbe and Goyle, carrying their trunks. Harry_Potter, however, stayed put. ‘Fred_Weasley – George_Weasley – wait a moment.’ the twins turned. Harry_Potter pulled open his trunk, and drew out his triwizard winnings. ‘take it,’ he said, and he thrust the sack into George_Weasley’s hands. ‘what?’ said Fred_Weasley, looking flabbergasted. ‘take it,’ Harry_Potter repeated firmly. ‘i don’t want it.’ ‘you’re mental,’ said George_Weasley, trying to push it back at Harry_Potter. ‘no, i’m not,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘you take it, and get inventing. it’s for the joke- shop.’ ‘he is mental,’ Fred_Weasley said, in an almost awed voice. ‘listen,’ said Harry_Potter firmly. ‘if you don’t take it, i’m throwing it down the drain. i don’t want it and i don’t need it. but i could do with a few laughs. we could all do with a few laughs. i’ve got a feeling we’re going to need them more than usual before long.’ ‘Harry_Potter,’ said George_Weasley weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, ‘there’s got to be a thousand galleons in here.’ ‘yeah,’ said Harry_Potter, grinning. ‘think how many canary creams that is.’ the twins stared at him. ‘just don’t tell your mum where you got it … although she might not be so keen for you to join the ministry any more, come to think of it …’ ‘Harry_Potter,’ Fred_Weasley began, but Harry_Potter pulled out his wand. ‘look,’ he said flatly, ‘take it, or i’ll hex you. i know some good ones now. just do me one favour, ok? buy Ronald_Weasley some different dress robes, and say they’re from you.’ he left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over malfoy, crabbe and Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex marks. uncle Vernon_Dursley was waiting beyond the barrier. Molly_Weasley was close by him. she hugged Harry_Potter very tightly when she saw him, and whispered in his ear, ‘i think Albus_Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer. keep in touch, Harry_Potter.’ ‘see you, Harry_Potter,’ said Ronald_Weasley clapping him on the back. ‘bye, Harry_Potter!’ said Hermione_Granger, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek. ‘Harry_Potter – thanks,’ George_Weasley muttered, while Fred_Weasley nodded fervently at his side. Harry_Potter winked at them, turned to uncle Vernon_Dursley, and followed him silently from the station. there was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back of Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley’ car. as Rubeus_Hagrid had said, what would come, would come … and he would have to meet it when it did.
