— chapter two — Marjorie_Dursley’s big mistake Harry_Potter went down to breakfast next morning to find the three dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table. they were watching a brand-new television, a for Dudley_Dursley, who had been welcome-home-for-the-summer present complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room. Dudley_Dursley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually. Harry_Potter sat down between Dudley_Dursley and uncle Vernon_Dursley, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of moustache. far from wishing Harry_Potter a happy birthday, none of Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley gave any sign that they had notiCedric_Diggory Harry_Potter enter the room, but Harry_Potter was far too used to this to care. he helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the newsreader on the television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict. ‘… the public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous. a special hotline has been set up, and any sighting of black should be reported immediately.’ ‘no need to tell us he’s no good,’ snorted uncle Vernon_Dursley, staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. ‘look at the state of him, the filthy layabout! look at his hair!’ he shot a nasty look sideways at Harry_Potter, whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle Vernon_Dursley. compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted, elbow- length tangle, Harry_Potter felt very well groomed indeed. the newsreader had reappeared. ‘the ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today –’ ‘hang on!’ barked uncle Vernon_Dursley, staring furiously at the newsreader. ‘you didn’t tell us where that maniac’s escaped from! what use is that? Luna_Lovegoodtic could be coming up the street right now!’ aunt Petunia_Dursley, who was bony and horse-faCedric_Diggory, whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry_Potter knew aunt Petunia_Dursley would simply    love to be the one to call the hotline number. she was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on her boring, law-abiding neighbours. ‘when will they learn,’ said uncle Vernon_Dursley, pounding the table with his large purple fist, ‘that hanging’s the only way to deal with these people?’ ‘very true,’ said aunt Petunia_Dursley, who was still squinting into next door’s runner-beans. uncle Vernon_Dursley drained his teacup, glanCedric_Diggory at his watch and added, ‘i’d better be off in a minute, Petunia_Dursley, Marjorie_Dursley’s train gets in at ten.’ Harry_Potter, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump. ‘Marjorie_Dursley?’ he blurted out. ‘sh-she’s not coming here, is she?’ Marjorie_Dursley was uncle Vernon_Dursley’s sister. even though she was not a blood relative of Harry_Potter’s (whose mother had been aunt Petunia_Dursley’s sister), he had been forCedric_Diggory to call her ‘aunt’ all his life. Marjorie_Dursley lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. she didn’t often stay in privet drive, because she couldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry_Potter’s mind. at Dudley_Dursley’s fifth birthday party, Marjorie_Dursley had whacked Harry_Potter around the shins with her walking stick to stop him beating Dudley_Dursley at musical statues. a few years later, she had turned up at christmas with a computerised robot for Dudley_Dursley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry_Potter. on her last visit, the year before Harry_Potter had started at hogwarts, Harry_Potter had accidentally trodden on the paw of her favourite dog. Ripper had chased Harry_Potter out into the garden and up a tree, and Marjorie_Dursley had refused to call him off until past midnight. the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley_Dursley’s eyes. ‘Marjorie_Dursley’ll be here for a week,’ uncle Vernon_Dursley snarled, ‘and while we’re on the subject,’ he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry_Potter, ‘we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect her.’ Dudley_Dursley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. watching Harry_Potter being bullied by uncle Vernon_Dursley was Dudley_Dursley’s favourite form of entertainment. ‘firstly,’ growled uncle Vernon_Dursley, ‘you’ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marjorie_Dursley.’ ‘all right,’ said Harry_Potter bitterly, ‘if she does when she’s talking to me.’ ‘secondly,’ said uncle Vernon_Dursley, acting as though he had not heard Harry_Potter’s reply, ‘as Marjorie_Dursley doesn’t know anything about your abnormality, i don’t want any – any funny stuff while she’s here. you behave yourself, got me?’ ‘i will if she does,’ said Harry_Potter through gritted teeth. ‘and thirdly,’ said uncle Vernon_Dursley, his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face, ‘we’ve told Marjorie_Dursley you attend st brutus’s secure centre for incurably criminal boys.’ ‘what?’ Harry_Potter yelled. ‘and you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be trouble,’ spat uncle Vernon_Dursley. Harry_Potter sat there, white-faCedric_Diggory and furious, staring at uncle Vernon_Dursley, hardly able to believe it. Marjorie_Dursley coming for a week-long visit – it was the worst birthday present Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley had ever given him, including that pair of uncle Vernon_Dursley’s old socks. ‘well, Petunia_Dursley,’ said uncle Vernon_Dursley, getting heavily to his feet, ‘i’ll be off to the station, then. want to come along for the ride, Dudley_Dursley?’ ‘no,’ said Dudley_Dursley, whose attention had returned to the television now that uncle Vernon_Dursley had finished threatening Harry_Potter. ‘duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie,’ said aunt Petunia_Dursley, smoothing Dudley_Dursley’s thick blond hair. ‘mummy’s bought him a lovely new bow-tie.’ uncle Vernon_Dursley clapped Dudley_Dursley on his porky shoulder. ‘see you in a bit, then,’ he said, and he left the kitchen. Harry_Potter, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden idea. abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed uncle Vernon_Dursley to the front door. uncle Vernon_Dursley was pulling on his car coat. ‘i’m not taking you,’ he snarled, as he turned to see Harry_Potter watching him. ‘like i wanted to come,’ said Harry_Potter coldly. ‘i want to ask you something.’ uncle Vernon_Dursley eyed him suspiciously. ‘third-years at hog – at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘so?’ snapped uncle Vernon_Dursley, taking his car keys from a hook next to the door. ‘i need you to sign the permission form,’ said Harry_Potter in a rush. ‘and why should i do that?’ sneered uncle Vernon_Dursley. ‘well,’ said Harry_Potter, choosing his words carefully, ‘it’ll be hard work, pretending to Marjorie_Dursley i go to that st whatsits …’ ‘st brutus’s secure centre for incurably criminal boys!’ bellowed uncle Vernon_Dursley, and Harry_Potter was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in uncle Vernon_Dursley’s voice. ‘exactly,’ said Harry_Potter, looking calmly up into uncle Vernon_Dursley’s large, purple face. ‘it’s a lot to remember. i’ll have to make it sound convincing, won’t i? what if i accidentally let something slip?’ ‘you’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you?’ roared uncle Vernon_Dursley, advancing on Harry_Potter with his fist raised. but Harry_Potter stood his ground. ‘knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Marjorie_Dursley forget what i could tell her,’ he said grimly. uncle Vernon_Dursley stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce. ‘but if you sign my permission form,’ Harry_Potter went on quickly, ‘i swear i’ll remember where i’m supposed to go to school, and i’ll act like a mug – like i’m normal and everything.’ Harry_Potter could tell that uncle Vernon_Dursley was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple. ‘right,’ he snapped finally. ‘i shall monitor your behaviour carefully during Marjorie_Dursley’s visit. if, at the end of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, i’ll sign your ruddy form.’ he wheeled around, pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out. Harry_Potter didn’t return to the kitchen. he went back upstairs to his bedroom. if he was going to act like a real muggle, he’d better start now. slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. then he went to Hedwig’s cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry_Potter sighed, then poked them both awake. ‘Hedwig,’ he said gloomily, ‘you’re going to have to clear off for a week. go with Errol, ron’ll look after you. i’ll write him a note, explaining. and don’t look at me like that’ – Hedwig’s large amber eyes were reproachful, ‘it’s not my fault. it’s the only way i’ll be allowed to visit hogsmeade with Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger.’ ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ronald_Weasley bound to her leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry_Potter, now feeling thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe. but Harry_Potter didn’t have long to brood. in next to no time, aunt Petunia_Dursley was shrieking up the stairs for Harry_Potter to come down and get ready to welcome their guest. ‘do something about your hair!’ aunt Petunia_Dursley snapped as he reached the hall. Harry_Potter couldn’t see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Marjorie_Dursley loved criticising him, so the untidier he looked, the happier she would be. all too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle Vernon_Dursley’s car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors, and footsteps on the garden path. ‘get the door!’ aunt Petunia_Dursley hissed at Harry_Potter. a feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry_Potter pulled the door open. on the threshold stood Marjorie_Dursley. she was very like uncle Vernon_Dursley; large, beefy and purple-faCedric_Diggory, she even had a moustache, though not as bushy as his. in one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog. ‘where’s my Dudley_Dursley?’ roared Marjorie_Dursley. ‘where’s my neffy poo?’ Dudley_Dursley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head, a bow-tie just visible under his many chins. Marjorie_Dursley thrust the suitcase into Harry_Potter’s stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized Dudley_Dursley in a tight one-armed hug and planted a large kiss on his cheek. Harry_Potter knew perfectly well that Dudley_Dursley only put up with Marjorie_Dursley’s hugs because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley_Dursley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist. ‘Petunia_Dursley!’ shouted Marjorie_Dursley, striding past Harry_Potter as though he was a hat- stand. Marjorie_Dursley and aunt Petunia_Dursley kissed, or rather, Marjorie_Dursley bumped her large jaw against aunt Petunia_Dursley’s bony cheekbone. uncle Vernon_Dursley now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door. ‘tea, Marjorie_Dursley?’ he said. ‘and what will Ripper take?’ ‘Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,’ said Marjorie_Dursley, as they all trooped into the kitchen, leaving Harry_Potter alone in the hall with the suitcase. but Harry_Potter wasn’t complaining; any excuse not to be with Marjorie_Dursley was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as he could. by the time he got back to the kitchen, Marjorie_Dursley had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry_Potter saw aunt Petunia_Dursley wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor. aunt Petunia_Dursley hated animals. ‘who’s looking after the other dogs, Marjorie_Dursley?’ uncle Vernon_Dursley asked. ‘oh, i’ve got colonel fubster managing them,’ boomed Marjorie_Dursley. ‘he’s retired now, good for him to have something to do. but i couldn’t leave poor old Ripper. he pines if he’s away from me.’ Ripper began to growl again as Harry_Potter sat down. this directed aunt Marjorie_Dursley’s attention to Harry_Potter for the first time. ‘so!’ she barked. ‘still here, are you?’ ‘yes,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘don’t you say “yes” in that ungrateful tone,’ Marjorie_Dursley growled. ‘it’s damn good of Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley to keep you. wouldn’t have done it myself. you’d have gone straight to an orphanage if you’d been dumped on my doorstep.’ Harry_Potter was bursting to say that he’d rather live in an orphanage than with Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley, but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him. he forCedric_Diggory his face into a painful smile. ‘don’t you smirk at me!’ boomed Marjorie_Dursley. ‘i can see you haven’t improved since i last saw you. i Hope_Howelld school would knock some manners into you.’ she took a large gulp of tea, wiped her moustache and said, ‘where is it that you send him, again, Vernon_Dursley?’ ‘st brutus’s,’ said uncle Vernon_Dursley promptly. ‘it’s a first-rate institution for Hope_Howellless cases.’ ‘i see,’ said Marjorie_Dursley. ‘do they use the cane at st brutus’s, boy?’ she barked across the table. ‘er –’ uncle Vernon_Dursley nodded curtly behind Marjorie_Dursley’s back. ‘yes,’ said Harry_Potter. then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly, he added, ‘all the time.’ ‘excellent,’ said Marjorie_Dursley. ‘i won’t have this namby-pamby, wishy- washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. a good thrashing is what’s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. have you been beaten often?’ ‘oh, yeah,’ said Harry_Potter, ‘loads of times.’ Marjorie_Dursley narrowed her eyes. ‘i still don’t like your tone, boy,’ she said. ‘if you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren’t hitting you hard enough. Petunia_Dursley, i’d write if i were you. make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boy’s case.’ perhaps uncle Vernon_Dursley was worried that Harry_Potter might forget their bargain; in any case, he changed the subject abruptly. ‘heard the news this morning, Marjorie_Dursley? what about that escaped prisoner, eh?’ * as Marjorie_Dursley started to make herself at home, Harry_Potter caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. uncle Vernon_Dursley and aunt Petunia_Dursley usually encouraged Harry_Potter to stay out of their way, which Harry_Potter was only too happy to do. Marjorie_Dursley, on the other hand, wanted Harry_Potter under her eye at all times, so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement. she delighted in comparing Harry_Potter with Dudley_Dursley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley_Dursley expensive presents while glaring at Harry_Potter, as though daring him to ask why he hadn’t got a present too. she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry_Potter such an unsatisfactory person. ‘you mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s turned out, Vernon_Dursley,’ she said over lunch on the third day. ‘if there’s something rotten on the inside, there’s nothing anyone can do about it.’ Harry_Potter tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger. remember the form, he told himself. think about hogsmeade. don’t say anything. don’t rise – Marjorie_Dursley reached for her glass of wine. ‘it’s one of the basic rules of breeding,’ she said. ‘you see it all the time with dogs. if there’s something wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong with the pup –’ at that moment, the wine glass Marjorie_Dursley was holding exploded in her hand. shards of glass flew in every direction and Marjorie_Dursley spluttered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping. ‘Marjorie_Dursley!’ squealed aunt Petunia_Dursley. ‘Marjorie_Dursley, are you all right?’ ‘not to worry,’ grunted Marjorie_Dursley, mopping her face with her napkin. ‘must have squeezed it too hard. did the same thing at colonel fubster’s the other day. no need to fuss, Petunia_Dursley, i have a very firm grip …’ but aunt Petunia_Dursley and uncle Vernon_Dursley were both looking at Harry_Potter suspiciously, so he decided he’d better skip pudding and escape from the table as soon as he could. outside in the hall, he leant against the wall, breathing deeply. it had been a long time since he’d lost control and made something explode. he couldn’t afford to let it happen again. the hogsmeade form wasn’t the only thing at stake – if he carried on like that, he’d be in trouble with the ministry of magic. Harry_Potter was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school. his record wasn’t exactly clean, either. only last summer he’d got an official warning which had stated quite clearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet drive, Harry_Potter would face expulsion from hogwarts. he heard Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way. * Harry_Potter got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his handbook of do-it-yourself broomcare whenever Marjorie_Dursley started on him. this worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look, because Marjorie_Dursley started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal. at last, at long last, the final evening of Marjorie_Dursley’s stay arrived. aunt Petunia_Dursley Cook_of_The_Hanged_Maned a fancy dinner and uncle Vernon_Dursley uncorked several bottles of wine. they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of Harry_Potter’s faults; during the lemon meringue pie, uncle Vernon_Dursley bored them all with a long talk about grunnings, his drill-making company; then aunt Petunia_Dursley made coffee and uncle Vernon_Dursley brought out a bottle of brandy. ‘can i tempt you, Marjorie_Dursley?’ Marjorie_Dursley had already had rather a lot of wine. her huge face was very red. ‘just a small one, then,’ she chuckled. ‘a bit more than that … and a bit more … that’s the boy.’ Dudley_Dursley was eating his fourth slice of pie. aunt Petunia_Dursley was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry_Potter really wanted to disappear into his bedroom, but he met uncle Vernon_Dursley’s angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out. ‘aah,’ said Marjorie_Dursley, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down. ‘excellent nosh, Petunia_Dursley. it’s normally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after …’ she burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach. ‘pardon me. but i do like to see a healthy-sized boy,’ she went on, winking at Dudley_Dursley. ‘you’ll be a proper-sized man, Dudley_Dursley, like your father. yes, i’ll have a spot more brandy, Vernon_Dursley …’ ‘now, this one here –’ she jerked her head at Harry_Potter, who felt his stomach clench. the handbook, he thought quickly. ‘this one’s got a mean, runty look about him. you get that with dogs. i had colonel fubster drown one last year. ratty little thing it was. weak. underbred.’ Harry_Potter was trying to remember page twelve of his book: a charm to cure reluctant reversers. ‘it all comes down to blood, as i was saying the other day. bad blood will out. now, i’m saying nothing against your family, Petunia_Dursley’ – she patted aunt Petunia_Dursley’s bony hand with her shovel-like one, ‘but your sister was a bad egg. they turn up in the best families. then she ran off with a wastrel and here’s the result right in front of us.’ Harry_Potter was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he thought. but he couldn’t remember what came next. Marjorie_Dursley’s voice seemed to be boring into him like one of uncle Vernon_Dursley’s drills. ‘this potter,’ said Marjorie_Dursley loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, ‘you never told me what he did?’ uncle Vernon_Dursley and aunt Petunia_Dursley were looking extremely tense. Dudley_Dursley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents. ‘he – didn’t work,’ said uncle Vernon_Dursley, with half a glance at Harry_Potter. ‘unemployed.’ ‘as i expected!’ said Marjorie_Dursley, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. ‘a no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who –’ ‘he was not,’ said Harry_Potter suddenly. the table went very quiet. Harry_Potter was shaking all over. he had never felt so angry in his life. ‘more brandy!’ yelled uncle Vernon_Dursley, who had gone very white. he emptied the bottle into Marjorie_Dursley’s glass. ‘you, boy,’ he snarled at Harry_Potter. ‘go to bed, go on –’ ‘no, Vernon_Dursley,’ hiccoughed Marjorie_Dursley, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry_Potter’s. ‘go on, boy, go on. proud of your parents, are you? they go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, i expect) –’ ‘they didn’t die in a car crash!’ said Harry_Potter, who found himself on his feet. ‘they died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!’ screamed Marjorie_Dursley, swelling with fury. ‘you are an insolent, ungrateful little –’ but Marjorie_Dursley suddenly stopped speaking. for a moment, it looked as though words had failed her. she seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger – but the swelling didn’t stop. her great red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech. next second, several buttons burst from her tweed Jack_Sloperet and pinged off the walls – she was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a salami … ‘Marjorie_Dursley!’ yelled uncle Vernon_Dursley and aunt Petunia_Dursley together, as aunt Marjorie_Dursley’s whole body began to rise off her chair towards the ceiling. she was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly. ‘nooooooo!’ uncle Vernon_Dursley seized one of Marjorie_Dursley’s feet and tried to pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. next second, Ripper had leapt forward and sunk his teeth into uncle Vernon_Dursley’s leg. Harry_Potter tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs. the cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it. in seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front door. he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenched up the loose floorboard and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents. he wriggled out, seized Hedwig’s empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as uncle Vernon_Dursley burst out of the dining room, his trouser leg in Bloody_Baron tatters. ‘come back in here!’ he bellowed. ‘come back and put her right!’ but a reckless rage had come over Harry_Potter. he kicked his trunk open, pulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle Vernon_Dursley. ‘she deserved it,’ Harry_Potter said, breathing very fast. ‘she deserved what she got. you keep away from me.’ he fumbled behind him for the catch on the door. ‘i’m going,’ Harry_Potter said. ‘i’ve had enough.’ and next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig’s cage under his arm.
