– chapter three – the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus Harry_Potter was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in magnolia crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. he sat quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic thumping of his heart. but after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook him: panic. whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. he was stranded, quite alone, in the dark muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. and the worst of it was, he had just done serious Magic_goblin, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from hogwarts. he had broken the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry so badly, he was surprised ministry of Magic_goblin representatives weren’t swooping down on him where he sat. Harry_Potter shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescent. what was going to happen to him? would he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? he thought ofRonald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger, and his heart sank even lower. Harry_Potter was sure that, criminal or not,Ronald_Weasleyand Hermione_Granger would want to help him now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them. he didn’t have any muggle money, either. there was a little wizard gold in the moneybag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts_Head_Goblin wizarding bank in london. he’d never be able to drag his trunk all the way to london. unless … he looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. if he was already expelled (his heart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit more Magic_goblin couldn’t hurt. he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father – what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak and flew to london? then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and … begin his life as an outcast. it was a horrible prospect, but he couldn’t sit on this wall for ever or he’d find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of    night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick. Harry_Potter opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the invisibility cloak – but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more. a funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry_Potter feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses. he bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. he had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was Stanley_Shunpikeding in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry_Potter squinted at the black alleyway. if only it would move, then he’d know whether it was just a stray cat or – something else. ‘lumos,’ Harry_Potter muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. he held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them, Harry_Potter saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes. Harry_Potter stepped backwards. his legs hit his trunk and he tripped. his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter. there was a deafening bang and Harry_Potter threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light … with a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. a second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights had screeched to a halt exactly where Harry_Potter had just been lying. they belonged, as Harry_Potter saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. gold lettering over the windscreen spelled the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus. for a split second, Harry_Potter wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night. ‘welcome to the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. just stick out your wand hand, step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go. my name is Stanley_Shunpike shunpike, and i will be your conductor this eve–’ the conductor stopped abruptly. he had just caught sight of Harry_Potter, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry_Potter snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. close to, he saw that Stanley_Shunpike shunpike was only a few years older than he was; eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and a fair few pimples. ‘what were you doin’ down there?’ said Stanley_Shunpike, dropping his professional manner. ‘fell over,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘’choo fall over for?’ sniggered Stanley_Shunpike. ‘i didn’t do it on purpose,’ said Harry_Potter, annoyed. one of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding. he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over, and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence. the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus’s headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was empty. ‘’choo lookin’ at?’ said Stanley_Shunpike. ‘there was a big black thing,’ said Harry_Potter, pointing uncertainly into the gap. ‘like a dog … but massive …’ he looked around at Stanley_Shunpike, whose mouth was slightly open. with a feeling of unease, Harry_Potter saw Stanley_Shunpike’s eyes move to the scar on Harry_Potter’s forehead. ‘woss that on your ’ead?’ said Stanley_Shunpike abruptly. ‘nothing,’ said Harry_Potter quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. if the ministry of Magic_goblin was looking for him, he didn’t want to make it too easy for them. ‘woss your name?’ Stanley_Shunpike persisted. ‘Neville_Longbottom longbottom,’ said Harry_Potter, saying the first name that came into his head. ‘so – so this bus,’ he went on quickly, hoping to distract Stanley_Shunpike, ‘did you say it goes anywhere?’ ‘yep,’ said Stanley_Shunpike proudly, ‘anywhere you like, long’s it’s on land. can’t do nuffink underwater. ’ere,’ he said, looking suspicious again, ‘you did flag us down, dincha? stuck out your wand ’and, dincha?’ ‘yes,’ said Harry_Potter quickly. ‘listen, how much would it be to get to london?’ ‘eleven sickles,’ said Stanley_Shunpike, ‘but for firteen you get ’ot chocolate, and for fifteen you get an ’ot-water bottle an’ a toofbrush in the colour of your choice.’ Harry_Potter rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag and shoved some silver into Stanley_Shunpike’s hand. he and Stanley_Shunpike then lifted his trunk, with Hedwig’s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus. there were no seats; instead, half-a-dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows. candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, illuminating the wood-panelled walls. a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, ‘not now, thanks, i’m pickling some slugs,’ and rolled over in his sleep. ‘you ’ave this one,’ Stanley_Shunpike whispered, shoving Harry_Potter’s trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. ‘this is our driver, Ernest_Prangprang. this is Neville_Longbottom longbottom, ern.’ Ernest_Prangprang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry_Potter, who nervously flattened his fringe again and sat down on his bed. ‘take ’er away, ern,’ said Stanley_Shunpike, sitting down in the armchair next to Ernest_Macmillan’s. there was another tremendous bang, and next moment Harry_Potter found himself flat on his bed, thrown backwards by the speed of the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus. pulling himself up, Harry_Potter stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street. Stanley_Shunpike was watching Harry_Potter’s stunned face with great enjoyment. ‘this is where we was before you flagged us down,’ he said. ‘where are we, ern? somewhere in wales?’ ‘ar,’ said Ernest_Macmillan. ‘how come the muggles don’t hear the bus?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘them!’ said Stanley_Shunpike contemptuously. ‘don’ listen properly, do they? don’ look properly either. never notice nuffink, they don’.’ ‘best go wake up madam marsh, Stanley_Shunpike,’ said ern. ‘we’ll be in abergavenny in a minute.’ Stanley_Shunpike passed Harry_Potter’s bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. Harry_Potter was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernest_Prangdidn’t seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn’t hit anything; lines of lamp posts, letter-boxes and bins jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed. Stanley_Shunpike came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a travelling cloak. ‘’ere you go, madam marsh,’ said Stanley_Shunpike happily, as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so towards the front of the bus. madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps. Stanley_Shunpike threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was another loud bang, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way. Harry_Potter wouldn’t have been able to sleep even if he had been travelling on a bus that didn’t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred Miles_Bletchley at a time. his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the dursleys had managed to get Marjorie_Dursley off the ceiling yet. Stanley_Shunpike had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. a large photograph of a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry_Potter from the front page. he looked strangely familiar. ‘that man!’ Harry_Potter said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. ‘he was on the muggle news!’ Stanley_Shunpike turned to the front page and chuckled. ‘Sirius_Black black,’ he said, nodding. ‘’course ’e was on the muggle news, Neville_Longbottom. where you been?’ he gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry_Potter’s face, removed the front page and handed it to Harry_Potter. ‘you oughta read the papers more, Neville_Longbottom.’ Harry_Potter held the paper up to the candlelight and read: black still at large Sirius_Black black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the ministry of Magic_goblin confirmed today. ‘we are doing all we can to recapture black,’ said the minister for Magic_goblin, Cornelius_Fudge fudge, this morning, ‘and we beg the Magic_goblinal community to remain calm.’ fudge has been criticised by some members of the international federation of warlocks for informing the muggle prime minister of the crisis. ‘well, really, i had to, don’t you know,’ said an irRita_Skeeterble fudge. ‘black is mad. he’s a danger to anyone who crosses him, Magic_goblin or muggle. i have the prime minister’s assurance that he will not breathe a word of black’s true identity to anyone. and let’s face it – who’d believe him if he did?’ while muggles have been told that black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand which muggles use to kill each other), the Magic_goblinal community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when black murdered thirteen people with a single curse.  Harry_Potter looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius_Black black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry_Potter had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his defence against the dark arts classes, and black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one. ‘scary-lookin’ fing, inee?’ said Stanley_Shunpike, who had been watching Harry_Potter read. ‘he murdered thirteen people?’ said Harry_Potter, handing the page back to Stanley_Shunpike, ‘with one curse?’ ‘yep,’ said Stanley_Shunpike. ‘in front of witnesses an’ all. broad daylight. big trouble it caused, dinnit, ern?’ ‘ar,’ said ern darkly. Stanley_Shunpike swivelled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look at Harry_Potter. ‘black woz a big supporter of you-know-’oo,’ he said. ‘what, voldemort?’ said Harry_Potter, without thinking. even Stanley_Shunpike’s pimples went white; ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus. ‘you outta your tree?’ yelped Stanley_Shunpike. ‘’choo say ’is name for?’ ‘sorry,’ said Harry_Potter hastily. ‘sorry, i – i forgot –’ ‘forgot!’ said Stanley_Shunpike weakly. ‘blimey, my ’eart’s goin’ that fast …’ ‘so – so black was a supporter of Tom_Riddle?’ Harry_Potter prompted apologetically. ‘yeah,’ said Stanley_Shunpike, still rubbing his chest. ‘yeah, that’s right. very close to you-know-’oo, they say … anyway, when little ’arry potter put paid to you- know-’oo’ – Harry_Potter nervously flattened his fringe down again – ‘all you- know-’oo’s supporters was tracked down, wasn’t they, ern? most of ’em knew it was all over, wiv you-know-’oo gone, and they came quiet. but not Sirius_Black black. i ’eard he thought ’e’d be second-in-command once you- know-’oo ’ad taken over. ‘anyway, they cornered black in the middle of a street full of muggles an’ black took out ’is wand and ’e blasted ’alf the street apart, an’ a wizard got it, an’ so did a dozen muggles what got in the way. ’orrible, eh? an’ you know what black did then?’ Stanley_Shunpike continued in a dramatic whisper. ‘what?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘laughed,’ said Stanley_Shunpike. ‘jus’ stood  laughed. an’ when reinforcements from the ministry of Magic_goblin got there, ’e went wiv ’em quiet as anyfink, still laughing ’is ’ead off. ’cos ’e’s mad, inee, ern? inee mad?’ there an’   ‘if he weren’t when he went to azkaban, he will be now,’ said ern in his slow voice. ‘i’d blow meself up before i set foot in that place. serves him right, mind … after what he did …’ ‘they ’ad a job coverin’ it up, din’ they, ern?’ Stanley_Shunpike said. ‘’ole street blown up an’ all them muggles dead. what was it they said ’ad ’appened, ern?’ ‘gas explosion,’ grunted Ernest_Macmillan. ‘an’ now ’e’s out,’ said Stanley_Shunpike, examining the newspaper picture of black’s gaunt face again. ‘never been a breakout from azkaban before, ’as there, ern? beats me ’ow ’e did it. frightenin’, eh? mind, i don’t fancy ’is chances against them azkaban guards, eh, ern?’ Ernest_Prangsuddenly shivered. ‘talk about summat else, Stanley_Shunpike, there’s a good lad. them azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.’ Stanley_Shunpike put the paper away reluctantly and Harry_Potter leant against the window of the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus, feeling worse than ever. he couldn’t help imagining what Stanley_Shunpike might be telling his passengers in a few nights’ time. ‘’ear about that ’arry potter? blew up ’is aunt! we ’ad ’im ’ere on the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus, di’n’t we, ern? ’e was tryin’ to run for it …’ he, Harry_Potter, had broken wizard law just like Sirius_Black black. was inflating Marjorie_Dursley bad enough to land him in azkaban? Harry_Potter didn’t know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he’d ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Rubeus_Hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had spent two months there only last year. Harry_Potter wouldn’t soon forget the look of terror on Rubeus_Hagrid’s face when he had been told where he was going, and Rubeus_Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry_Potter knew. the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and bollards, telephone boxes and trees, and Harry_Potter lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. after a while, Stanley_Shunpike remembered that Harry_Potter had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry_Potter’s pillow when the bus moved abruptly from anglesey to aberdeen. one by one, wizards and witches in dressing- gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. they all looked very pleased to go. finally, Harry_Potter was the only passenger left. ‘right then, Neville_Longbottom,’ said Stanley_Shunpike, clapping his hands, ‘whereabouts in london?’ ‘diagon alley,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘righto,’ said Stanley_Shunpike, ‘’old tight, then …’ bang! they were thundering along charing cross road. Harry_Potter sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus’s way. the sky was getting a little lighter. he would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts_Head_Goblin the moment it opened, then set off – where, he didn’t know. ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby-looking pub, the leaky cauldron, behind which lay the Magic_goblinal entrance to diagon alley. ‘thanks,’ Harry_Potter said to ern. he jumped down the steps and helped Stanley_Shunpike lower his trunk and Hedwig’s cage onto the pavement. ‘well,’ said Harry_Potter, ‘bye then!’ but Stanley_Shunpike wasn’t paying attention. still Stanley_Shunpikeding in the doorway to the bus, he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldron. ‘there you are, Harry_Potter,’ said a voice. before Harry_Potter could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. at the same time, Stanley_Shunpike shouted, ‘blimey! ern, come ’ere! come ’ere!’ Harry_Potter looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach – he had walked right into Cornelius_Fudge fudge, the minister for Magic_goblin himself. Stanley_Shunpike leapt onto the pavement beside them. ‘what didja call Neville_Longbottom, minister?’ he said excitedly. fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted. ‘Neville_Longbottom?’ he repeated, frowning. ‘this is Harry_Potter potter.’ ‘i knew it!’ Stanley_Shunpike shouted gleefully. ‘ern! ern! guess ’oo Neville_Longbottom is, ern! ’e’s ’arry potter! i can see ’is scar!’ ‘yes,’ said fudge testily. ‘well, i’m very glad the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead bus picked Harry_Potter up, but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron now …’ fudge increased the pressure on Harry_Potter’s shoulder, and Harry_Potter found himself being steered inside the pub. a stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. it was tom, the wizened, toothless landlord. ‘you’ve got him, minister!’ said tom. ‘will you be wanting anything? beer? brandy?’ ‘perhaps a pot of tea,’ said fudge, who still hadn’t let go of Harry_Potter. there was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stanley_Shunpike and ern appeared, carrying Harry_Potter’s trunk and Hedwig’s cage and looking around excitedly. ‘’ow come you di’n’t tell us ’oo you are, eh, Neville_Longbottom?’ said Stanley_Shunpike, beaming at Harry_Potter, while Ernest_Macmillan’s owlish face peered interestedly over Stanley_Shunpike’s shoulder. ‘and a private parlour, please, tom,’ said fudge pointedly. ‘bye,’ Harry_Potter said miserably to Stanley_Shunpike and ern, asTom_Riddlebeckoned fudge towards the passage that led from the bar. ‘bye, Neville_Longbottom!’ called Stanley_Shunpike. fudge marched Harry_Potter along the narrow passage after tom’s lantern, and then into a small parlour.Tom_Riddleclicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room. ‘sit down, Harry_Potter,’ said fudge, indicating a chair by the fire. Harry_Potter sat down, feeling goosebumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry_Potter. ‘i am Cornelius_Fudge fudge, Harry_Potter. the minister for Magic_goblin.’ Harry_Potter already knew this, of course; he had seen fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his father’s invisibility cloak at the time, fudge wasn’t to know that.Tom_Riddlethe innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. he placed the tray on a table between fudge and Harry_Potter, and left the parlour, closing the door behind him. ‘well, Harry_Potter,’ said fudge, pouring out tea, ‘you’ve had us all in a right flap, i don’t mind telling you. running away from your aunt and uncle’s house like that! i’d started to think … but you’re safe, and that’s what matters.’ fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate towards Harry_Potter. ‘eat, Harry_Potter, you look dead on your feet. now then … you will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of miss Marjorie_Dursley dursley. two members of the accidental Magic_goblin reversal squad were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago. miss dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. she has no recollection of the incident at all. so that’s that, and no harm done.’ fudge smiled at Harry_Potter over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favourite nephew. Harry_Potter, who couldn’t believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn’t think of anything to say, and closed it again. ‘ah, you’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?’ said fudge. ‘well, i won’t deny that they are extremely angry, Harry_Potter, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays.’ Harry_Potter unstuck his throat. ‘i always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays,’ he said, ‘and i don’t ever want to go back to privet drive.’ ‘now, now, i’m sure you’ll feel differently once you’ve calmed down,’ said fudge in a worried tone. ‘they are your family, after all, and i’m sure you are fond of each other – er – very deep down.’ it didn’t occur to Harry_Potter to put fudge right. he was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now. ‘so all that remains,’ said fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, ‘is to decide where you’re going to spend the last three weeks of your holidays. i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron and –’ ‘hang on,’ blurted Harry_Potter, ‘what about my punishment?’ fudge blinked. ‘punishment?’ ‘i broke the law!’ Harry_Potter said. ‘the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry!’ ‘oh, my dear boy, we’re not going to punish you for a little thing like that!’ cried fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. ‘it was an accident! we don’t send people to azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!’ but this didn’t Tall_gobliny at all with Harry_Potter’s past dealings with the ministry of Magic_goblin. ‘last year, i got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle’s house!’ said Harry_Potter, frowning. ‘the ministry of Magic_goblin said i’d be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more Magic_goblin there!’ unless Harry_Potter’s eyes were deceiving him, fudge was suddenly looking awkward. ‘circumStanley_Shunpikeces change, Harry_Potter … we have to take into account … in the present climate … surely you don’t want to be expelled?’ ‘of course i don’t,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘well then, what’s all the fuss about?’ laughed fudge airily. ‘now, have a crumpet, Harry_Potter, while i go and see if tom’s got a room for you.’ fudge strode out of the parlour and Harry_Potter stared after him. there was something extremely odd going on. why had fudge been waiting for him at the leaky cauldron, if not to punish him for what he’d done? and now Harry_Potter came to think of it, surely it wasn’t usual for the minister for Magic_goblin himself to get involved in matters of underage Magic_goblin? fudge came back, accompanied byTom_Riddlethe innkeeper. ‘room eleven’s free, Harry_Potter,’ said fudge. ‘i think you’ll be very comfortable. just one thing, and i’m sure you’ll underStanley_Shunpiked: i don’t want you wandering off into muggle london, all right? keep to diagon alley. and you’re to be back here before dark each night. sure you’ll underStanley_Shunpiked.Tom_Riddlewill be keeping an eye on you for me.’ ‘ok,’ said Harry_Potter slowly, ‘but why –?’ ‘don’t want to lose you again, do we?’ said fudge with a hearty laugh. ‘no, no … best we know where you are … i mean …’ fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak. ‘well, i’ll be off, plenty to do, you know.’ ‘have you had any luck with black yet?’ Harry_Potter asked. fudge’s fingers slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak. ‘what’s that? oh, you’ve heard – well, no, not yet, but it’s only a matter of time. the azkaban guards have never yet failed … and they are angrier than i’ve ever seen them.’ fudge shuddered slightly. ‘so, i’ll say goodbye.’ he held out his hand and Harry_Potter, shaking it, had a sudden idea. ‘er – minister? can i ask you something?’ ‘certainly,’ smiled fudge. ‘well, third-years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn’t sign the permission form. d’you think you could?’ fudge was looking uncomfortable. ‘ah,’ he said. ‘no. no, i’m very sorry, Harry_Potter, but as i’m not your parent or guardian –’ ‘but you’re the minister for Magic_goblin,’ said Harry_Potter eagerly. ‘if you gave me permission –’ ‘no, i’m sorry, Harry_Potter, but rules are rules,’ said fudge flatly. ‘perhaps you’ll be able to visit hogsmeade next year. in fact, i think it best if you don’t … yes … well, i’ll be off. enjoy your stay, Harry_Potter.’ and with a last smile and shake of Harry_Potter’s hand, fudge left the room.Tom_Riddlenow moved forward, beaming at Harry_Potter. ‘if you’ll follow me, mr potter,’ he said. ‘i’ve already taken your things up …’ Harry_Potter followedTom_Riddleup a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it, whichTom_Riddleunlocked and opened for him. inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe – ‘Hedwig!’ Harry_Potter gasped. the snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry_Potter’s arm. ‘very smart owl you’ve got there,’ chuckled tom. ‘arrived about five minutes after you did. if there’s anything you need, mr potter, don’t hesitate to ask.’ he gave another bow and left. Harry_Potter sat on his bed for a long time, absent-mindedly stroking Hedwig. the sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold, steely grey and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harry_Potter could hardly believe that he’d only left privet drive a few hours ago, that he wasn’t expelled, and that he was now facing three completely dursley-free weeks. ‘it’s been a very weird night, Hedwig,’ he yawned. and without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep.
