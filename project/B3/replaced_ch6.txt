– chapter six – talons and tea leaves when Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger entered the great hall for breakfast next day, the first thing they saw was Draco_Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of slytherins with a very funny story. as they passed, malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter. ‘ignore him,’ said Hermione_Granger, who was right behind Harry_Potter. ‘just ignore him, it’s not worth it …’ ‘hey, potter!’ shrieked Pansy_Parkinson, a slytherin girl with a face like a pug. ‘potter! the dementors are coming, potter! woooooooo!’ Harry_Potter dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table, next to Fred_Weasley. ‘new third-year timetables,’ said George_Weasley, passing them over. ‘what’s up with you, Harry_Potter?’ ‘malfoy,’ said Ronald_Weasley sitting down on George_Weasley’s other side and glaring over at the slytherin table. George_Weasley looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terror again. ‘that little git,’ he said calmly. ‘he wasn’t so cocky last night when the dementors were down our end of the train. came running into our compartment, didn’t he, Fred_Weasley?’ ‘nearly wet himself,’ said Fred_Weasley, with a contemptuous glance at malfoy. ‘i wasn’t too happy myself,’ said George_Weasley. ‘they’re horrible things, those dementors …’ ‘sort of freeze your insides, don’t they?’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘you didn’t pass out, though, did you?’ said Harry_Potter in a low voice. ‘forget it, Harry_Potter,’ said George_Weasley bracingly. ‘dad had to go out to azkaban one time, remember, Fred_Weasley? and he said it was the worst place he’d ever been. he came back all weak and shaking … they suck the happiness out of a place, dementors. most of the prisoners go mad in there.’ ‘anyway, we’ll see how happy malfoy looks after our first quidditch match,’ said Fred_Weasley. ‘gryffindor versus slytherin, first game of the season,    remember?’ the only time Harry_Potter and malfoy had faced each other in a quidditch match, malfoy had definitely come off worse. feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry_Potter helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes. Hermione_Granger was examining her new timetable. ‘ooh, good, we’re starting some new subjects today,’ she said happily. ‘Hermione_Granger,’ said Ronald_Weasley frowning as he looked over her shoulder, ‘they’ve messed up your timetable. look – they’ve got you down for about ten subjects a day. there isn’t enough time.’ ‘i’ll manage. i’ve fixed it all with professor Minerva_McGonagall.’ ‘but look,’ said Ronald_Weasley laughing, ‘see this morning? nine o’clock, divination. and underneath, nine o’clock, muggle studies. and –’ Ronald_Weasley leant closer to the timetable, disbelieving, ‘look – underneath that, arithmancy, nine o’clock. i mean, i know you’re good, Hermione_Granger, but no one’s that good. how’re you supposed to be in three classes at once?’ ‘don’t be silly,’ said Hermione_Granger shortly. ‘of course i won’t be in three classes at once.’ ‘well, then –’ ‘pass the marmalade,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘but –’ ‘oh, Ronald_Weasley what’s it to you if my timetable’s a bit full?’ Hermione_Granger snapped. ‘i told you, i’ve fixed it all with professor Minerva_McGonagall.’ just then, Rubeus_Hagrid entered the great hall. he was wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was absent-mindedly swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand. ‘all righ’?’ he said eagerly, pausing on the way to the staff table. ‘yer in my firs’ ever lesson! right after lunch! bin up since five gettin’ everythin’ ready … Hope_Howell it’s ok … me, a teacher … hones’ly …’ he grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table, still swinging the polecat. ‘wonder what he’s been getting ready?’ said Ronald_Weasley a note of anxiety in his voice. the hall was starting to empty as people headed off towards their first lesson. Ronald_Weasley checked his timetable. ‘we’d better go, look, divination’s at the top of north tower. it’ll take us ten minutes to get there …’ they finished their breakfast hastily, said goodbye to Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley and walked back through the hall. as they passed the slytherin table, malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit. the shouts of laughter followed Harry_Potter into the entrance hall. the journey through the castle to north tower was a long one. two years at hogwarts hadn’t taught them everything about the castle, and they had never been inside north tower before. ‘there’s – got – to – be – a – short – cut,’ Ronald_Weasley panted, as they climbed their seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing, where there was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall. ‘i think it’s this way,’ said Hermione_Granger, peering down the empty passage to the right. ‘can’t be,’ said Ronald_Weasley ‘that’s south. look, you can see a bit of the lake out of the window …’ Harry_Potter was watching the painting. a fat, dapple-grey pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly. Harry_Potter was used to the subjects of hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit each other, but he always enjoyed watching them. a moment later, a short, squat Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead in a suit of armour had clanked into the picture after his pony. by the look of the grass stains on his metal knees, he had just fallen off. ‘aha!’ he yelled, seeing Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger. ‘what villains are these that trespass upon my private lands? come to scorn at my fall, perchance? draw, you knaves, you dogs!’ they watched in astonishment as the little Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and down in rage. but the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he landed face down in the grass. ‘are you all right?’ said Harry_Potter, moving closer to the picture. ‘get back, you scurvy braggart! back, you rogue!’ the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he couldn’t get it out again. finally he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face. ‘listen,’ said Harry_Potter, taking advantage of the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead’s exhaustion, ‘we’re looking for the north tower. you don’t know the way, do you?’ ‘a quest!’ the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead’s rage seemed to vanish instantly. he clanked to his feet and shouted, ‘come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!’ he gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat pony, and cried, ‘on foot then, good sirs and gentle lady! on! on!’ and he ran, clanking loudly, into the left-hand side of the frame and out of sight. they hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his armour. every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead. ‘be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!’ yelled the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead, and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase. puffing loudly, Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger climbed the tightly spiralling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them, and knew they had reached the classroom. ‘farewell!’ cried the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead, popping his head into a painting of some sinister-looking monks. ‘farewell, my comrades-in-arms! if ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon sir Cadogan!’ ‘yeah, we’ll call you,’ muttered Ronald_Weasley as the Knight_with_an_arrow_sticking_out_of_his_forehead disappeared, ‘if we ever need someone mental.’ they climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where most of the class was already assembled. there were no doors off this landing; Ronald_Weasley nudged Harry_Potter and pointed at the ceiling, where there was a circular trap door with a brass plaque on it. ‘Sybill_Trelawney, divination teacher,’ Harry_Potter read. ‘how’re we supposed to get up there?’ as though in answer to his question, the trap door suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry_Potter’s feet. everyone went quiet. ‘after you,’ said Ronald_Weasley grinning, so Harry_Potter climbed the ladder first. he emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. in fact, it didn’t look like a classroom at all; more like a cross between someone’s attic and an old-fashioned teashop. at least twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little pouffes. everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. it was stiflingly warm, and the fire which was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. the shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls and a huge array of teacups. ron appeared at Harry_Potter’s shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers. ‘where is she?’ Ronald_Weasley said. a voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice. ‘welcome,’ it said. ‘how nice to see you in the physical world at last.’ Harry_Potter’s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. professor Sybill_Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings. ‘sit, my children, sit,’ she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto pouffes. Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger sat themselves around the same round table. ‘welcome to divination,’ said professor Sybill_Trelawney, who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. ‘my name is professor Sybill_Trelawney. you may not have seen me before. i find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my inner eye.’ nobody said anything in answer to this extraordinary pronouncement. professor Sybill_Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, ‘so you have chosen to study divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. i must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the sight, there is very little i will be able to teach you. books can take you only so far in this field …’ at these words, both Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley glanced, grinning, at Hermione_Granger, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn’t be much help in this subject. ‘many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future,’ professor Sybill_Trelawney went on, her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. ‘it is a gift granted to few. you, boy,’ she said suddenly to Neville_Longbottom, who almost toppled off his pouffe, ‘is your grandmother well?’ ‘i think so,’ said Neville_Longbottom tremulously. ‘i wouldn’t be so sure if i were you, dear,’ said professor Sybill_Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville_Longbottom gulped. professor Sybill_Trelawney continued placidly, ‘we will be covering the basic methods of divination this year. the first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves. next term we shall progress to palmistry. by the way, my dear,’ she shot suddenly at Parvati_Patil, ‘beware a red-haired man.’ Parvati_Patil gave a startled look at Ronald_Weasley who was right behind her, and edged her chair away from him. ‘in the summer term,’ professor Sybill_Trelawney went on, ‘we shall progress to the crystal ball – if we have finished with fire-omens, that is. unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in february by a nasty bout of flu. i myself will lose my voice. and around easter, one of our number will leave us for ever.’ a very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but professor Sybill_Trelawney seemed unaware of it. ‘i wonder, dear,’ she said to Lavender_Brown, who was nearest and shrank back in her chair, ‘if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?’ Lavender_Brown, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the shelf and put it down on the table in front of professor Sybill_Trelawney. ‘thank you, my dear. incidentally, that thing you are dreading – it will happen on friday the sixteenth of october.’ Lavender_Brown trembled. ‘now, i want you all to divide into pairs. collect a teacup from the shelf, come to me and i will fill it. then sit down and drink; drink until only the dregs remain. swill these around the cup three times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside-down on its saucer; wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to read. you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of unfogging the future. i shall move among you, helping and instructing. oh, and dear –’ she caught Neville_Longbottom by the arm as he made to stand up, ‘after you’ve broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? i’m rather attached to the pink.’ sure enough, Neville_Longbottom had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups than there was a tinkle of breaking china. professor Sybill_Trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said, ‘one of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn’t mind … thank you …’ when Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley had had their teacups filled, they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. they swilled the dregs around as professor Sybill_Trelawney had instructed, then drained the cups and swapped them. ‘right,’ said Ronald_Weasley as they both opened their books at pages five and six. ‘what can you see in mine?’ ‘a load of soggy brown stuff,’ said Harry_Potter. the heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid. ‘broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the mundane!’ professor Sybill_Trelawney cried through the gloom. Harry_Potter tried to pull himself together. ‘right, you’ve got a wonky sort of cross …’ he said, consulting unfogging the future. ‘that means you’re going to have “trials and suffering” – sorry about that – but there’s a thing that could be the sun. hang on … that means “great happiness” … so you’re going to suffer but be very happy …’ ‘you need your inner eye testing, if you ask me,’ said Ronald_Weasley and they both had to stifle their laughs as professor Sybill_Trelawney gazed in their direction. ‘my turn …’ Ronald_Weasley peered into Harry_Potter’s teacup, his forehead wrinkled with effort. ‘there’s a blob a bit like a bowler hat,’ he said. ‘maybe you’re going to work for the ministry of magic …’ he turned the teacup the other way up. ‘but this way it looks more like an acorn … what’s that?’ he scanned his copy of unfogging the future. ‘“a windfall, unexpected gold.” excellent, you can lend me some. and there’s a thing here,’ he turned the cup again, ‘that looks like an animal. yeah, if that was its head … it looks like a hippo … no, a sheep …’ professor Sybill_Trelawney whirled around as Harry_Potter let out a snort of laughter. ‘let me see that, my dear,’ she said reprovingly to Ronald_Weasley sweeping over and snatching Harry_Potter’s cup from him. everyone went quiet to watch. professor Sybill_Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it anti-clockwise. ‘the falcon … my dear, you have a deadly enemy.’ ‘but everyone knows that,’ said Hermione_Granger in a loud whisper. professor Sybill_Trelawney stared at her. ‘well, they do,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘everybody knows about Harry_Potter and you- know-who.’ Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration. they had never heard Hermione_Granger speak to a teacher like that before. professor Sybill_Trelawney chose not to reply. she lowered her huge eyes to Harry_Potter’s cup again and continued to turn it. ‘the club … an attack. dear, dear, this is not a happy cup …’ ‘i thought that was a bowler hat,’ said Ronald_Weasley sheepishly. ‘the skull … danger in your path, my dear …’ everyone was staring, transfixed, at professor Sybill_Trelawney, who gave the cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed. there was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville_Longbottom had smashed his second cup. professor Sybill_Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed. ‘my dear boy – my poor dear boy – no – it is kinder not to say – no – don’t ask me …’ ‘what is it, professor?’ said Dean_Thomas at once. everyone had got to their feet, and slowly, they crowded around Harry_Potter and ron’s table, pressing close to professor Sybill_Trelawney’s chair to get a good look at Harry_Potter’s cup. ‘my dear,’ professor Sybill_Trelawney’s huge eyes opened dramatically, ‘you have the grim.’ ‘the what?’ said Harry_Potter. he could tell that he wasn’t the only one who didn’t understand; Dean_Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender_Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror. ‘the grim, my dear, the grim!’ cried professor Sybill_Trelawney, who looked shocked that Harry_Potter hadn’t understood. ‘the giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! my dear boy, it is an omen – the worst omen – of death!’ Harry_Potter’s stomach lurched. that dog on the cover of death omens in flourish and blotts – the dog in the shadows of magnolia crescent … Lavender_Brown clapped her hands to her mouth, too. everyone was looking at Harry_Potter; everyone except Hermione_Granger, who had got up and moved around to the back of professor Sybill_Trelawney’s chair. ‘i don’t think it looks like a grim,’ she said flatly. professor Sybill_Trelawney surveyed Hermione_Granger with mounting dislike. ‘you’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but i Percy_Weasleyive very little aura around you. very little receptivity to the resonances of the future.’ Seamus_Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side. ‘it looks like a grim if you do this,’ he said, with his eyes almost shut, ‘but it looks more like a donkey from here,’ he said, leaning to the left. ‘when you’ve all finished deciding whether i’m going to die or not!’ said Harry_Potter, taking even himself by surprise. now nobody seemed to want to look at him. ‘i think we will leave the lesson here for today,’ said professor Sybill_Trelawney, in her mistiest voice. ‘yes … please pack away your things …’ silently the class took their teacups back to professor Sybill_Trelawney, packed away their books and closed their bags. even Ronald_Weasley was avoiding Harry_Potter’s eyes. ‘until we meet again,’ said professor Sybill_Trelawney faintly, ‘fair fortune be yours. oh, and dear –’ she pointed at Neville_Longbottom, ‘you’ll be late next time, so mind you work extra hard to catch up.’ Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger descended professor Sybill_Trelawney’s ladder and the winding staircase in silence, then set off for professor Minerva_McGonagall’s transfiguration lesson. it took them so long to find her classroom that, early as they had left divination, they were only just in time. Harry_Potter chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he was sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him, as though he was about to drop dead at any moment. he hardly heard what professor Minerva_McGonagall was telling them about animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and wasn’t even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes. ‘really, what has got into you all today?’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, turning back into herself with a faint pop, and staring around at them all. ‘not that it matters, but that’s the first time my transformation’s not got applause from a class.’ everybody’s heads turned towards Harry_Potter again, but nobody spoke. then Hermione_Granger raised her hand. ‘please, professor, we’ve just had our first divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and –’ ‘ah, of course,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, suddenly frowning. ‘there is no need to say any more, miss granger. tell me, which of you will be dying this year?’ everyone stared at her. ‘me,’ said Harry_Potter, finally. ‘i see,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, fixing Harry_Potter with her beady eyes. ‘then you should know, potter, that Sybill_Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. none of them has died yet. seeing death omens is her favourite way of greeting a new class. if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of my colleagues –’ professor Minerva_McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone white. she went on, more calmly, ‘divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. i shall not conceal from you that i have very little patience with it. true seers are very rare, and professor Sybill_Trelawney …’ she stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, ‘you look in excellent health to me, potter, so you will excuse me if i don’t let you off homework today. i assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in.’ Hermione_Granger laughed. Harry_Potter felt a bit better. it was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of professor Sybill_Trelawney’s classroom. not everyone was convinced, however. Ronald_Weasley still looked worried, and Lavender_Brown whispered, ‘but what about Neville_Longbottom’s cup?’ when the transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd thundering towards the great hall for lunch. ‘ron, cheer up,’ said Hermione_Granger, pushing a dish of stew towards him. ‘you heard what professor Minerva_McGonagall said.’ Ronald_Weasley spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn’t start. ‘Harry_Potter,’ he said, in a low, serious voice, ‘you haven’t seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?’ ‘yeah, i have,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘i saw one the night i left Vernon_Dursley and Petunia_Dursley.’ Ronald_Weasley let his fork fall with a clatter. ‘probably a stray,’ said Hermione_Granger calmly. Ronald_Weasley looked at Hermione_Granger as though she had gone mad. ‘Hermione_Granger, if Harry_Potter’s seen a grim, that’s – that’s bad,’ he said. ‘my – my uncle bilius saw one and – and he died twenty-four hours later!’ ‘coincidence,’ said Hermione_Granger airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice. ‘you don’t know what you’re talking about!’ said Ronald_Weasley starting to get angry. ‘grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!’ ‘there you are, then,’ said Hermione_Granger in a superior tone. ‘they see the grim and die of fright. the grim’s not an omen, it’s the cause of death! and Harry_Potter’s still with us because he’s not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, i’d better pop my clogs then!’ Ronald_Weasley mouthed wordlessly at Hermione_Granger, who opened her bag, took out her new arithmancy book and propped it open against the juice jug. ‘i think divination seems very woolly,’ she said, searching for her page. ‘a lot of guesswork, if you ask me.’ ‘there was nothing woolly about the grim in that cup!’ said Ronald_Weasley hotly. ‘you didn’t seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry_Potter it was a sheep,’ said Hermione_Granger coolly. ‘professor Sybill_Trelawney said you didn’t have the right aura! you just don’t like being rubbish at something for a change!’ he had touched a nerve. Hermione_Granger slammed her arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere. ‘if being good at divination means i have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, i’m not sure i’ll be studying it much longer! that lesson was absolute rubbish compared to my arithmancy class!’ she snatched up her bag and stalked away. Ronald_Weasley frowned after her. ‘what’s she talking about?’ he said to Harry_Potter. ‘she hasn’t been to an arithmancy class yet.’ * Harry_Potter was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. yesterday’s rain had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale grey and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever care of magical creatures class. Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger weren’t speaking to each other. Harry_Potter walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Rubeus_Hagrid’s hut on the edge of the forbidden forest. it was only when he spotted three only-too- familiar backs ahead of them that he realised they must be having these lessons with the slytherins. malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry_Potter was quite sure he knew what they were talking about. Rubeus_Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. he stood in his moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his heels, looking impatient to start. ‘c’mon, now, get a move on!’ he called, as the class approached. ‘got a real treat for yeh today! great lesson comin’ up! everyone here? right, follow me!’ for one nasty moment, Harry_Potter thought that Rubeus_Hagrid was going to lead them into the forest; Harry_Potter had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime. however, Rubeus_Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of paddock. there was nothing in there. ‘everyone gather round the fence here!’ he called. ‘that’s it – make sure yeh can see. now, firs’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books –’ ‘how?’ said the cold, drawling voice of Draco_Malfoy. ‘eh?’ said Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘how do we open our books?’ malfoy repeated. he took out his copy of the monster book of monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of rope. other people took theirs out, too; some, like Harry_Potter, had belted their book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with bullclips. ‘hasn’ – hasn’ anyone bin able ter open their books?’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, looking crestfallen. the class all shook their heads. ‘yeh’ve got ter stroke ’em,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world. ‘look …’ he took Hermione_Granger’s copy and ripped off the spellotape that bound it. the book tried to bite, but Rubeus_Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand. ‘oh, how silly we’ve all been!’ malfoy sneered. ‘we should have stroked them! why didn’t we guess!’ ‘i … i thought they were funny,’ Rubeus_Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione_Granger. ‘oh, tremendously funny!’ said malfoy. ‘really witty, giving us books that try and rip our hands off!’ ‘shut up, malfoy,’ said Harry_Potter quietly. Rubeus_Hagrid was looking downcast and Harry_Potter wanted Rubeus_Hagrid’s first lesson to be a success. ‘righ’ then,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, ‘so … so yeh’ve got yer books an’ … an’ … now yeh need the magical creatures. yeah. so i’ll go an’ get ’em. hang on …’ he strode away from them into the forest and out of sight. ‘god, this place is going to the dogs,’ said malfoy loudly. ‘that oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a fit when i tell him –’ ‘shut up, malfoy,’ Harry_Potter repeated. ‘careful, potter, there’s a dementor behind you –’ ‘oooooooh!’ squealed Lavender_Brown, pointing towards the opposite side of the paddock. trotting towards them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry_Potter had ever seen. they had the bodies, hind legs and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, steel- coloured beaks and large, brilliantly orange eyes. the talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly-looking. each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of Rubeus_Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures. ‘gee up, there!’ he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures towards the fence where the class stood. everyone drew back slightly as Rubeus_Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence. ‘hippogriffs!’ Rubeus_Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. ‘beau’iful, aren’ they?’ Harry_Potter could sort of see what Rubeus_Hagrid meant. once you had got over the first shock of seeing something that was half-horse, half-bird, you started to appreciate the hippogriffs’ gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different colour: stormy grey, bronze, a pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut and inky black. ‘so,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, ‘if yeh wan’ ter come a bit nearer …’ no one seemed to want to. Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger, however, approached the fence cautiously. ‘now, firs’ thing yeh gotta know abou’ hippogriffs is they’re proud,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘easily offended, hippogriffs are. don’t never insult one, ’cause it might be the last thing yeh do.’ malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle weren’t listening; they were talking in an undertone and Harry_Potter had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson. ‘yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs’ move,’ Rubeus_Hagrid continued. ‘it’s polite, see? yeh walk towards him, and yeh bow, an’ yeh wait. if he bows back, yeh’re allowed ter touch him. if he doesn’ bow, then get away from him sharpish, ’cause those talons hurt.’ ‘right – who wants ter go first?’ most of the class backed further away in answer. even Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger had misgivings. the hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they didn’t seem to like being tethered like this. ‘no one?’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, with a pleading look. ‘i’ll do it,’ said Harry_Potter. there was an intake of breath from behind him and both Lavender_Brown and Parvati_Patil whispered, ‘oooh, no, Harry_Potter, remember your tea leaves!’ Harry_Potter ignored them. he climbed over the paddock fence. ‘good man, Harry_Potter!’ roared Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘right then – let’s see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.’ he untied one of the chains, pulled the grey hippogriff away from his fellows and slipped off his leather collar. the class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. malfoy’s eyes were narrowed maliciously. ‘easy, now, Harry_Potter,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid quietly. ‘yeh’ve got eye contact, now try not ter blink – hippogriffs don’ trust yeh if yeh blink too much …’ Harry_Potter’s eyes immediately began to water, but he didn’t shut them. Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head, and was staring at Harry_Potter with one fierce orange eye. ‘tha’s it,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘tha’s it, Harry_Potter … now, bow …’ Harry_Potter didn’t feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. he gave a short bow and then looked up. the hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. it didn’t move. ‘ah,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, sounding worried. ‘right – back away, now, Harry_Potter, easy does it –’ but then, to Harry_Potter’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent his scaly front knees, and sank into what was an unmistakeable bow. ‘well done, Harry_Potter!’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, ecstatic. ‘right – yeh can touch him! pat his beak, go on!’ feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry_Potter moved slowly towards the hippogriff and reached out towards him. he patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed his eyes lazily, as though enjoying it. the class broke into applause, all except for malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, who were looking deeply disappointed. ‘righ’ then, Harry_Potter,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, ‘i reckon he migh’ let yeh ride him!’ this was more than Harry_Potter had bargained for. he was used to a broomstick; but he wasn’t sure a hippogriff would be quite the same. ‘yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, ‘an’ mind yeh don’ pull any of his feathers out, he won’ like that …’ Harry_Potter put his foot on the top of Buckbeak’s wing and hoisted himself onto his back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry_Potter wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything in front of him was covered in feathers. ‘go on, then!’ roared Rubeus_Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s hindquarters. without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry_Potter; he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upwards. it was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry_Potter knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff’s wings were beating uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn’t dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his nimbus two thousand, he now felt himself rocking backwards and forwards as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with his wings. Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit Harry_Potter had been dreading; he leant back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak; then he felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground, and just managed to hold on and push himself straight again. ‘good work, Harry_Potter!’ roared Rubeus_Hagrid, as everyone except malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle cheered. ‘ok, who else wants a go?’ emboldened by Harry_Potter’s success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock. Rubeus_Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville_Longbottom ran repeatedly backwards from his, which didn’t seem to want to bend its knees. Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger practised on the chestnut, while Harry_Potter watched. malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. he had bowed to malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful. ‘this is very easy,’ malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry_Potter to hear him. ‘i knew it must have been, if potter could do it … i bet you’re not dangerous at all, are you?’ he said to the hippogriff. ‘are you, you ugly great brute?’ it happened in a flash of steely talons; malfoy let out a high-pitched scream and next moment, Rubeus_Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes. ‘i’m dying!’ malfoy yelled, as the class paNicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoned. ‘i’m dying, look at me! it’s killed me!’ ‘yer not dyin’!’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, who had gone very white. ‘someone help me – gotta get him outta here –’ Hermione_Granger ran to open the gate while Rubeus_Hagrid lifted malfoy easily. as they passed, Harry_Potter saw that there was a long, deep gash in malfoy’s arm; blood splattered the grass and Rubeus_Hagrid ran with him, up the slope towards the castle. very shaken, the care of magical creatures class followed at a walk. the slytherins were all shouting about Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘they should sack him straight away!’ said Pansy_Parkinson, who was in tears. ‘it was malfoy’s fault!’ snapped Dean_Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly. they all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall. ‘i’m going to see if he’s ok!’ said Pansy_Parkinson, and they all watched her run up the marble staircase. the slytherins, still muttering about Rubeus_Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their Mundungus_Fletchereon common room; Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger proceeded upstairs to gryffindor tower. ‘d’you think he’ll be all right?’ said Hermione_Granger nervously. ‘’course he will, madam pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,’ said Harry_Potter, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the matron. ‘that was a really bad thing to happen in Rubeus_Hagrid’s first class, though, wasn’t it?’ said Ronald_Weasley looking worried. ‘trust malfoy to mess things up for him …’ they were among the first to reach the great hall at dinner-time, hoping to see Rubeus_Hagrid, but he wasn’t there. ‘they wouldn’t sack him, would they?’ said Hermione_Granger anxiously, not touching her steak-and-kidney pudding. ‘they’d better not,’ said Ronald_Weasley who wasn’t eating either. Harry_Potter was watching the slytherin table. a large group including Crabbe and Goyle were huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry_Potter was sure they were Cook_of_The_Hanged_Maning up their own version of how malfoy had got injured. ‘well, you can’t say it wasn’t an interesting first day back,’ said Ronald_Weasley gloomily. they went up to the crowded gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework professor Minerva_McGonagall had set them, but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window. ‘there’s a light on in Rubeus_Hagrid’s window,’ Harry_Potter said suddenly. Ronald_Weasley looked at his watch. ‘if we hurried, we could go down and see him, it’s still quite early …’ ‘i don’t know,’ Hermione_Granger said slowly, and Harry_Potter saw her glance at him. ‘i’m allowed to walk across the grounds,’ he said pointedly. ‘Sirius_Black hasn’t got past the dementors here, has he?’ so they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad not to meet anybody on their way to the front doors, as they weren’t entirely sure they were supposed to be out. the grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. when they reached Rubeus_Hagrid’s hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, ‘c’min.’ Rubeus_Hagrid was sitting in his shirt-sleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in Rubeus_Hagrid’s lap. one look told them that Rubeus_Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty in getting them into focus. ‘’spect it’s a record,’ he said thickly, when he recognised them. ‘don’ reckon they’ve ever had a teacher who on’y lasted a day before.’ ‘you haven’t been sacked, Rubeus_Hagrid!’ gasped Hermione_Granger. ‘not yet,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard. ‘but ’s only a matter o’ time, i’n’t it, after malfoy …’ ‘how is he?’ said Ronald_Weasley as they all sat down. ‘it wasn’t serious, was it?’ ‘madam pomfrey fixed him best she could,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid dully, ‘but he’s sayin’ it’s still agony … covered in bandages … moanin’ …’ ‘he’s faking it,’ said Harry_Potter at once. ‘madam pomfrey can mend anything. she regrew half my bones last year. trust malfoy to milk it for all it’s worth.’ ‘school gov’nors have bin told, o’ course,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid miserably. ‘they reckon i started too big. shoulda left hippogriffs fer later … done flobberworms or summat … jus’ thought it’d make a good firs’ lesson … ’s all my fault …’ ‘it’s all malfoy’s fault, Rubeus_Hagrid!’ said Hermione_Granger earnestly. ‘we’re witnesses,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘you said hippogriffs attack if you insult them. it’s malfoy’s problem he wasn’t listening. we’ll tell Albus_Dumbledore what really happened.’ ‘yeah, don’t worry, Rubeus_Hagrid, we’ll back you up,’ said Ronald_Weasley tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Rubeus_Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes. he grabbed both Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug. ‘i think you’ve had enough to drink, Rubeus_Hagrid,’ said Hermione_Granger firmly. she took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it. ‘ar, maybe she’s right,’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, letting go of Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Rubeus_Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed Hermione_Granger unsteadily outside. they heard a loud splash. ‘what’s he done?’ said Harry_Potter nervously, as Hermione_Granger came back in with the empty tankard. ‘stuck his head in the water barrel,’ said Hermione_Granger, putting the tankard away. Rubeus_Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water out of his eyes. ‘tha’s better,’ he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all. ‘listen, it was good of yeh ter come an’ see me, i really –’ Rubeus_Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry_Potter as though he’d only just realised he was there. ‘what d’yeh think you’re doin’, eh?’ he roared, so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air. ‘yeh’re not to go wanderin’ around after dark, Harry_Potter! an’ you two! lettin’ him!’ Rubeus_Hagrid strode over to Harry_Potter, grabbed his arm and pulled him to the door. ‘c’mon!’ Rubeus_Hagrid said angrily. ‘i’m takin’ yer all back up ter school, an’ don’ let me catch yeh walkin’ down ter see me after dark again. i’m not worth that!’
