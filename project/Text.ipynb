    "# Sentiment Analysis\n",
    ">We want to be able to analyse the sentiment of a character throughout the books. Our idea for achieving this is to use concordance from nltk with the character name, this way we will get all of the context surrounding a character. For each of these occurrences we can compute the sentiment for the context, and use that sentiment as a representative for the character. This could be done on occurence basis, but since we are expecting to have many occurences how harry, and fewer for other main characters, and even less for the remaining characters, this would require additional steps to normalize the results."
