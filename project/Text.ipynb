Looking at the graphs we can see that there are similar trends for Harry throughout the book, but with VADER the sentiment becomes more consistent, in that it appears to be in the neutral region at some points, and then go out of it. On the other hand the MatLab1.0 seems to indicate that Harry is well above 5.1 throughout the book, which we would consider to be above neutral. Based on this preliminary test we believe that we will get a more clear picture from VADER."
