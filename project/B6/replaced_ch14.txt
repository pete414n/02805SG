— chapter fourteen — felix felicis Harry_Potter had herbology first thing the following morning. he had been unable to tell Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger about his lesson with Albus_Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch towards the greenhouses. the weekend’s brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse. ‘wow, scary thought, the boy Tom_Riddle,’ said Ronald_Weasley quietly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled snargaluff stumps that formed that term’s project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. ‘but i still don’t get why Albus_Dumbledore’s showing you all this. i mean, it’s really interesting and everything, but what’s the point?’ ‘dunno,’ said Harry_Potter, inserting a gum shield. ‘but he says it’s all important and it’ll help me survive.’ ‘i think it’s fascinating,’ said Hermione_Granger earnestly. ‘it makes absolute sense to know as much about voldemort as possible. how else will you find out his weaknesses?’ ‘so how was slughorn’s latest party?’ Harry_Potter asked her thickly through the gum shield. ‘oh, it was quite fun, really,’ said Hermione_Granger, now putting on protective goggles. ‘i mean, he drones on about famous ex-pupils a bit, and he absolutely fawns on mclaggen because he’s so well-connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to gwenog jones.’ ‘gwenog jones?’ said Ronald_Weasley his eyes widening under his own goggles. ‘the gwenog jones? captain of the holyhead harpies?’ ‘that’s right,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘personally, i thought she was a bit full of herself, but –’ ‘quite enough chat over here!’ said professor sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern. ‘you’re lagging behind, everybody else has started and Neville_Longbottom’s already got his first pod!’    they looked round; sure enough, there sat Neville_Longbottom with a Bloody_Baron lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit. ‘ok, professor, we’re starting now!’ said Ronald_Weasley adding quietly, when she had turned away again, ‘should’ve used muffliato, Harry_Potter.’ ‘no, we shouldn’t!’ said Hermione_Granger at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Severus_Snape and his spells. ‘well, come on … we’d better get going …’ she gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them. it sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramble-like vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. one tangled itself in Hermione_Granger’s hair and Ronald_Weasley beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Harry_Potter succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and kNotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentacle-like branches; Hermione_Granger plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again and Hermione_Granger snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like Neville_Longbottom’s. at once, the prickly vines shot back inside and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood. ‘you know, i don’t think i’ll be having any of these in my garden when i’ve got my own place,’ said Ronald_Weasley pushing his goggles up on to his forehead and wiping sweat from his face. ‘pass me a bowl,’ said Hermione_Granger, holding the pulsating pod at arm’s length; Harry_Potter handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face. ‘don’t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they’re best when they’re fresh!’ called professor sprout. ‘anyway,’ said Hermione_Granger, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, ‘slughorn’s going to have a christmas party, Harry_Potter, and there’s no way you’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.’ Harry_Potter groaned. Ronald_Weasley meanwhile, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, ‘and this is another party just for slughorn’s favourites, is it?’ ‘just for the slug club, yes,’ said Hermione_Granger. the pod flew out from under ron’s fingers and hit the greenhouse glass, rebounding on to the back of professor sprout’s head and knocking off her old patched hat. Harry_Potter went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione_Granger was saying, ‘look, i didn’t make up the name “slug club” –’ ‘“slug club”,’ repeated Ronald_Weasley with a sneer worthy of malfoy. ‘it’s pathetic. well, i Hope_Howell you enjoy your party. why don’t you try getting off with mclaggen, then slughorn can make you king and queen slug –’ ‘we’re allowed to bring guests,’ said Hermione_Granger, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, ‘and i was going to ask you to come, but if you think it’s that stupid then i won’t bother!’ Harry_Potter suddenly wished the pod had flown a little further, so that he need not have been sitting there with the pair of them. unnoticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of their conversation. ‘you were going to ask me?’ asked Ronald_Weasley in a completely different voice. ‘yes,’ said Hermione_Granger angrily. ‘but obviously if you’d rather i got off with mclaggen …’ there was a pause while Harry_Potter continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel. ‘no, i wouldn’t,’ said Ronald_Weasley in a very quiet voice. Harry_Potter missed the pod, hit the bowl and it shattered. ‘reparo,’ he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. the crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger to Harry_Potter’s presence. Hermione_Granger looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of flesh-eating trees of the world to find out the correct way to juice snargaluff pods; Ronald_Weasley on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself. ‘hand that over, Harry_Potter,’ said Hermione_Granger hurriedly, ‘it says we’re supposed to puncture them with something sharp …’ Harry_Potter passed her the pod in the bowl, he and Ronald_Weasley both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump. it was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry_Potter, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. but he was not sure how he felt about it … he and Cho_Chang were now too embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger started going out together, then split up? could their friendship survive it? Harry_Potter remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. and then, what if they didn’t split up? what if they became like William_Weasley and Fleur_Delacour, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good? ‘gotcha!’ yelled Ronald_Weasley pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione_Granger managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms. the rest of the lesson passed without further mention of slughorn’s party. although Harry_Potter watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry_Potter supposed he would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in slughorn’s dimly lit room on the night of the party. in the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries. Katie_Bell was still in st mungo’s hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising gryffindor team Harry_Potter had been training so carefully since september was one chaser short. he kept putting off replacing Katie_Bell in the Hope_Howell that she would return, but their opening match against slytherin was looming and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play. Harry_Potter did not think he could stand another full-house tryout. with a sinking feeling that had little to do with quidditch, he cornered Dean_Thomas after transfiguration one day. most of the class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Hermione_Granger’s creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air. ‘are you still interested in playing chaser?’ ‘wha—? yeah, of course!’ said Dean_Thomas excitedly. over Dean_Thomas’s shoulder Harry_Potter saw Seamus_Finnigan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. one of the reasons why Harry_Potter would have preferred not to have to ask Dean_Thomas to play was that he knew Seamus_Finnigan would not like it. on the other hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean_Thomas had out-flown Seamus_Finnigan at the tryouts. ‘well then, you’re in,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘there’s a practice tonight, seven o’clock.’ ‘right,’ said Dean_Thomas. ‘cheers, Harry_Potter! blimey, i can’t wait to tell Ginevra_Weasley!’ he sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry_Potter and Seamus_Finnigan alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamus_Finnigan’s head as one of Hermione_Granger’s canaries whizzed over them. Seamus_Finnigan was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katie_Bell’s substitute. there was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry_Potter had now chosen two of his classmates for the team. as Harry_Potter had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against slytherin. if gryffindor won, Harry_Potter knew that the whole house would forget that they had criticised him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. if they lost … well, Harry_Potter thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings … Harry_Potter had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean_Thomas fly that evening; he worked well with Ginevra_Weasley and Demelza_Robins. the beaters, peakes and coote, were getting better all the time. the only problem was Ronald_Weasley Harry_Potter had known all along that Ronald_Weasley was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. after letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginevra_Weasley, his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza_Robins in the mouth. ‘it was an accident, i’m sorry, Demelza_Robins, really sorry!’ Ronald_Weasley shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground dripping blood everywhere. ‘i just –’ ‘paNicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoned,’ Ginevra_Weasley said angrily, landing next to Demelza_Robins and examining her fat lip. ‘you prat, Ronald_Weasley look at the state of her!’ ‘i can fix that,’ said Harry_Potter, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelza_Robins’s mouth and saying ‘episkey’. ‘and Ginevra_Weasley, don’t call Ronald_Weasley a prat, you’re not the captain of this team –’ ‘well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and i thought someone should –’ Harry_Potter forced himself not to laugh. ‘in the air, everyone, let’s go …’ overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, though Harry_Potter did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match. ‘good work, everyone, i think we’ll flatten slytherin,’ he said bracingly, and the chasers and beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves. ‘i played like a sack of dragon Mundungus_Fletcher,’ said Ronald_Weasley in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind Ginevra_Weasley. ‘no you didn’t,’ said Harry_Potter firmly. ‘you’re the best keeper i tried out, Ronald_Weasley your only problem is nerves.’ he kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor Ronald_Weasley was looking marginally more cheerful. when Harry_Potter pushed open the tapestry to take their usual short cut up to gryffindor tower, however, they found themselves looking at Dean_Thomas and Ginevra_Weasley, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as if glued together. it was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harry_Potter’s stomach, clawing at his insides: hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean_Thomas into a jelly. wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard ron’s voice as though from a great distance away. ‘oi!’ Dean_Thomas and Ginevra_Weasley broke apart and looked round. ‘what?’ said Ginevra_Weasley. ‘i don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!’ ‘this was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!’ said Ginevra_Weasley. Dean_Thomas was looking embarrassed. he gave Harry_Potter a shifty grin that Harry_Potter did not return, as the new-born monster inside him was roaring for Dean_Thomas’s instant dismissal from the team. ‘er … c’mon, Ginevra_Weasley,’ said Dean_Thomas, ‘let’s go back to the common room …’ ‘you go!’ said Ginevra_Weasley. ‘i want a word with my dear brother!’ Dean_Thomas left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene. ‘right,’ said Ginevra_Weasley, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ronald_Weasley ‘let’s get this straight once and for all. it is none of your business who i go out with or what i do with them, Ronald_Weasley –’ ‘yeah, it is!’ said Ronald_Weasley just as angrily. ‘d’you think i want people saying my sister’s a –’ ‘a what?’ shouted Ginevra_Weasley, drawing her wand. ‘a what, exactly?’ ‘he doesn’t mean anything, Ginevra_Weasley –’ said Harry_Potter automatically, though the monster was roaring its approval of ron’s words. ‘oh yes he does!’ she said, flaring up at Harry_Potter. ‘just because he’s never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he’s ever had is from our auntie Muriel –’ ‘shut your mouth!’ bellowed Ronald_Weasley bypassing red and turning maroon. ‘no, i will not!’ yelled Ginevra_Weasley, beside herself. ‘i’ve seen you with Fleur_Delacour, hoping she’ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, it’s pathetic! if you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself you wouldn’t mind so much that everyone else does it!’ Ronald_Weasley had pulled out his wand too; Harry_Potter stepped swiftly between them. ‘you don’t know what you’re talking about!’ Ronald_Weasley roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginevra_Weasley around Harry_Potter, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. ‘just because i don’t do it in public –!’ Ginevra_Weasley screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry_Potter out of the way. ‘been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? or have you got a picture of auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?’ ‘you –’ a streak of orange light flew under Harry_Potter’s left arm and missed Ginevra_Weasley by inches; Harry_Potter pushed Ronald_Weasley up against the wall. ‘don’t be stupid –’ ‘Harry_Potter’s snogged Cho_Chang!’ shouted Ginevra_Weasley, who sounded close to tears now. ‘and Hermione_Granger snogged Viktor_Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something disgusting, Ronald_Weasley and that’s because you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!’ and with that, she stormed away. Harry_Potter quickly let go of ron; the look on his face was murderous. they both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs_Norris, filch’s cat, appeared round the corner, which broke the tension. ‘c’mon,’ said Harry_Potter, as the sound of filch’s shuffling feet reached their ears. they hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. ‘oi, out of the way!’ Ronald_Weasley barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toad-spawn. Harry_Potter hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt disorientated, dizzy; being struck by a Harry_Potter bolt must be something like this. it’s just because she’s ron’s sister, he told himself. you just didn’t like seeing her kissing Dean_Thomas because she’s ron’s sister … but unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginevra_Weasley instead … the monster in his chest purred … but then he saw Ronald_Weasley ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry_Potter, shouting things like ‘betrayal of trust’ … ‘supposed to be my friend’ … ‘d’you think Hermione_Granger did snog krum?’ Ronald_Weasley asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat_Lady. Harry_Potter gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ronald_Weasley intruded, in which he and Ginevra_Weasley were quite alone – ‘what?’ he said confusedly. ‘oh … er …’ the honest answer was ‘yes’, but he did not want to give it. however, Ronald_Weasley seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry_Potter’s face. ‘dilligrout,’ he said darkly to the Fat_Lady, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room. neither of them mentioned Ginevra_Weasley or Hermione_Granger again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts. Harry_Potter lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginevra_Weasley were entirely older- brotherly. they had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, playing quidditch, teasing Ronald_Weasley and having a laugh about William_Weasley and Fleur_Delacour? he had known Ginevra_Weasley for years now … it was natural that he should feel protective … natural that he should want to look out for her … want to rip Dean_Thomas limb from limb for kissing her … no … he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling … Ronald_Weasley gave a great grunting snore. she’s ron’s sister, Harry_Potter told himself firmly. ron’s sister. she’s out of bounds. he would not risk his friendship with Ronald_Weasley for anything. he punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginevra_Weasley. Harry_Potter awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ronald_Weasley had chased him with a beater’s bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ronald_Weasley for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginevra_Weasley and Dean_Thomas, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione_Granger with an icy, sneering indifference. what was more, Ronald_Weasley seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended_Skrewt. Harry_Potter spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger with no success: finally, Hermione_Granger departed for bed in high dudgeon and Ronald_Weasley stalked off to the boys’ dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first-years for looking at him. to Harry_Potter’s dismay, ron’s new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the final quidditch practice before saturday’s match, he failed to save every single goal the chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza_Robins to tears. ‘you shut up and leave her alone!’ shouted peakes, who was about two- thirds ron’s height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat. ‘enough!’ bellowed Harry_Potter, who had seen Ginevra_Weasley glowering in ron’s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the bat-bogey hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand. ‘peakes, go and pack up the bludgers. Demelza_Robins, pull yourself together, you played really well today. Ronald_Weasley …’ he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, ‘you’re my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and i’m going to kick you off the team.’ he really thought for a moment that Ronald_Weasley might hit him, but then something much worse happened: Ronald_Weasley seemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of him and he said, ‘i resign. i’m pathetic.’ ‘you’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!’ said Harry_Potter fiercely, seizing Ronald_Weasley by the front of his robes. ‘you can save anything when you’re on form, it’s a mental problem you’ve got!’ ‘you calling me mental?’ ‘yeah, maybe i am!’ they glared at each other for a moment, then Ronald_Weasley shook his head wearily. ‘i know you haven’t got any time to find another keeper, so i’ll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, i’m taking myself off the team.’ nothing Harry_Potter said made any difference. he tried boosting ron’s confidence all through dinner, but Ronald_Weasley was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione_Granger to notice. Harry_Potter persisted in the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ronald_Weasley left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ronald_Weasley and casting him nasty looks. finally, Harry_Potter tried getting angry again in the Hope_Howell of provoking Ronald_Weasley into a defiant, and Hope_Howellfully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; Ronald_Weasley went to bed as dejected and Hope_Howellless as ever. Harry_Potter lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. he did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as captain, but he was determined to beat Draco_Malfoy at quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. yet if Ronald_Weasley played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim … if only there was something he could do to make Ronald_Weasley pull himself together … make him play at the top of his form … something that would ensure that Ronald_Weasley had a really good day … and the answer came to Harry_Potter in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration. breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the gryffindor team entered the great hall. Harry_Potter glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen. the gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley approached. Harry_Potter grinned and waved; Ronald_Weasley grimaced weakly and shook his head. ‘cheer up, Ronald_Weasley’ called Lavender_Brown. ‘i know you’ll be brilliant!’ Ronald_Weasley ignored her. ‘tea?’ Harry_Potter asked him. ‘coffee? pumpkin juice?’ ‘anything,’ said Ronald_Weasley glumly, taking a moody bite of toast. a few minutes later Hermione_Granger, who had become so tired of ron’s recent unpleasant behaviour that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table. ‘how are you both feeling?’ she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of ron’s head. ‘fine,’ said Harry_Potter, who was concentrating on handing Ronald_Weasley a glass of pumpkin juice. ‘there you go, Ronald_Weasley drink up.’ Ronald_Weasley had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione_Granger spoke sharply. ‘don’t drink that, Ronald_Weasley’ both Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley looked up at her. ‘why not?’ said Ronald_Weasley Hermione_Granger was now staring at Harry_Potter as though she could not believe her eyes. ‘you just put something in that drink.’ ‘excuse me?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘you heard me. i saw you. you just tipped something into ron’s drink. you’ve got the bottle in your hand right now!’ ‘i don’t know what you’re talking about,’ said Harry_Potter, stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket. ‘ron, i warn you, don’t drink it!’ Hermione_Granger said again, alarmed, but Ronald_Weasley picked up the glass, drained it in one and said, ‘stop bossing me around, Hermione_Granger.’ she looked scandalised. bending low so that only Harry_Potter could hear her she hissed, ‘you should be expelled for that. i’d never have believed it of you, Harry_Potter!’ ‘hark who’s talking,’ he whispered back. ‘confunded anyone lately?’ she stormed up the table away from them. Harry_Potter watched her go without regret. Hermione_Granger had never really understood what a serious business quidditch was. he then looked round at Ronald_Weasley who was smacking his lips. ‘nearly time,’ said Harry_Potter blithely. the frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium. ‘pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?’ Harry_Potter asked Ronald_Weasley ‘yeah,’ said Ronald_Weasley who was pale and sick-looking. Ginevra_Weasley and Demelza_Robins were already wearing their quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room. ‘conditions look ideal,’ said Ginevra_Weasley, ignoring Ronald_Weasley ‘and guess what? that slytherin chaser Vaisey – he took a bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he’s too sore to play! and even better than that – malfoy’s gone off sick too!’ ‘what?’ said Harry_Potter, wheeling round to stare at her. ‘he’s ill? what’s wrong with him?’ ‘no idea, but it’s great for us,’ said Ginevra_Weasley brightly. ‘they’re playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and he’s an idiot.’ Harry_Potter smiled vaguely back, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from quidditch. malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the slytherins better. why was he now happy to let a substitute go on? was he really ill, or was he faking? ‘fishy, isn’t it?’ he said in an undertone to Ronald_Weasley ‘malfoy not playing?’ ‘lucky, i call it,’ said Ronald_Weasley looking slightly more animated. ‘and Vaisey off too, he’s their best goal-scorer, i didn’t fancy – hey!’ he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his keeper’s gloves and staring at Harry_Potter. ‘what?’ ‘i … you …’ Ronald_Weasley had dropped his voice; he looked both scared and excited. ‘my drink … my pumpkin juice … you didn’t …?’ Harry_Potter raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, ‘we’ll be starting in about five minutes, you’d better get your boots on.’ they walked out on to the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. one end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. many hufflepuffs and ravenclaws had taken sides, too: amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry_Potter could distinctly hear the roar of Luna_Lovegood’s famous lion-topped hat. Harry_Potter stepped up to madam Rolanda_Hooch, the referee, who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate. ‘captains, shake hands,’ she said, and Harry_Potter had his hand crushed by the new slytherin captain, Urquhart_Rackharrow. ‘mount your brooms. on the whistle … three … two … one …’ the whistle sounded, Harry_Potter and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away. Harry_Potter soared around the perimeter of the grounds looking for the snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. then a voice that was jarringly different from the usual commentator’s started up. ‘well, there they go, and i think we’re all surprised to see the team that potter’s put together this year. many thought, given Ronald_Weasley’s patchy performance as keeper last year, that he might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship with the captain does help …’ these words were greeted with jeers and applause from the slytherin end of the pitch. Harry_Potter craned round on his broom to look towards the commentator’s podium. a tall, skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee_Jordan’s; Harry_Potter recognised Zacharias_Smith, a hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked. ‘oh, and here comes slytherin’s first attempt on goal, it’s Urquhart_Rackharrow streaking down the pitch and –’ Harry_Potter’s stomach turned over. ‘– weasley saves it, well, he’s bound to get lucky sometimes, i suppose …’ ‘that’s right, smith, he is,’ muttered Harry_Potter, grinning to himself, as he dived amongst the chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive snitch. with half an hour of the game gone, gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, Ronald_Weasley having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginevra_Weasley having scored four of gryffindor’s six goals. this effectively stopped Zacharias_Smith wondering loudly whether the two weasleys were only there because Harry_Potter liked them, and he started on peakes and coote instead. ‘of course, coote isn’t really the usual build for a beater,’ said Zacharias_Smith loftily, ‘they’ve generally got a bit more muscle –’ ‘hit a bludger at him!’ Harry_Potter called to coote as he zoomed past, but coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Harry_Potter in the opposite direction. Harry_Potter was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the bludger had found its mark. it seemed as though gryffindor could do no wrong. again and again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the pitch, Ronald_Weasley saved goals with apparent ease. he was actually smiling now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a rousing chorus of the old favourite weasley is our king, he pretended to conduct them from on high. ‘thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?’ said a snide voice, and Harry_Potter was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. ‘your blood-traitor pal …’ madam Rolanda_Hooch’s back was turned, and though gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she looked round Harper had already sped off. his shoulder aching, Harry_Potter raced after him, determined to ram him back … ‘and i think Harper of slytherin’s seen the snitch!’ said Zacharias_Smith through his megaphone. ‘yes, he’s certainly seen something potter hasn’t!’ smith really was an idiot, thought Harry_Potter, hadn’t he noticed them collide? but next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky – smith was right and Harry_Potter was wrong: Harper had not sped upwards at random; he had spotted what Harry_Potter had not: the snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky. Harry_Potter accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of smith’s commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper got there first gryffindor had lost … and now Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched … ‘oi, Harper!’ yelled Harry_Potter in desperation. ‘how much did malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?’ he did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a double take; he fumbled the snitch, let it slip through his fingers and shot right past it: Harry_Potter made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and caught it. ‘yes!’ Harry_Potter yelled: wheeling round, he hurtled back towards the ground, the snitch held high in his hand. as the crowd realised what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signalled the end of the game. ‘Ginevra_Weasley, where’re you going?’ yelled Harry_Potter, who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team, but Ginevra_Weasley sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentator’s podium. as the crowd shrieked and laughed, the gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias_Smith was feebly stirring; Harry_Potter heard Ginevra_Weasley saying blithely to an irate professor Minerva_McGonagall, ‘forgot to brake, professor, sorry.’ laughing, Harry_Potter broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginevra_Weasley, but let go very quickly. avoiding her gaze, he clapped a cheering Ronald_Weasley on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air and waving to their supporters. the atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. ‘party up in the common room, Seamus_Finnigan said!’ yelled Dean_Thomas exuberantly. ‘c’mon, Ginevra_Weasley, Demelza_Robins!’ Ronald_Weasley and Harry_Potter were the last two in the changing room. they were just about to leave when Hermione_Granger entered. she was twisting her gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined. ‘i want a word with you, Harry_Potter.’ she took a deep breath. ‘you shouldn’t have done it. you heard slughorn, it’s illegal.’ ‘what are you going to do, turn us in?’ demanded Ronald_Weasley ‘what are you two talking about?’ asked Harry_Potter, turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning. ‘you know perfectly well what we’re talking about!’ said Hermione_Granger shrilly. ‘you spiked ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast! felix felicis!’ ‘no i didn’t,’ said Harry_Potter, turning back to face them both. ‘yes you did, Harry_Potter, and that’s why everything went right, there were slytherin players missing and Ronald_Weasley saved everything!’ ‘i didn’t put it in!’ said Harry_Potter, now grinning broadly. he slipped his hand inside his Jack_Sloperet pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione_Granger had seen in his hand that morning. it was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. ‘i wanted Ronald_Weasley to think i’d done it, so i faked it when i knew you were looking.’ he looked at Ronald_Weasley ‘you saved everything because you felt lucky. you did it all yourself.’ he pocketed the potion again. ‘there really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?’ Ronald_Weasley said, astounded. ‘but the weather’s good … and Vaisey couldn’t play … i honestly haven’t been given lucky potion?’ Harry_Potter shook his head. Ronald_Weasley gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Hermione_Granger, imitating her voice. ‘you added felix felicis to ron’s juice this morning, that’s why he saved everything! see! i can save goals without help, Hermione_Granger!’ ‘i never said you couldn’t – Ronald_Weasley you thought you’d been given it, too!’ but Ronald_Weasley had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder. ‘er,’ said Harry_Potter into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this, ‘shall … shall we go up to the party, then?’ ‘you go!’ said Hermione_Granger, blinking back tears. ‘i’m sick of Ronald_Weasley at the moment, i don’t know what i’m supposed to have done …’ and she stormed out of the changing room, too. Harry_Potter walked slowly back up the grounds towards the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of let-down; he had been sure that if Ronald_Weasley won the match, he and Hermione_Granger would be friends again immediately. he did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione_Granger that what she had done to offend Ronald_Weasley was kiss Viktor_Krum, not when the offence had occurred so long ago. Harry_Potter could not see Hermione_Granger at the gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when he arrived. renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him. what with trying to shake off the creevey brothers, who wanted a blow- by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ronald_Weasley at last, he extricated himself from Romilda_Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to slughorn’s christmas party with him. as he was ducking towards the drinks table he walked straight into Ginevra_Weasley, Arnold the pygmy puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing Hope_Howellfully at her heels. ‘looking for Ronald_Weasley’ she asked, smirking. ‘he’s over there, the filthy hypocrite.’ Harry_Potter looked into the corner she was indicating. there, in full view of the whole room, stood Ronald_Weasley wrapped so closely around Lavender_Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose. ‘it looks like he’s eating her face, doesn’t it?’ said Ginevra_Weasley dispassionately. ‘but i suppose he’s got to refine his technique somehow. good game, Harry_Potter.’ she patted him on the arm; Harry_Potter felt a swooping sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold. Harry_Potter turned away from Ronald_Weasley who did not look like surfacing soon, just in time to see the portrait hole closing. with a sinking feeling he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight. he darted forwards, sidestepped Romilda_Vane again, and pushed open the portrait of the Fat_Lady. the corridor outside seemed to be deserted. ‘Hermione_Granger?’ he found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. she was sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry_Potter could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this. ‘oh, hello, Harry_Potter,’ she said in a brittle voice. ‘i was just practising.’ ‘yeah … they’re – er – really good …’ said Harry_Potter. he had no idea what to say to her. he was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ronald_Weasley that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, ‘ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations.’ ‘er … does he?’ said Harry_Potter. ‘don’t pretend you didn’t see him,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘he wasn’t exactly hiding it, was –’ the door behind them burst open. to Harry_Potter’s horror, Ronald_Weasley came in, laughing, pulling Lavender_Brown by the hand. ‘oh,’ he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry_Potter and Hermione_Granger. ‘oops!’ said Lavender_Brown, and she backed out of the room, giggling. the door swung shut behind her. there was a horrible swelling, billowing silence. Hermione_Granger was staring at Ronald_Weasley who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, ‘hi, Harry_Potter! wondered where you’d got to!’ Hermione_Granger slid off the desk. the little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system. ‘you shouldn’t leave Lavender_Brown waiting outside,’ she said quietly. ‘she’ll wonder where you’ve gone.’ she walked very slowly and erectly towards the door. Harry_Potter glanced at Ronald_Weasley who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened. ‘oppugno!’ came a shriek from the doorway. Harry_Potter spun round to see Hermione_Granger pointing her wand at Ronald_Weasley her expression wild: the little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets towards Ronald_Weasley who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach. ‘gerremoffme!’ he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione_Granger wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Harry_Potter thought he heard a sob before it slammed.
