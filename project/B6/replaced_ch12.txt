— chapter twelve — silver and opals where was Albus_Dumbledore, and what was he doing? Harry_Potter caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. he rarely appeared at meals any more, and Harry_Potter was sure Hermione_Granger was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. had Albus_Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry_Potter? Albus_Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry_Potter had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned. halfway through october came their first trip of the term to hogsmeade. Harry_Potter had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours. Harry_Potter woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of advanced potion-making. he did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behaviour, as Ronald_Weasley rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione_Granger, who was simply weird that way. Harry_Potter felt, however, that the Severus_Snape’s copy of advanced potion-making hardly qualified as a textbook. the more Harry_Potter pored over the book, the more he realised how much was in there, not only the handy hints and short cuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins which Harry_Potter was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the prince had invented himself. Harry_Potter had already attempted a few of the prince’s self-invented spells. there had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus_Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being    overheard. the only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione_Granger, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry_Potter had used the muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity. sitting up in bed, Harry_Potter turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the prince some trouble. there were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble: levicorpus (n-vbl) while the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows and Neville_Longbottom snored loudly, Harry_Potter stared at the letters in brackets. n-vbl … that had to mean non-verbal. Harry_Potter rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with non-verbal spells, something snape had been quick to comment on in every dada class. on the other hand, the prince had proved a much more effective teacher than snape so far. pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said levicorpus! inside his head. ‘aaaaaaaargh!’ there was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: everyone had woken up as Ronald_Weasley had let out a yell. Harry_Potter sent advanced potion-making flying in panic; Ronald_Weasley was dangling upside-down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle. ‘sorry!’ yelled Harry_Potter, as Dean_Thomas and Seamus_Finnigan roared with laughter and Neville_Longbottom picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of bed. ‘hang on – i’ll let you down –’ he groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell: praying that this was the counter-jinx, Harry_Potter thought liberacorpus! with all his might. there was another flash of light and Ronald_Weasley fell in a heap on to his mattress. ‘sorry,’ repeated Harry_Potter weakly, while Dean_Thomas and Seamus_Finnigan continued to roar with laughter. ‘tomorrow,’ said Ronald_Weasley in a muffled voice, ‘i’d rather you set the alarm clock.’ by the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Molly_Weasley’s hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves and gloves, ron’s shock had subsided and he had decided that Harry_Potter’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione_Granger with the story as they sat down for breakfast. ‘… and then there was another flash of light and i landed on the bed again!’ grinned Ronald_Weasley helping himself to sausages. Hermione_Granger had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry_Potter. ‘was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?’ she asked. Harry_Potter frowned at her. ‘always jump to the worst conclusion, don’t you?’ ‘was it?’ ‘well … yeah, it was, but so what?’ ‘so you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen?’ ‘why does it matter if it’s handwritten?’ said Harry_Potter, preferring not to answer the rest of the question. ‘because it’s probably not ministry of magic-approved,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘and also,’ she added, as Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley rolled their eyes, ‘because i’m starting to think this prince character was a bit dodgy.’ both Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley shouted her down at once. ‘it was a laugh!’ said Ronald_Weasley up-ending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. ‘just a laugh, Hermione_Granger, that’s all!’ ‘dangling people upside-down by the ankle?’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?’ ‘Fred_Weasley and George_Weasley,’ said Ronald_Weasley shrugging, ‘it’s their kind of thing. and, er –’ ‘my dad,’ said Harry_Potter. he had only just remembered. ‘what?’ said Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger together. ‘my dad used this spell,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘i – lupin told me.’ this last part was not true; in fact, Harry_Potter had seen his father use the spell on snape, but he had never told Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger about that particular excursion into the pensieve. now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. could the Severus_Snape possibly be –? ‘maybe your dad did use it, Harry_Potter,’ said Hermione_Granger, ‘but he’s not the only one. we’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you’ve forgotten. dangling people in the air. making them float along, asleep, helpless.’ Harry_Potter stared at her. with a sinking feeling he, too, remembered the behaviour of the death eaters at the quidditch world cup. Ronald_Weasley came to his aid. ‘that was different,’ he said robustly. ‘they were abusing it. Harry_Potter and his dad were just having a laugh. you don’t like the prince, Hermione_Granger,’ he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, ‘because he’s better than you at potions –’ ‘it’s got nothing to do with that!’ said Hermione_Granger, her cheeks reddening. ‘i just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don’t even know what they’re for, and stop talking about “the prince” as if it’s his title, i bet it’s just a stupid Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtonname and it doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!’ ‘i don’t see where you get that from,’ said Harry_Potter heatedly, ‘if he’d been a budding death eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being “half- blood”, would he?’ even as he said it, Harry_Potter remembered that his father had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later … ‘the death eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough pure-blood wizards left,’ said Hermione_Granger stubbornly. ‘i expect most of them are half- bloods pretending to be pure. it’s only muggle-borns they hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ronald_Weasley join up.’ ‘there is no way they’d let me be a death eater!’ said Ronald_Weasley indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione_Granger and hitting Ernest_Prangmacmillan on the head. ‘my whole family are blood traitors! that’s as bad as muggle-borns to death eaters!’ ‘and they’d love to have me,’ said Harry_Potter sarcastically. ‘we’d be best pals if they didn’t keep trying to do me in.’ this made Ronald_Weasley laugh; even Hermione_Granger gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginevra_Weasley. ‘hey, Harry_Potter, i’m supposed to give you this.’ it was a scroll of parchment with Harry_Potter’s name written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing. ‘thanks, Ginevra_Weasley … it’s Albus_Dumbledore’s next lesson!’ Harry_Potter told Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents. ‘monday evening!’ he felt suddenly light and happy. ‘want to join us in hogsmeade, Ginevra_Weasley?’ he asked. ‘i’m going with Dean_Thomas – might see you there,’ she replied, waving at them as she left. filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to go into hogsmeade. the process took even longer than normal as filch was triple-checking everybody with his secrecy sensor. ‘what does it matter if we’re smuggling dark stuff out?’ demanded Ronald_Weasley eyeing the long thin secrecy sensor with apprehension. ‘surely you ought to be checking what we bring back in?’ his cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet. the walk into hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry_Potter wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. the road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. more than once Harry_Potter wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached hogsmeade and saw that zonko’s joke shop had been boarded up, Harry_Potter took it as confIrma_Pincetion that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ronald_Weasley pointed with a thickly gloved hand towards honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and Harry_Potter and Hermione_Granger staggered in his wake into the crowded shop. ‘thank god,’ shivered Ronald_Weasley as they were enveloped by warm, toffee- scented air. ‘let’s stay here all afternoon.’ ‘Harry_Potter, m’boy!’ said a booming voice from behind them. ‘oh, no,’ muttered Harry_Potter. the three of them turned to see professor slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystallised pineapple and occupying at least a quarter of the shop. ‘Harry_Potter, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed now!’ said slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. ‘it won’t do, m’boy, i’m determined to have you! miss granger loves them, don’t you?’ ‘yes,’ said Hermione_Granger helplessly, ‘they’re really –’ ‘so why don’t you come along, Harry_Potter?’ demanded slughorn. ‘well, i’ve had quidditch practice, professor,’ said Harry_Potter, who had indeed been scheduling practices every time slughorn had sent him a little violet- ribbon-adorned invitation. this strategy meant that Ronald_Weasley was not left out and they usually had a laugh with Ginevra_Weasley imagining Hermione_Granger shut up with mclaggen and zabini. ‘well, i certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work!’ said slughorn. ‘but a little recreation never hurt anybody. now, how about monday night, you can’t possibly want to practise in this weather …’ ‘i can’t, professor, i’ve got – er – an appointment with professor Albus_Dumbledore that evening.’ ‘unlucky again!’ cried slughorn dramatically. ‘ah, well … you can’t evade me for ever, Harry_Potter!’ and with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ronald_Weasley as though he had been a display of cockroach cluster. ‘i can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,’ said Hermione_Granger, shaking her head. ‘they’re not that bad, you know … they’re even quite fun sometimes …’ but then she caught sight of ron’s expression. ‘oh, look – they’ve got deluxe sugar quills – those would last hours!’ glad that Hermione_Granger had changed the subject, Harry_Potter showed much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than he would normally have done, but Ronald_Weasley continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Hermione_Granger asked him where he wanted to go next. ‘let’s go to the three broomsticks,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘it’ll be warm.’ they bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweet shop. the bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of honeydukes. the street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to chat, just hurrying towards their destinations. the exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the three broomsticks. one was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry_Potter recognised the barman who worked in the other hogsmeade pub, the hog’s head. as Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. they were barely feet from him when Harry_Potter realised who the man was. ‘MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher!’ the squat, bandy-legged man with long straggly ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window. ‘oh, ’ello, ’arry,’ said MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. ‘well, don’t let me keep ya.’ and he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone. ‘are you selling this stuff?’ asked Harry_Potter, watching MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher grabbing an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground. ‘oh, well, gotta scrape a living,’ said MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher. ‘gimme that!’ Ronald_Weasley had stooped down and picked up something silver. ‘hang on,’ Ronald_Weasley said slowly. ‘this looks familiar –’ ‘thank you!’ said MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, snatching the goblet out of ron’s hand and stuffing it back into the case. ‘well, i’ll see you all – ouch!’ Harry_Potter had pinned MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher against the wall of the pub by the throat. holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand. ‘Harry_Potter!’ squealed Hermione_Granger. ‘you took that from Sirius_Black’s house,’ said Harry_Potter, who was almost nose-to- nose with MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. ‘that had the black family crest on it.’ ‘i – no – what –?’ spluttered MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher, who was turning slowly purple. ‘what did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?’ snarled Harry_Potter. ‘i – no –’ ‘give it to me!’ ‘Harry_Potter, you mustn’t!’ shrieked Hermione_Granger, as MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher started to turn blue. there was a bang and Harry_Potter felt his hands fly off MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher’s throat. gasping and spluttering, MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher seized his fallen case, then – crack – he disapparated. Harry_Potter swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher had gone. ‘come back, you thieving –!’ ‘there’s no point, Harry_Potter.’ Nymphadora_Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet. ‘MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher will probably be in london by now. there’s no point yelling.’ ‘he’s Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoned Sirius_Black’s stuff! Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoned it!’ ‘yes, but still,’ said Nymphadora_Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information, ‘you should get out of the cold.’ she watched them through the door of the three broomsticks. the moment he was inside, Harry_Potter burst out, ‘he was Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpingtoning Sirius_Black’s stuff!’ ‘i know, Harry_Potter, but please don’t shout, people are staring,’ whispered Hermione_Granger. ‘go and sit down, i’ll get you a drink.’ Harry_Potter was still fuming when Hermione_Granger returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer. ‘can’t the order control MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher?’ Harry_Potter demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. ‘can’t they at least stop him stealing everything that’s not fixed down when he’s at headquarters?’ ‘shh!’ said Hermione_Granger desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry_Potter with great interest, and zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away. ‘Harry_Potter, i’d be annoyed too, i know it’s your things he’s stealing –’ Harry_Potter gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, grimmauld place. ‘yeah, it’s my stuff!’ he said. ‘no wonder he wasn’t pleased to see me! well, i’m going to tell Albus_Dumbledore what’s going on, he’s the only one who scares MunMundungus_Fletcherus_Fletcher.’ ‘good idea,’ whispered Hermione_Granger, clearly pleased that Harry_Potter was calming down. ‘ron, what are you staring at?’ ‘nothing,’ said Ronald_Weasley hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry_Potter knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot. ‘i expect “nothing”’s in the back getting more firewhisky,’ said Hermione_Granger waspishly. Ronald_Weasley ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence. Harry_Potter was thinking about Sirius_Black, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Hermione_Granger drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ronald_Weasley and the bar. the moment Harry_Potter drained the last drops in his bottle she said, ‘shall we call it a day and go back to school, then?’ the other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves; then followed Katie_Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the high street. Harry_Potter’s thoughts strayed to Ginevra_Weasley as they trudged up the road to hogwarts through the frozen slush. they had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry_Potter, because she and Dean_Thomas were cosily closeted in madam Puddifoot’s teashop, that haunt of happy couples. scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on. it was a little while before Harry_Potter became aware that the voices of Katie_Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller and louder. Harry_Potter squinted at their indistinct figures. the two girls were having an argument about something Katie_Bell was holding in her hand. ‘it’s nothing to do with you, Leanne!’ Harry_Potter heard Katie_Bell say. they rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast, blurring Harry_Potter’s glasses. just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie_Bell was holding; Katie_Bell tugged it back and the package fell to the ground. at once, Katie_Bell rose into the air, not as Ronald_Weasley had done, suspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she were about to fly. yet there was something wrong, something eerie … her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression. Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley Hermione_Granger and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching. then, six feet above the ground, Katie_Bell let out a terrible scream. her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. she screamed and screamed; Leanne started to scream too, and seized Katie_Bell’s ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger rushed forwards to help, but even as they grabbed Katie_Bell’s legs, she fell on top of them; Harry_Potter and Ronald_Weasley managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to recognise any of them. Harry_Potter looked around; the landscape seemed deserted. ‘stay there!’ he shouted at the others over the howling wind. ‘i’m going for help!’ he began to sprint towards the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Katie_Bell had just done and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled round a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs. ‘Rubeus_Hagrid!’ he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen. ‘Harry_Potter!’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. ‘jus’ bin visitin’ Grawp, he’s comin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ –’ ‘Rubeus_Hagrid, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or something –’ ‘wha’?’ said Rubeus_Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry_Potter was saying over the raging wind. ‘someone’s been cursed!’ bellowed Harry_Potter. ‘cursed? who’s bin cursed – not Ronald_Weasley Hermione_Granger?’ ‘no, it’s not them, it’s Katie_Bell – this way …’ together they ran back along the lane. it took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie_Bell, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; Ronald_Weasley Hermione_Granger and Leanne were all trying to quieten her. ‘get back!’ shouted Rubeus_Hagrid. ‘lemme see her!’ ‘something’s happened to her!’ sobbed Leanne. ‘i don’t know what –’ Rubeus_Hagrid stared at Katie_Bell for a second, then, without a word, bent down, scooped her into his arms and ran off towards the castle with her. within seconds, Katie_Bell’s piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind. Hermione_Granger hurried over to Katie_Bell’s Wailing_Widow friend and put an arm around her. ‘it’s Leanne, isn’t it?’ the girl nodded. ‘did it just happen all of a sudden, or –?’ ‘it was when that package tore,’ sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now sodden brown-paper package on the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ronald_Weasley bent down, his hand outstretched, but Harry_Potter seized his arm and pulled him back. ‘don’t touch it!’ he crouched down. an ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of the paper. ‘i’ve seen that before,’ said Harry_Potter, staring at the thing. ‘it was on display in Borgin and burkes ages ago. the label said it was cursed. Katie_Bell must have touched it.’ he looked up at Leanne, who had started to shake uncontrollably. ‘how did Katie_Bell get hold of this?’ ‘well, that’s why we were arguing. she came back from the bathroom in the three broomsticks holding it, said it was a surprise for somebody at hogwarts and she had to deliver it. she looked all funny when she said it … oh no, oh no, i bet she’d been imperiused, and i didn’t realise!’ Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione_Granger patted her shoulder gently. ‘she didn’t say who’d given it to her, Leanne?’ ‘no … she wouldn’t tell me … and i said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn’t listen and … and then i tried to grab it from her … and – and –’ Leanne let out a wail of despair. ‘we’d better get up to school,’ said Hermione_Granger, her arm still around Leanne, ‘we’ll be able to find out how she is. come on …’ Harry_Potter hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring ron’s gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up. ‘we’ll need to show this to madam pomfrey,’ he said. as they followed Hermione_Granger and Leanne up the road, Harry_Potter was thinking furiously. they had just entered the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer. ‘malfoy knows about this necklace. it was in a case at Borgin and burkes four years ago, i saw him having a good look at it while i was hiding from him and his dad. this is what he was buying that day when we followed him! he remembered it and he went back for it!’ ‘i – i dunno, Harry_Potter,’ said Ronald_Weasley hesitantly. ‘loads of people go to Borgin and burkes … and didn’t that girl say Katie_Bell got it in the girls’ bathroom?’ ‘she said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself –’ ‘Minerva_McGonagall!’ said Ronald_Weasley warningly. Harry_Potter looked up. sure enough, professor Minerva_McGonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them. ‘Rubeus_Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie_Bell – upstairs to my office at once, please! what’s that you’re holding, potter?’ ‘it’s the thing she touched,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘good lord,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry_Potter. ‘no, no, filch, they’re with me!’ she added hastily, as filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his secrecy sensor aloft. ‘take this necklace to professor snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!’ Harry_Potter and the others followed professor Minerva_McGonagall upstairs and into her office. the sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. professor Minerva_McGonagall closed the door and swept round her desk to face Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley Hermione_Granger and the still- sobbing Leanne. ‘well?’ she said sharply. ‘what happened?’ haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying, Leanne told professor Minerva_McGonagall how Katie_Bell had gone to the bathroom in the three broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package, how Katie_Bell had seemed a little odd and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open. at this point, Leanne was so overcome there was no getting another word out of her. ‘all right,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, not unkindly, ‘go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get madam pomfrey to give you something for shock.’ when she had left the room, professor Minerva_McGonagall turned back to Harry_Potter, Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger. ‘what happened when Katie_Bell touched the necklace?’ ‘she rose up in the air,’ said Harry_Potter, before either Ronald_Weasley or Hermione_Granger could speak. ‘and then began to scream, and collapsed. professor, can i see professor Albus_Dumbledore, please?’ ‘the headmaster  is away until monday, potter,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, looking surprised. ‘away?’ Harry_Potter repeated angrily. ‘yes, potter, away!’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall tartly. ‘but anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, i’m sure!’ for a split second, Harry_Potter hesitated. professor Minerva_McGonagall did not invite confidences; Albus_Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. this was a life and death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at. ‘i think Draco_Malfoy gave Katie_Bell that necklace, professor.’ on one side of him, Ronald_Weasley rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Hermione_Granger shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry_Potter. ‘that is a very serious accusation, potter,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, after a shocked pause. ‘do you have any proof?’ ‘no,’ said Harry_Potter, ‘but …’ and he told her about following malfoy to Borgin and burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Borgin. when he had finished speaking, professor Minerva_McGonagall looked slightly confused. ‘malfoy took something to Borgin and burkes for repair? ‘no, professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn’t have it with him. but that’s not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time and i think it was that necklace –’ ‘you saw malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?’ ‘no, professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him –’ ‘but, Harry_Potter,’ Hermione_Granger interrupted, ‘Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and malfoy said “no” –’ ‘because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously!’ said Harry_Potter angrily. ‘what he actually said was, “how would i look carrying that down the street?”,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,’ interjected Ronald_Weasley ‘oh, Ronald_Weasley’ said Hermione_Granger despairingly, ‘it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! i think whatever he reserved at Borgin and burkes was noisy or bulky; something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street – and in any case,’ she pressed on loudly, before Harry_Potter could interrupt, ‘i asked Borgin about the necklace, don’t you remember? when i went in to try and find out what malfoy had asked him to keep, i saw it there. and Borgin just told me the price, he didn’t say it was already sold or anything –’ ‘well, you were being really obvious, he realised what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn’t going to tell you – anyway, malfoy could’ve sent off for it since –’ ‘that’s enough!’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, as Hermione_Granger opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. ‘potter, i appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at mr malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. the same is probably true of hundreds of people –’ ‘– that’s what i said –’ muttered Ronald_Weasley ‘– and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year, i do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge –’ ‘– but –’ ‘– and what is more,’ said professor Minerva_McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, ‘mr malfoy was not in hogsmeade today.’ Harry_Potter gaped at her, deflating. ‘how do you know, professor?’ ‘because he was doing detention with me. he has now failed to complete his transfiguration homework twice in a row. so, thank you for telling me your suspicions, potter,’ she said as she marched past them, ‘but i need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie_Bell. good day to you all.’ she held open her office door. they had no choice but to file past her without another word. Harry_Potter was angry with the other two for siding with Minerva_McGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened. ‘so who do you reckon Katie_Bell was supposed to give the necklace to?’ asked Ronald_Weasley as they climbed the stairs to the common room. ‘goodness only knows,’ said Hermione_Granger. ‘but whoever it was has had a narrow escape. no one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.’ ‘it could’ve been meant for loads of people,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘Albus_Dumbledore – the death eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. or slughorn – Albus_Dumbledore reckons voldemort really wanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s sided with Albus_Dumbledore. or –’ ‘or you,’ said Hermione_Granger, looking troubled. ‘couldn’t have been,’ said Harry_Potter, ‘or Katie_Bell would’ve just turned round in the lane and given it to me, wouldn’t she? i was behind her all the way out of the three broomsticks. it would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside hogwarts, what with filch searching everyone who goes in and out. i wonder why malfoy told her to take it into the castle?’ ‘Harry_Potter, malfoy wasn’t in hogsmeade!’ said Hermione_Granger, actually stamping her foot in frustration. ‘he must have used an accomplice, then,’ said Harry_Potter. ‘Crabbe or Goyle – or, come to think of it, another death eater, he’ll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up –’ Ronald_Weasley and Hermione_Granger exchanged looks that plainly said ‘there’s no point arguing with him’. ‘dilligrout,’ said Hermione_Granger firmly, as they reached the Fat_Lady. the portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. it was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. there was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: clearly, the news of Katie_Bell’s fate had not yet spread. ‘it wasn’t a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it,’ said Ronald_Weasley casually turfing a first-year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire, so that he could sit down. ‘the curse didn’t even make it into the castle. not what you’d call foolproof.’ ‘you’re right,’ said Hermione_Granger, prodding Ronald_Weasley out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first-year again. ‘it wasn’t very well-thought-out at all.’ ‘but since when has malfoy been one of the world’s great thinkers?’ asked Harry_Potter. neither Ronald_Weasley nor Hermione_Granger answered him.
